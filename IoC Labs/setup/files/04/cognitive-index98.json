Unfortunately, no effective and specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression are available for clinical use. Increasing evidence implicates vitamin D receptor (VDR) involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Herein, artesunate (AS) was discovered to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression and its molecular mechanism is investigated. Effect of artesunate on sepsis-induced immunosuppression was investigated in mice and in vitro. VDR was predicted to be an interacted candidate of AS by bioinformatics predict, then identified using PCR and immunoblotting. VDR, ATG16L1 and NF-\u03BAB p65 were modified to investigate the alteration of AS\u2019s effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines release, bacteria clearance and autophagy activities in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. AS significantly reduced the mortality of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis immunosuppression mice challenged with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, AS interacted with VDR thereby inhibited the nuclear translocation of VDR, then influencing ATG16L1 transcription and subsequent autophagy activity. In addition, AS inhibited physical interaction between VDR and NF-\u03BAB p65 in LPS tolerance macrophages, then promoted nuclear translocation of NF-\u03BAB p65, which activated the transcription of NF-\u03BAB p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our findings provide an evidence that AS interacted with VDR to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-\u03BAB dependent way, highlighting a novel approach for sepsis treatment and drug repurposing of AS in the future.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shang, Shenglan; Wu, Jiaqi; Li, Xiaoli; Liu, Xin; Li, Pan; Zheng, Chunli; Wang, Yonghua; Liu, Songqing; Zheng, Jiang; Zhou, Hong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea1be53cacd205c1e3f670789cf1d1e558bd2e16.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0a32446730827ad8152c6a61e4738e4e0b231412.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.966143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VDR","PCR","Pseudomonas Aeruginosa"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression","induced sepsis immunosuppression mice","sepsis treatment","NF-\u03BAB p65","nuclear translocation of VDR","transcription of NF","NF-\u03BAB dependent way","nuclear translocation of NF","\u03BAB p65 target genes","specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression","pro-inflammatory cytokines release","autophagy activities","ATG16L1 transcription","Effect of artesunate","evidence","interacted candidate","enhanced proinflammatory cytokines release","subsequent autophagy activity","bacteria clearance","bacterial clearance","alteration of AS\u2019s effect","mortality of cecal ligation","inhibited physical interaction","predominant cause of mortality","Pseudomonas Aeruginosa","novel approach","CLP","LPS tolerance macrophages","puncture","drug repurposing","vitamin D receptor","clinical use","failure","molecular mechanism","addition","bioinformatics","invading pathogens","PCR","future","immunoblotting","findings"],"language":"en"},

Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). There are many subtypes of IAV but only a few seem to be able to adapt to humans and to cause disease. In 2013, an H7N9 IAV subtype emerged in China that does not cause clinical symptoms in its chicken host but leads to severe infections when transmitted into humans. Since 2013, there have been six epidemic waves of H7N9 with 1567 laboratory\u2010confirmed human infections and 615 deaths. Pathogenicity of IAV is complex, but a crucial feature contributing to virulence is the activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein by host proteases that triggers membrane fusion and leads to subsequent virus propagation. METHODS: 293T, VERO, and MDCK cells were used to conduct Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and pseudoparticle and live virus infections, and to evaluate H7N9 HA cleavage\u2010activation. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We show that human matriptase/ST 14 is able to cleave H7N9 HA. Cleavage of H7N9 HA expressed in cell culture results in fusogenic HA and syncytia formation. In infection studies with viral pseudoparticles carrying matriptase/ST 14\u2010activated H7N9 HA, we observed a high infectivity of cells. Finally, human matriptase/ST 14 also activated H7N9 live virus which resulted in high infectivity. Our data demonstrate that human matriptase/ST 14 is a likely candidate protease to promote H7N9 infections in humans.","publish_time":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whittaker, Gary R.; Straus, Marco R.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fd4c59ae94e2ecc44c0c40d678dd18e31ddb7c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7040964.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31820577/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12707","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","MDCK"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 infections","H7N9 HA cleavage","Cleavage of H7N9 HA","activated H7N9 HA","H7N9 live virus","H7N9 IAV subtype","human matriptase","human infections","fusogenic HA","live virus infections","epidemic waves of H7N9","humans","severe infections","influenza viruses","Pathogenicity of IAV","subtypes of IAV","subsequent virus propagation","high infectivity of cells","activation","deaths","membrane fusion","fusion protein","host proteases","chicken host","MDCK cells","zoonotic disease","cell culture results","immunofluorescence assays","likely candidate protease","Western blot analysis","viral pseudoparticles","hemagglutinin","China","laboratory","millions of people","syncytia formation","year","VERO","virulence","clinical symptoms","crucial feature","infection studies","hundreds of thousands","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","data","METHODS","devastating pandemics"],"language":"en"},

The possible etiologies of infection are diverse, ranging from common bacterial and viral pathogens that affect the entire community to opportunistic pathogens that cause invasive disease only in immunocompromised hosts. Antimicrobial therapies required to treat established infection are often complex, with accompanying risks for drug toxicities and drug interactions with the immunosuppressive agents used to maintain graft function. Rapid and specific diagnosis is essential for successful therapy. The risk of serious infections in the organ transplant patient is largely determined by the interaction between two factors: the patient\u2019s epidemiologic exposures and the patient\u2019s net state of immunosuppression. The epidemiology of infection includes environmental exposures and nosocomial infections, organisms derived from donor tissues, and latent infections from the recipient activated with immunosuppression. The net state of immune suppression is a conceptual framework that measures those factors contributing to risk for infection: the dose, duration, and temporal sequence of immunosuppressive drugs; the presence of foreign bodies or injuries to mucocutaneous barriers; neutropenia; metabolic abnormalities including diabetes; devitalized tissues, hematomas, or effusions postsurgery; and infection with immunomodulating viruses. Multiple factors are present in each host. A timeline exists to aid in the development of a differential diagnosis for infection. The timeline for each patient is altered by changes in prophylaxis and immunosuppressive drugs. For common infections, new microbiologic assays, often nucleic acid based, are useful in the diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fishman, Jay A.; Costa, Sylvia F.; Alexander, Barbara D.","journal":"Kidney Transplantation - Principles and Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8038392ec9599f16ac10c3b0ce3be01a7dfc275.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152057.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323531863000310; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323531863000310","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["established infection","epidemiology of infection","common infections","nosocomial infections","latent infections","radiologic findings of infection","possible etiologies of infection","management of opportunistic infections","risk of serious infections","immunosuppressive agents","organ transplant patient","opportunistic pathogens","patient\u2019s net state of immunosuppression","specific diagnosis","differential diagnosis","Multiple factors","timeline","temporal sequence of immunosuppressive drugs","patient\u2019s epidemiologic exposures","organ transplant recipients","drug interactions","drug toxicities","devitalized tissues","donor tissues","environmental exposures","viral pathogens","net state of immune suppression","impaired inflammatory responses","mucocutaneous barriers","metabolic abnormalities","presence of foreign bodies","injuries","neutropenia","diabetes","new microbiologic assays","accompanying risks","effusions postsurgery","organisms","invasive disease","entire community","nucleic acid","hematomas","dose","duration","conceptual framework","successful therapy","Abstract","changes","prophylaxis","development","immunomodulating viruses","immunocompromised hosts","graft function","Antimicrobial therapies"],"language":"en"},

Methods All members of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) were invited to answer a web-based survey. Results Data of 121 hospitals from all 20 Italian regions were analyzed. Overall, 10.7% Gastroenterology Divisions have been converted to Covid Units. Outpatients consultations, endoscopic and ultrasound procedures were limited to urgencies and oncology indications in 85.1%, 96.2% and 72.2% of Units, respectively, and 46.7% of them suspended the screening for colorectal cancer. Moreover, 72.2% of the staff received a training for use of personal protective equipment, although 45.5% did not have sufficient devices for adequate replacement. Overall, 132 healthcare workers in 41 Gastroenterology Divisions were found to be infected. Conclusion This is the first study to evaluate, at a country level, the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Gastroenterology Divisions. Substantial changes of practice and reduction of procedures have been recorded in the entire country.

In this study, we established persistent infection of SARS-CoV in the Vero E6 cell line. Acute infection of Vero E6 with SARS-CoV produced a lytic infection with characteristic rounding cytopathic effects (CPE) and the production of a large number of infectious particles in the culture fluid within 3 days post-infection. Upon subsequent culturing of the remaining adherent cells, the cells gradually proliferated and recovered normal morphology similar to that of the parental cells, and continued to produce large numbers of infectious viral particles during the observation period of 5 months. Among a total of 87 cell clones obtained from the persistently infected Vero E6, only four cell clones (named #13, #18, #21, and #34) were positive for viral RNA. Clones #13, #18, and #34 shifted to viral RNA-negative during subsequent cultures, while #21 continuously produced infectious particles at a high rate. The SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, was almost completely down regulated from the cell surface of persistently infected cells. Western blot analysis as well as electron microscopy indicated that the ratios of spike to nucleocapsid protein in clone #21 as well as its parental persistently infected cells were lower than that in the cells in the acute phase of infection. These Vero E6 cells persistently infected with SARS-CoV may be useful for clarifying the mechanism of the persistent infection and also for elucidating the possible pathophysiologic significance of such long-term maintenance of this virus.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamate, Masanobu; Yamashita, Makiko; Goto, Toshiyuki; Tsuji, Shoutaro; Li, Yong-Gang; Warachit, Jiranan; Yunoki, Mikihiro; Ikuta, Kazuyoshi","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9a8d6b354786129252397c1d8a43621e4fd3ec8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110502.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457905002005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457905002005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cells","persistent infection of SARS","Vero E6 cells","Acute infection of Vero E6","parental cells","lytic infection","infected Vero E6","SARS-CoV receptor","acute phase of infection","cell clones","Vero E6 cell line","days post-infection","remaining adherent cells","persistent infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome","cell surface","large numbers of infectious viral particles","large number of infectious particles","viral RNA-negative","subsequent cultures","subsequent culturing","culture fluid","characteristic","cytopathic effects","long-term maintenance","electron microscopy","ratios of spike","production","observation period","coronavirus","Abstract Little information","possible pathophysiologic significance","nucleocapsid protein","CPE","angiotensin","Western blot analysis","normal morphology similar","enzyme","high rate","mechanism","months","total","study"],"language":"en"},

T. vegrandis appears to be geographically dispersed, has a wide distribution in Australia and low levels of host specificity.","publish_time":"2015-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Austen, Jill M.; O\u0027Dea, Mark; Jackson, Bethany; Ryan, Una","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec8e3ea55225e640b712fdc0e0f9dde93ac10e01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116909.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401715300546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26541211/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.10.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401715300546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["bats","report of Trypanosoma vegrandis","Australia","present study","PCR prevalence","high prevalence","sequence analysis","low levels of host specificity","morphology","wide distribution","epidemiology","S rRNA gene","important role"],"language":"en"},

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of S1 of seven strains of the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype and the first 337 bases of two additional Mass strains. Despite the fact that the strains had been isolated over three decades in Europe and the U.S.A. there was only 4% base and 6% amino acid variation within the group. Nearly one third of the 32 amino acid differences in S1 were in two hypervariable regions (HVRs 1 and 2) comprising residues 38\u201351 and 99\u2013115, identified by Niesters et al. (1986), showing that HVRs 1 and 2 are a feature of the Mass serotype. Amino acid variation within HVRs 1 and 2 was 29% and 40% respectively. Five vaccine strains could be distinguished from each other by sequencing of the first 337 nucleotides. Variants of M41 which resisted neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies (A13 and A38) had the same, single base change at position 134, resulting in substitution of proline residue 45 by histidine.

It first spread within Guangdong Province and then to other parts of China. Via air travelers, it quickly reached various countries around the globe, causing several major hospital outbreaks. Within weeks, the causative agent, a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified, thanks to an unprecedented international effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its origin was quickly traced to wild animals traded locally for culinary purposes. Masked palm civet and some other species seem to have acted as intermediate hosts. Since then, SARS-like coronaviruses were found in different bat species in China and elsewhere, and bats are now regarded as the wildlife reservoir for SARS-CoV. Fortunately, the SARS outbreak could be contained within months. Until July 2003, it had caused 8096 cases, with 774 deaths. Once adequate measures such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts were strictly adhered to, further transmission between human beings could be interrupted. SARS is an example of how rapidly an infectious agent can spread in the modern world. At the same time, it should serve as a showcase of how international cooperation and modern science can help to combat the spread of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berger, A.; Preiser, W.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Environmental Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5fccd8c4de80316f3a93c71f76c6165a00b0256.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152051.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444639516006240; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444639516006240","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS"],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS outbreak","modern world","infectious agent","southern China","parts of China","spread of infectious diseases","international cooperation","causative agent","modern science","unprecedented international effort","different bat species","World Health Organization","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","globe","unknown coronavirus","wild animals","isolating patients","thanks","coronaviruses","various countries","wildlife reservoir","culinary purposes","adequate measures","major hospital outbreaks","Masked palm civet","showcase","example","air travelers","transmission","human beings","Guangdong Province","origin","contacts","weeks","bats","months","intermediate hosts","cases","deaths","time"],"language":"en"},

We sought to measure geographic access to these centers in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of geographic access to high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers in the United States. We defined high capability centers using two criteria: (1) provision of adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), based on either 2008\u20132013 Extracorporeal Life Support Organization reporting or provision of ECMO to 2010 Medicare beneficiaries; or (2) high annual hospital mechanical ventilation volume, based 2010 Medicare claims. SETTING: Nonfederal acute care hospitals in the United States. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We defined geographic access as the percentage of the state, region and national population with either direct or hospital-transferred access within one or two hours by air or ground transport. Of 4,822 acute care hospitals, 148 hospitals met our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals met our mechanical ventilation criteria. Geographic access varied substantially across states and regions in the United States, depending on center criteria. Without interhospital transfer, an estimated 58.5% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 79.0% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. With interhospital transfer and under ideal circumstances, an estimated 96.4% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 98.6% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. However, this degree of geographic access required substantial interhospital transfer of patients, including up to two hours by air. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic access to high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers varies widely across states and regions in the United States. Adequate referral center access in the case of disasters and pandemics will depend highly on local and regional care coordination across political boundaries.","publish_time":"2014-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallace, David J.; Angus, Derek C.; Seymour, Christopher W.; Yealy, Donald M.; Carr, Brendan G.; Kurland, Kristen; Boujoukos, Arthur; Kahn, Jeremy M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23696844593c72dd8c4d74607ff26049336fe9b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3976413.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705417/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094057","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Extracorporeal Life Support Organization","ECMO","Medicare"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["degree of geographic access","Cross-sectional analysis of geographic access","United States","Nonfederal acute care hospitals","ECMO criteria","high capability centers","high annual volume of mechanical ventilation","Adequate referral center access","mechanical ventilation criteria","high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers","high annual hospital mechanical ventilation volume","provision of ECMO","national adult population","national population","center criteria","Optimal care of adults","regional care coordination","substantial interhospital transfer of patients","regions","hours","air","provision of adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Medicare beneficiaries","Medicare claims","Extracorporeal Life Support Organization","specific resources","case of disasters","political boundaries","expertise","ideal circumstances","MAIN RESULTS","percentage","DESIGN","SETTING","CONCLUSIONS","pandemics","ground transport","OBJECTIVE","MEASUREMENTS"],"language":"en"},

Microarray technologies commonly used for the detection and identification of microbial targets include solid-state microarrays, electronic microarrays and bead suspension microarrays. Microarray methods have been applied to microbial detection, genotyping and antimicrobial resistance gene detection. Microarrays can offer a panel approach to diagnose specific patient presentations, such as respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, and can discriminate isolates by genotype for tracking epidemiology and outbreak investigations. And, as more information has become available on specific genes and pathways involved in antimicrobial resistance, we are beginning to be able to predict susceptibility patterns based on sequence detection for particular organisms. With further advances in automated microarray processing methods and genotype\u2013phenotype prediction algorithms, these tests will become even more useful as an adjunct or replacement for conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing, allowing for more rapid selection of targeted therapy for infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Steve; Karaoz, Ulas; Brodie, Eoin; Dunbar, Sherry","journal":"Methods in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f1ae15937513f5664cf67120252a5d450f985cc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0580951715000033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0580951715000033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microarray methods","microbial detection","Microarray technologies","electronic microarrays","solid-state microarrays","sequence detection","antimicrobial resistance gene detection","automated microarray processing methods","genotype","bead suspension microarrays","conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing","identification of microbial targets","specific genes","susceptibility patterns","multiple targets","molecular technologies","specific patient presentations","replacement","phenotype prediction algorithms","rapid selection of targeted therapy","isolates","tracking epidemiology","panel approach","pathways","infectious diseases","tests","outbreak investigations","advances","gastrointestinal infections","Abstract Advancements","new platforms","particular organisms","use","clinical microbiology laboratory","multiplexing","ability","information","diagnostics","specimen"],"language":"en"},

NSP2 exists as stable doughnut-shaped octamers within the infected cell, representing the tail-to-tail interaction of two tetramers. Extending diagonally across the surface of each octamer are four highly basic grooves that function as binding sites for single-stranded RNA. Between the N and C-terminal domains of each monomer is a deep electropositive cleft containing a catalytic site that hydrolyzes the \u03B3-\u03B2 phosphoanhydride bond of any NTP. The catalytic site has similarity to those of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-binding proteins. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, we investigated the possibility that the RNA-binding activity of the groove promoted the insertion of the 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety of the RNA into the cleft, and the subsequent hydrolysis of its \u03B3-\u03B2 phosphoanhydride bond. Our results show that NSP2 hydrolyzes the \u03B3P from RNAs and NTPs through Mg(2\u002B)-dependent activities that proceed with similar reaction velocities, that require the catalytic His(225) residue, and that produce a phosphorylated intermediate. Competition assays indicate that although both substrates enter the active site, RNA is the preferred substrate due to its higher affinity for the octamer. The RTPase activity of NSP2 may account for the absence of 5\u2032-terminal \u03B3P on the (\u2212) strands of the dsRNA genome segments. This is the first report of a HIT-like protein with a multifunctional catalytic site, capable of accommodating both NTPs and RNAs during \u03B3P hydrolysis.","publish_time":"2006-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carpio, Rodrigo Vasquez-Del; Gonzalez-Nilo, Fernando D.; Riadi, Gonzalo; Taraporewala, Zenobia F.; Patton., John T.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d81a5153031b645b3606f780c6a9fb6a8b2283a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1924841.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606009284; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606009284; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1924841?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-binding activity","multifunctional catalytic site","single-stranded RNA","double-stranded RNA genome","abundant nonstructural RNA-binding protein essential","binding sites","binding proteins","active site","\u03B3P hydrolysis","Rotavirus NSP2","terminal \u03B3P","RTPase activity of NSP2","\u03B3-\u03B2 phosphoanhydride bond","HIT","RNAs","NTPs","subsequent hydrolysis","basic grooves","tail interaction","deep electropositive cleft","C-terminal domains","dsRNA genome segments","capable of accommodating","monomer","family of nucleotide","preferred substrate","stable doughnut-shaped octamers","viral factories","replication","substrates","infected cell","histidine triad","similar reaction velocities","clefts","higher affinity","strands","similarity","possibility","dependent activities","close proximity","insertion","triphosphate moiety","absence","Competition assays","tetramers","residue","report","results","surface"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to establish an epithelial cell line from caruncles of pregnant cows and to develop a model to study restricted trophoblast invasion, pathogenesis of pregnancy associated diseases and pathways of infection and transport. Primary epithelial cells were isolated, successfully subcultured for 32 passages and cryopreserved at various stages. The cultures were termed bovine caruncular epithelial cell line-1 (BCEC-1). Cytokeratin, zonula occludens-1 protein and vimentin but neither \u03B1-smooth muscle actin nor desmin were detected by immunofluorescence performed every 5 (\u00B11) passages. These results were confirmed by Western blotting. BCEC-1 were then cultured either without matrix or on fibronectin or collagen coated Transwell\u00AE polyester membrane inserts, respectively, enabling separate access to the basal or apical epithelial compartments. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of BCEC-1 revealed ultrastructural features also observed in vivo, such as apical microvilli and junctional complexes. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured regularly and revealed an increase with advancing confluence in all cultures. Cultures on coated inserts reached confluence and corresponding TEER-levels at an earlier stage. In addition, the cells were tested negative for bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) virus, but were permissive for the virus. In conclusion, the BCEC-1 cell line retained characteristics of maternal caruncular epithelial cells as observed in vivo and in primary cell cultures and thus will be a highly useful tool for future studies of pathways of invasion, fetal\u2013maternal communication, transport and infection.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bridger, P.

CEACAM10-sperm binding greatly enhanced sperm motility in vitro.","publish_time":"2005-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Sheng-Hsiang; Lee, Robert Kuo-Kuang; Hsiao, Ya-Ling; Chen, Yee-Hsiung","journal":"Biol Reprod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a149b2f9bea8d1613f854c545d192ab142e8dfaf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEACAM10-sperm","Ceacam10 mRNA","cessation of Ceacam10 expression","CEACAM10 binding region","circular dichromoism spectrum of CEACAM10","corn oil restored Ceacam10 expression","mouse seminal vesicle secretions","seminal vesicles of adult mice","ion exchange chromatography","entire surface of mouse sperm","Castration of adult mice","treatment of castrated mice","ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography","enhanced sperm motility","sulfopropyl column","DEAE-Sephacel column","entire course of pregnancy","testosterone propionate","series of purification steps","presence","mucosal folds","N-linked carbohydrate moiety","\u03B2 form","negative band","luminal epithelium","kDa glycoprotein","phosphate buffer","stage of animal maturation","cytochemical study","nm","embryo"],"language":"en"},

To address this issue, we have developed a novel procedure for large-scale preparation of bacterial cell extract with high protein synthesis activity. The developed procedure comprises cell cultivation using a fermentor, harvesting and washing of cells by tangential flow filtration, cell disruption with high-pressure homogenizer and continuous diafiltration. By optimizing and combining these methods, \u223C100 ml of the cell extract was prepared from 150 g of Escherichia coli cells. The protein synthesis activities, defined as the yield of protein per unit of absorbance at 260 nm of the cell extract, were shown to be reproducible, and the average activity of several batches was twice that obtained using a previously reported method. In addition, combinatorial use of the high-pressure homogenizer and diafiltration increased the scalability, indicating that the cell concentration at disruption varies from 0.04 to 1 g/ml. Furthermore, addition of Gam protein and examinations of the N-terminal sequence rendered the extract prepared here useful for rapid screening with linear DNA templates.","publish_time":"2017-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katsura, Kazushige; Matsuda, Takayoshi; Tomabechi, Yuri; Yonemochi, Mayumi; Hanada, Kazuharu; Ohsawa, Noboru; Sakamoto, Kensaku; Takemoto, Chie; Shirouzu, Mikako","journal":"J Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae45992c96712b64942b02da4271ff90a6620671.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Escherichia"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell disruption","Cell-free protein synthesis","cell cultivation","cell concentration","large-scale production of cell extract","protein synthesis activities","high protein synthesis activity","yield of protein","large-scale preparation of bacterial cell extract","addition of Gam protein","high-pressure homogenizer","useful method","average activity","developed procedure","novel procedure","continuous diafiltration","batch variability","g of Escherichia coli cells","reported method","problem","rapid screening","examinations","tangential flow filtration","proteins","N-terminal sequence","scalability","regard","linear DNA templates","combinatorial use","unit of absorbance","fermentor","nm","structural analyses","laboratory","batches","issue","methods"],"language":"en"},

In this study, 209 probable SARS cases with documented episodes of exposure between March 1 and May 31, 2003, in mainland China were included. A nonparametric method was used to analyze these data with defined periods of exposure to obtain the refined estimate of the SARS incubation period. Furthermore, the authors also explored the influence of various factors on the SARS incubation period by analysis of variance, linear regression analysis, and analysis of covariance. The estimates of mean and variance of the SARS incubation period were 5.29 days and 12.33 days(2), respectively; 90% of patients would have an incubation period of less than 11.58 days with a probability of 0.8, and 99% of patients would have an incubation of less than 22.22 days with a probability of 0.9.

In Exp. 1, during 2 consecutive years, 226 or 192 Angus and Angus crossbred steers were fed a high-grain diet containing either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn, or both. When measured on a BW basis, steers fed only PAP-Sb had a greater G:F (P \u003C 0.05) than those fed no PAP. Nevertheless, when both PAP were fed, feed efficiency was similar (P \u003E 0.10) to steers fed no PAP or only PAP-Sb. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased (P \u003C 0.05) dressing percentage. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased severity of liver abscess (P \u003C 0.05).

STUDY DESIGN: Inception cohort study with 50 conscripts with ARS. METHODS: We collected peripheral blood high\u2010sensitive C\u2010reactive protein (hs\u2010CRP), white blood cell (WBC), procalcitonin, and nasal nitric oxide (nNO) counts at 2 to 3 and 9 to 10 days of symptoms during an ARS episode. We simultaneously gathered various clinical parameters and microbiological samples. Bacterial ARS was confirmed with a positive culture of sinus aspirate. RESULTS: Reciprocal correlations and a significant change in biomarker levels between the two visits suggest that ARS involves a local and systemic inflammatory response that was strongest at 2 to 3 days. High\u2010sensitive CRP and nNO reflected responses best (52% had increased CRP levels at 2\u20133 days; 66% had decreased nNO levels). White blood cell and procalcitonin counts rarely exceeded the reference range. Increased local and systemic inflammatory response were linked to multiple, adenoviral, or influenza A viral etiology or the detection of bacterial ARS. Local response correlated with imaging findings of wide paranasal sinus involvement and ostiomeatal complex occlusion. At 9 to 10 days, elevated (\u2265 11 mg/L) and moderately elevated (\u2265 49 mg/L) hs\u2010CRP predicted bacterial ARS well (likelihood ratio [LR]\u002B 3.3 and LR\u002B 15.8, respectively), but the sensitivity for both findings remained low. CONCLUSION: Acute rhinosinusitis (particularly bacterial ARS) involves a local and systemic inflammatory response that is strongest at the beginning of symptoms. Elevated hs\u2010CRP supports the diagnosis of bacterial ARS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

While inability to adjust for all baseline variables prevents comparison to historical cohorts in Korea where oliguria has been reported in 39\u201369% cases and dialysis required in approximately 40% HFRS cases caused by Hantaan virus, the occurrence of 3% oliguria and 0% dialysis requirement in the treatment cohort is supportive of a previous placebo-controlled HFRS trial in China where IV ribavirin given early resulted in decreased occurrence of oliguria and decreased severity of renal insufficiency.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rusnak, Janice M.; Byrne, William R.; Chung, Kyung N.; Gibbs, Paul H.; Kim, Theodore T.; Boudreau, Ellen F.; Cosgriff, Thomas; Pittman, Philip; Kim, Katie Y.; Erlichman, Marianne S.; Rezvani, David F.; Huggins, John W.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23dade1e22f513bf2a5375a1aa7c45da363dcdef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127354.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635420800421X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.09.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635420800421X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18977392/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["HFRS"],"locations":["Korea","China"],"keyphrases":["individuals","HFRS cases","ribavirin therapy","decreased occurrence of oliguria","clinical course of HFRS","fewer doses of ribavirin","main adverse event of ribavirin","subsequent serological confirmation of HFRS","treatment cohort","clinical study","treatment initiation","mean peak serum creatinine","mean day","treatment analysis","dialysis requirement","Korea","previous placebo-controlled HFRS trial","renal syndrome","decreased severity of renal insufficiency","hemorrhagic fever","historical cohorts","Department of Defense personnel","onset of polyuria","baseline variables","comparison","China","Reversible hemolytic anemia","Hantaan virus","Abstract Results","subjects","inability","illness","total","hematocrit"],"language":"en"},

Each viral RdRP contains a 500\u2013600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven polymerase catalytic motifs are located in the RdRP palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRP and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Functional regions are often found fused to the RdRP catalytic module, resulting in a high level of diversity in RdRP global structure and regulatory mechanism. In this review, we surveyed all 46 RdRP-sequence available virus families of the positive-strand RNA viruses listed in the 2018b collection of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) and chose a total of 49 RdRPs as representatives. By locating hallmark residues in RdRP catalytic motifs and by referencing structural and functional information in the literature, we were able to estimate the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the catalytic module in these RdRPs, which in turn serve as reference points to predict additional functional regions beyond the catalytic module. Interestingly, a large number of virus families may have additional regions fused to the RdRP N-terminus, while only a few of them have such regions on the C-terminal side of the RdRP. The current knowledge on these additional regions, either in three-dimensional (3D) structure or in function, is quite limited. In the five RdRP-structure available virus families in the positive-strand RNA viruses, only the Flaviviridae family has the 3D structural information resolved for such regions. Hence, future efforts to solve full-length RdRP structures containing these regions and to dissect the functional contribution of them are necessary to improve the overall understanding of the RdRP proteins as an evolutionarily integrated group, and our analyses here may serve as a guideline for selecting representative RdRP systems in these studies.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Hengxia; Gong, Peng","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d57066fb6b0be503b07e3d19f20166d06af60b18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6713929.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507560/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01945","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Virus Taxonomy"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RdRP catalytic module","RdRP palm","RdRP proteins","RdRP catalytic motifs","viral RdRP","RdRP global structure","RdRP N-terminus","RdRP-structure available virus families","full-length RdRP structures","representative RdRP systems","additional regions","additional functional regions","RdRP-sequence available virus families","RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","residue catalytic module","positive-strand RNA viruses","polymerase catalytic motifs","RdRPs","functional information","Virus Taxonomy","functional contribution","large number of virus families","fingers domains","D structural information","C-terminal boundaries","thumb domains","unique class of nucleic acid polymerases","International Committee","high level of diversity","Flaviviridae family","encircled human right hand architecture","ICTV","b collection","reference points","regulatory mechanism","guideline","integrated group","overall understanding","future efforts","literature","conserved parts","hallmark residues","analyses","total","turn","specificity","studies","current knowledge","representatives","catalysis","review"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a study in which all patients were allocated to receive these two flow rates. The primary outcome was admitted as treatment failure, which was defined as a clinical escalation in respiratory status. Secondary outcomes covered a decrease of respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), the clinical respiratory score (CRS), rise of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and rates of weaning, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty\u2010eight cases (88 received the 1\u2010L flow rate and 80, the 2\u2010L flow rate) were included in the analyses.

Pathogen RNA can be detected by retinoic\u2010acid inducible gene I\u2010like receptors in the cytosol, whereas cytosolic DNA is recognized by DNA sensors such as cyclic GMP\u2010AMP synthase (cGAS). The resulting local immune response, which is initiated within hours of infection, is able to eliminate many pathogens before they are able to establish an infection in the host. For this reason, all viruses, and some intracellular bacteria and protozoa, need to evade detection by nucleic acid sensors. Immune evasion strategies include the sequestration and modification of nucleic acids, and the inhibition or degradation of host factors involved in innate immune signalling. Large DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, often use multiple viral proteins to inhibit signalling cascades at several different points; for instance herpes simplex virus 1 targets both DNA sensors cGAS and interferon\u2010\u03B3\u2010inducible protein 16, as well as the adaptor protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and other signalling factors in the pathway. Viruses with a small genome encode only a few immunomodulatory proteins, but these are often multifunctional, such as the NS1 protein from influenza A virus, which inhibits RNA sensing in multiple ways. Intracellular bacteria and protozoa can also be detected by nucleic acid sensors. However, as the type I interferon response is not always beneficial for the host under these circumstances, some bacteria subvert, rather than evade, these signalling cascades for their own gain.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Unterholzner, Leonie; Almine, Jessica F.","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d572b31e29c16909825aa14dc9e462020d95303.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6376273.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30499584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Intracellular DNA","DNA sensors cGAS","RNA sensors","nucleic acid sensors","intracellular bacteria","Large DNA viruses","innate immune signalling","interferon response","cytosolic DNA","signalling factors","innate immune response","signalling cascades","intracellular pathogens","inducible protein","resulting local immune response","degradation of host factors","NS1 protein","Immune evasion strategies","RNA sensing","acid inducible gene","Pathogen RNA","protozoa","stimulator of interferon genes","multiple viral proteins","adaptor protein STING","modification of nucleic acids","immunomodulatory proteins","secretion of type","multiple ways","hours of infection","instance herpes simplex virus","targets","different points","cytokines","sequestration","cyclic GMP","herpesviruses","chemokines","interferons","receptors","inhibition","AMP synthase","small genome","influenza","detection","infected cells","circumstances","gain","pathway","reason"],"language":"en"},

The pre-defined inclusion criteria were age of 3-35 months and first or second wheezing episode. Analysis was adjusted for baseline differences. Asymptomatic children with comparable demographics (n = 11) served as controls for RV-group. RESULTS: RV-group was older and had more atopic characteristics than RSV-group. At acute phase, RV-group had higher (fold change) IL-13 (39-fold), IL-12 (7.5-fold), IFN-gamma (6.0-fold) and IL-5 (2.8-fold) concentrations than RSV-group and higher IFN-gamma (27-fold), IL-2 (8.9-fold), IL-5 (5.6-fold) and IL-10 (2.6-fold) than the controls. 2-3 weeks later, RV-group had higher IFN-gamma (\u003E100-fold), IL-13 (33-fold) and IL-10 (6.5-fold) concentrations than RSV-group and higher IFN-gamma (15-fold) and IL-2 (9.4-fold) than the controls. IL-10 levels were higher in acute phase compared to convalescence phase in both infections (p \u003C 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results support a hypothesis that RV is likely to trigger wheezing mainly in children with a predisposition. IL-10 may have important regulatory function in acute viral wheeze.","publish_time":"2009-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jartti, Tuomas; Paul-Anttila, Maria; Lehtinen, Pasi; Parikka, Vilhelmiina; Vuorinen, Tytti; Simell, Olli; Ruuskanen, Olli","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/440d21b4ace84f1558ce12b4b684e5248cd2d40e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2762974.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19781072/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-85","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV-group","fold change","RSV-group","higher IFN-gamma","acute phase","early wheezing","T-regulatory","hospitalized wheezing children","wheezing episode","controls","convalescence phase serum samples of sole RV","cell type cytokine responses","T-helper","Systemic Th","immune responses","acute viral wheeze","Asymptomatic children","concentrations","RESULTS","important regulatory function","independent risk factor","age","respiratory syncytial virus","atopic characteristics","pre-defined inclusion criteria","comparable demographics","hypothesis","Rhinovirus","levels","comparative data","asthma","months","infections","interferon","interleukin","Analysis","baseline differences","CONCLUSION","diseases","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","predisposition","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Several recognized respiratory viral agents have a neuroinvasive capacity since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases. Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals. Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds. However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The respiratory involvement of HCoV has been clearly established since the 1960s. In addition, for almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic and could induce an overactivation of the immune system, in part by participating in the activation of autoreactive immune cells that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. Furthermore, it was shown that in the murine CNS, neurons are the main target of infection, which causes these essential cells to undergo degeneration and eventually die by some form of programmed cell death after virus infection. Moreover, it appears that the viral surface glycoprotein (S) represents an important factor in the neurodegenerative process. Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these recognized human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurological diseases for which the etiology remains unknown or poorly understood.","publish_time":"2014-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desforges, Marc; Le Coupanec, Alain; Brison, \u00C9lodie; Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Talbot, Pierre J.","journal":"Infectious Diseases and Nanomedicine I","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/380de4234933acbebfc25ba9d91f5dc147cd2f66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121612.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-81-322-1777-0_6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower respiratory tract","upper respiratory tract","respiratory involvement of HCoV","respiratory distress syndrome","recognized human respiratory pathogens","various respiratory viruses","recognized respiratory viral agents","severe acute respiratory syndrome","infection of CNS cells","Human Coronaviruses","immune system","important pathogens of humans","virus infection","viral infections","murine CNS","essential cells","activation of autoreactive immune cells","immune-compromised individuals","main target of infection","long-term neurological diseases","viral surface glycoprotein","exacerbation of neurological diseases","human health problems","important factor","neuroinvasive capacity","susceptible individuals","central nervous system","leading cause of morbidity","encephalitis","pneumonia","exacerbations of asthma","form of programmed cell death","elderly","neurons","neurotropism","newborns","infants","triggering","SARS","decades","neurodegenerative process","mortality","scientific literature","degeneration","etiology","autoimmunity","overactivation","animals","vulnerable populations","common colds","addition","properties"],"language":"en"},

How to maintain safety? What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical or biotransformation means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, while changes can also be harmful. The first-line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four-risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system (GHS) of classification and labeling is generally agreed by the world bodies. The hazards are divided into three categories\u2014physical, health, and environmental hazards. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safe guard processes and facility, one needs to first identify the threat, or screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high-activation energy, combustion leads to large-temperature dependence. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) The accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) Leakage of \u201Csignificant amount\u201D of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to atmosphere or environment; or (3) Reactor runaway.

Assessing the impact of infection on children and the community is required to guide immunisation policies. OBJECTIVES: To describe the impact of laboratory\u2010proven influenza in young children and to compare its impact with that of other respiratory viruses on the child, their family and the health care system. METHODS: Preschool children presenting for care or admission to a tertiary paediatric hospital during the 2008\u20102014 influenza seasons were tested for respiratory virus by polymerase chain reaction and culture. Parental surveys were used to determine the impact of infection on illness duration, medication use, absenteeism and health service utilisation. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the impact of influenza and to evaluate the association between influenza status and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 1191 children assessed, 238 had influenza. Among children with influenza, 87.8% were administered antipyretics and 40.9% antibiotics. 28.6% had secondary complications. 65.4% of children missed school/day care, and 53.4% of parents missed work. When influenza and other viruses were compared, significant differences were noted including duration of illness (influenza: 9.54 days, other viruses: 8.50 days; P = 0.005) and duration of absenteeism for both the child (23.1 vs 17.3 hours; P = 0.015) and their parents (28.5 vs 22.7 hours; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza infection in young children has a significant impact on medication use, absenteeism and the use of health care service. Significant differences are identified when compared with other ILI. These data demonstrate that influenza prevention strategies including immunisation are likely to have wide and significant impacts.","publish_time":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Willis, Gabriela A.; Preen, David B.; Richmond, Peter C.; Jacoby, Peter; Effler, Paul V.; Smith, David W.; Robins, Christine; Borland, Meredith L.; Levy, Avram; Keil, Anthony D.; Blyth, Christopher C.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49fee1986467f0cff2bc3517dbc1570e52d069d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6304317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137663/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12604","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of influenza","Influenza infection","proven influenza","influenza status","influenza seasons","young children","impact of infection","Preschool children","influenza prevention strategies","impact of laboratory","use of health care service","duration of absenteeism","illness duration","duration of illness","respiratory viruses","significant differences","health care system","medication use","day care","significant impacts","major cause of respiratory illness","health service utilisation","days","vs","hours","parents","immunisation policies","admission","polymerase chain reaction","family","culture","tertiary paediatric hospital","community","association","CONCLUSIONS","outcomes","data","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Multivariate regression analyses","antipyretics","Parental surveys","secondary complications","antibiotics","work","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here we are making available a public repository, for research investigators for interpretation, a collection of transcriptome datasets obtained from human whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to investigate the transcriptional responses following viral respiratory tract infection or vaccination against respiratory viruses. In total, Thirty one31 datasets, associated to viral respiratory tract infections and their related vaccination studies, were identified and retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and loaded in a custom web application designed for interactive query and visualization of integrated large-scale data. Quality control checks, using relevant biological markers, were performed. Multiple sample groupings and rank lists were created to facilitate dataset query and interpretation. Via this interface, users can generate web links to customized graphical views, which may be subsequently inserted into manuscripts to report novel findings. The GXB tool enables browsing of a single gene across projects, providing new perspectives on the role of a given molecule across biological systems in the diagnostic and prognostic following VRTI but also in identifying new correlates of protection.

In all these countries, buffaloes represent only a very small portion of total livestock, except in Egypt, where buffaloes are more numerous than cattle.

Several critical steps of vaccine manufacture involve a potential risk of viral contamination. Viruses, as extraneous, agents can be divided into two main groups. Group 1 agents, such as Pestivirus, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) are well-known to manufacturers and authorities. Compendial detection methods, clear guidelines and legislation have been established to minimise the risk of contamination with these agents. Contrary to group 1, group 2 agents like Torque Teno virus (TTV) or RD114, a replication-competent feline \u03B3-retrovirus, have only recently been recognised and their role as contaminants needs further investigation. Randomly selected veterinary vaccines used between 1992 and 2009 were tested by nucleic acid amplification for CAV, EDSV, and TTV. Pestivirus contamination was examined in 33 vaccines used between 1996 and 2006 and a further 27 vaccines used between 2007 and 2009 based on random selection of these vaccines. In addition to random tests done on vaccines used from 2007 on, 12 batches of live Aujeszky\u0027s disease vaccines submitted to our laboratory for Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) were also tested for Pestivirus.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kulcsar, Gabor; Farsang, Attila; Soos, T.","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/695c98c88802f05a1fe080f1f50ba04b1d6511f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129912.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105610000084; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2010.01.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105610000084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20338783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group","Pestivirus","CAV","TTV","Official Control Authority"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extraneous agents","safety of veterinary vaccines","Pestivirus contamination","risk of contamination","batches of live Aujeszky\u0027s disease vaccines","CAV","EDSV","TTV","viruses","potential risk of viral contamination","Torque Teno virus","chicken anaemia virus","egg drop syndrome virus","random tests","random selection","laboratory","Official Control Authority Batch Release","OCABR","RD114","clear guidelines","bacteria","mycoplasma","replication-competent feline \u03B3-retrovirus","Compendial detection methods","critical steps of vaccine manufacture","legislation","nucleic acid amplification","paramount importance","manufacturers","Chlamydia","addition","role","contaminants","investigation","authorities","main groups"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral infections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients with symptomatic lower- and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and lung histology were analyzed. RESULTS Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p \u003C 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral infections (n = 35) as compared with stable controls (n = 32). Mice immunized with exosomes from recipients with respiratory viral infections developed immune responses to self-antigens, fibrosis, small airway occlusion, and significant cellular infiltration; mice immunized with exosomes from controls did not (p \u003C 0.05).

Several of them have caused diseases in humans and domestic animals by interspecies transmission. Considering the diversity of bat coronaviruses, bat species and populations, we expect to discover more bat CoVs through virus surveillance. In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features. Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. All the putative genes were further confirmed by reverse-transcription analyses. One unique gene at the 3\u2019 end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus. Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-\u03B2 production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-\u03BAB production. We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to find any fully permissive cells. Our results expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses. Continuous screening of bat viruses will help us further understand the important role played by bats in coronavirus evolution and transmission.","publish_time":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ning; Luo, Chuming; Liu, Haizhou; Yang, Xinglou; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Wei; Li, Bei; Zhu, Yan; Zhu, Guangjian; Shen, Xurui; Peng, Cheng; Shi, Zhengli","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee14de143337eec0e9708f8139bfac2b7b8fdd27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6521148.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11040379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BtCoV/Rh"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spike gene","unique gene","bat CoVs","bat species","Bats","envelope gene","ORF8 gene","nucleocapsid gene","genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses","YN2012 genome","BtCoV","variety of coronaviruses","Continuous screening of bat viruses","unique genome features","Unique accessory genes","spike-mediated virus entry","ORF4a protein","spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system","coronavirus evolution","interspecies transmission","virus surveillance","putative genes","IFN-\u03B2 production","SARS-related coronavirus","NF-\u03BAB production","ORF7a","ORF3a","exhibits","ORF4b","amino acid identity","humans","domestic animals","ORF9","new member of alphaCoV","knowledge","end","populations","Functional analysis","natural reservoir","important role","diseases","reverse-transcription analyses","study","results","permissive cells"],"language":"en"},

Re-infection with HMPV is common, and currently there is no available vaccine against HMPV infection. Two genotypes of HMPV have been identified, A and B, both of which can be divided further into at least two distinct sub-genotypes. Here we report the results of the first study to investigate the genetic variability of HMPV strains circulating within Cambodia. The overall incidence of HMPV infection amongst an all-ages population of patients hospitalised with ALRI in Cambodia during 3 consecutive years, between 2007 and 2009, was 1.7%. The incidence of HMPV infection was highest amongst children less than 5 years of age, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most frequent clinical diagnoses across all age groups. The incidence of HMPV infection varied annually. As anticipated, genetic diversity was low amongst the conserved F gene sequences but very high amongst G gene sequences, some strains sharing as little as 56.3% and 34.2% homology at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively.

Two groups (A and B), each comprising three dogs, were inoculated with G. duodenalis trophozoites and cysts, respectively. A third group of two dogs was not inoculated and remained as control. After inoculation feces were collected daily to determine the pre-patent period, by flotation in 33% zinc sulfate solution. Blood samples (5mL) were collected from animals at 15-day intervals during the 165 days of the experimental period and were used to carry out the hemogram and biochemical evaluation of the levels of total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, urea and creatinine. A prepatent period was observed at 5\u20136 days post-inoculation (p.i.) in the inoculated dogs, with cysts eliminated for approximately 3 months. No alterations were seen in the clinical parameters evaluated. Anemia was observed at 15 p.i. in the inoculated dogs. The mean eosinophil count of inoculated groups was higher than that of the control (p \u22640.05) but none of the biochemical parameters analyzed presented significant differences.

It can specifically target the nucleolus to facilitate viral transcription and translation. As RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated transcription is active in the nucleolus, we investigated the role of Pol I, along with relative contributions of the human Pol II and Pol III, to early phases of viral transcription in HCMV infected cells, compared with Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Inhibition of Pol I with siRNA or the Pol I inhibitors CX-5461 or Actinomycin D (5nM) resulted in significantly decreased IE and pp65 mRNA and protein levels in human fibroblasts at early times post infection. This initially delayed replication was compensated for later during the replication process, at which stage it didn\u2019t significantly affect virus production.

In contrast, inhibition of Pol I failed to affect MCMV transcription.

Results 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes. Rhinovirus/enterovirus had the highest prevalence (41.5%), followed by influenza (15.8%), adenovirus (9.8%), parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (both 9.7%), coronavirus (5.6%), human metapneumovirus (5.5%) and human bocavirus (HBov) (2.0%).

The present review will be focused on recent structural and protein-protein interaction information involving two viroporins found in enveloped viruses that target the respiratory tract; (i) the envelope protein in coronaviruses and (ii) the small hydrophobic protein in paramyxoviruses. Deletion of these two viroporins leads to viral attenuation in vivo, whereas data from cell culture shows involvement in the regulation of stress and inflammation. The channel activity and structure of some representative members of these viroporins have been recently characterized in some detail. In addition, searches for protein-protein interactions using yeast-two hybrid techniques have shed light on possible functional roles for their exposed cytoplasmic domains. A deeper analysis of these interactions should not only provide a more complete overview of the multiple functions of these viroporins, but also suggest novel strategies that target protein-protein interactions as much needed antivirals. These should complement current efforts to block viroporin channel activity.","publish_time":"2015-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres, Jaume; Surya, Wahyu; Li, Yan; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2b0f19c4b1270624987ede418ab8da1e8b55cdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4488717.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26053927/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7062750","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein-protein interactions","Viroporins","protein-protein interaction information","envelope protein","small hydrophobic protein","viroporin channel activity","growing family of channel","small polypeptides","representative members","enveloped viruses","possible functional roles","hybrid techniques","involvement","data","light","yeast","exposed cytoplasmic domains","cell culture","novel strategies","regulation of stress","multiple functions","current efforts","structure","searches","respiratory tract","viral attenuation","needed antivirals","complete overview","coronaviruses","paramyxoviruses","addition","present review","inflammation","deeper analysis","Deletion"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology, seasonality, and risk factors for influenza are well defined in most of the temperate countries, but estimating influenza burden in the World Health Organization (WHO) Region for the Eastern Mediterranean is scarce. In Oman, despite the advancements in influenza surveillance, the clinical burden and seasonality of influenza remain not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence of influenza\u2010associated hospitalizations and in\u2010hospital death in Oman. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Influenza\u2010associated hospitalizations and in\u2010hospital deaths were estimated using hospital discharge records based on ICD\u201010 codes (J09\u2010J18), results of virological analysis and population census for the period between 2012 and 2015. RESULTS: During 2012 and 2015, we identified a total of 19 405 influenza\u2010associated hospitalization and 847 deaths. Influenza positivity percentage ranged from 6.4% in 2013 to 20.6% in 2015. Influenza\u2010associated hospitalization incidence rate was 7.3 (95% CI: 6.4\u20108.1) per 100 000 in 2013 and 27.5 (95% CI: 25.9\u201029.1) per 100 000 in 2015 with an overall rate of 20.6 (95% CI: 19.9\u201021.3) per 100 000.

Compared to most methods used in previous studies, the GFI model possesses the advantage of eliminating decomposition residuals, which enables it to display better decomposition characteristics (Ang et al., 2004).

The cumulative contribution of economic growth to transportation carbon emissions reaches 334.5%. (ii) The negative drivers are the transportation intensity and energy structure, while the transportation intensity is the main factor that restrains transportation carbon emissions. The energy structure displays a certain inhibition effect, but its inhibition is not obvious.

However, peracetic acid is an environmental toxin. Therefore, safer, alternative disinfectants or disinfectant systems should be developed. Because photodynamic virus inactivation with methylene blue (MB)/light system has proven effective in blood banking, MB was selected as a photosensitizing agent, dengue virus as a model virus for enveloped RNA viruses, and an in-house fabricated narrow bandwidth light system overlapping the absorption spectrum of MB as the light source. Dengue virus was mixed with different concentrations of MB, and illuminated by the narrow bandwidth light system under different illumination distances and times. The amount of dengue virus remaining was evaluated by plaque forming assays. Results showed that the concentration of MB working solution, illumination intensity of light source, illumination distance and time were four key factors affecting efficiency of virus inactivation using the MB/narrow bandwidth light system. Dengue virus could be completely inactivated at 2.5 m in 5 min when MB\u2A7E1.0 \u03BCg/ml. However, when the distance reached 3.0 m, only greater concentrations of MB (2.0 \u03BCg/ml) could completely inactivate virus in a reasonably short time (20 min), and smaller concentrations of MB (1.0 \u03BCg/ml) could only completely inactivate virus using longer times (25 min). The results of this virus inactivation model indicate that our MB/narrow bandwidth light system provides a powerful, easy way to inactivate dengue viruses.","publish_time":"2004-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Qing; Fu, Wei-Ling; Chen, Bing; Huang, Jun-Fu; Zhang, Xue; Xue, Qiang","journal":"Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6b7f9095c644284c7686ed30d01f70ec1c887e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129913.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1011134404001186; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1011134404001186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model virus","concentration of MB","virus inactivation model","different concentrations of MB","efficiency of virus inactivation","greater concentrations of MB","photodynamic virus inactivation","smaller concentrations of MB","absorption spectrum of MB","in-house fabricated narrow bandwidth light system","dengue viruses","illumination intensity of light source","\u03BCg","different illumination distances","Results","Abstract Peracetic acid","alternative disinfectants","used disinfectants","longer times","enveloped RNA viruses","reasonably short time","key factors","methylene blue","solid surfaces","hospitals","solution","easy way","blood banking","photosensitizing agent","public places","disinfectant systems","environmental toxin","plaque","assays"],"language":"en"},

The preparation of a sample is known to have an effect on the representation of virus sequences within the metagenomic dataset yet comparatively little attention has been given to this. Physical enrichment techniques are often applied to samples to increase the number of viral sequences and therefore enhance the probability of detection. With the exception of virus ecology studies, there is a paucity of information available to researchers on the type of sample preparation required for a viral metagenomic study that seeks to identify an aetiological virus in an animal or human diagnostic sample. A review of published virus discovery studies revealed the most commonly used enrichment methods, that were usually quick and simple to implement, namely low-speed centrifugation, filtration, nuclease-treatment (or combinations of these) which have been routinely used but often without justification. These were applied to a simple and well-characterised artificial sample composed of bacterial and human cells, as well as DNA (adenovirus) and RNA viruses (influenza A and human enterovirus), being either non-enveloped capsid or enveloped viruses. The effect of the enrichment method was assessed by both quantitative real-time PCR and metagenomic analysis that incorporated an amplification step. Reductions in the absolute quantities of bacteria and human cells were observed for each method as determined by qPCR, but the relative abundance of viral sequences in the metagenomic dataset remained largely unchanged. A 3-step method of centrifugation, filtration and nuclease-treatment showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral sequences. This study provides a starting point for the selection of a purification method in future virus discovery studies, and highlights the need for more data to validate the effect of enrichment methods on different sample types, amplification, bioinformatics approaches and sequencing platforms. This study also highlights the potential risks that may attend selection of a virus enrichment method without any consideration for the sample type being investigated.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hall, Richard J.; Wang, Jing; Todd, Angela K.; Bissielo, Ange B.; Yen, Seiha; Strydom, Hugo; Moore, Nicole E.; Ren, Xiaoyun; Huang, Q.

Ascending bacterial infection is a common cause of stillbirth, but prevention has proven elusive. Many viral infections are causal for stillbirth but aside from vaccination for common childhood diseases, it is unclear how most viral-caused stillbirths may be prevented. Malaria, because of its high prevalence and extensive placental damage accounts for large numbers of stillbirths. Intermittent malarial prophylaxis and insecticide impregnated bed nets should decrease stillbirths. Many animal and vector-borne infections cause stillbirth.

Turkey poults were orally inoculated with TCV at 10 days of age. Intestinal segment cultures were administered for duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the IgA antibody responses were analyzed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9 weeks post-infection (PI) in two different experiments. The kinetics of virus-specific IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were similar: gradually increased from 1 week PI, reached the peak at 3 or 4 weeks PI, and declined afterward. The virus-specific IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum showed negative correlation with duration of TCV antigen in the corresponding locations of intestine with Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient of \u22120.85 (p=0.034), \u22120.74 (p=0.096), and \u22120.75 (p=0.084), respectively. Moreover, the virus-specific IgA antibody responses in serum were positively correlated with that of duodenum (coefficient=0.829,p=0.042), jejunum (coefficient=0.829,p=0.042), and ileum (coefficient=0.771,p=0.072) segment cultures, suggesting that the induction of specific IgA response in serum was predictive of an IgA response in intestine. The results indicate that intestinal mucosal IgA antibodies to TCV are elicited in turkeys following infection with TCV. The local mucosal antibodies may provide protective immunity for infected turkeys to recover from TCV infection.","publish_time":"2002-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loa, C. C; Lin, T. L; Wu, C.

It causes severe viral pneumonia and is associated with a high fatality rate. However, the pathogenesis, comparative pathology and inflammatory cell response of rhesus macaques and common marmosets experimentally infected with MERS-CoV are unknown. We describe the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings from rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV infection. The main histopathological findings in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were varying degrees of pulmonary lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, haemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis of the pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The characteristic inflammatory cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. Based on these observations, the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets appeared to develop chronic and acute pneumonia, respectively. MERS-CoV antigens and viral RNA were identified in type I and II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and ultrastructural observations showed that viral protein was found in type II pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in both species. Correspondingly, the entry receptor DDP4 was found in type I and II pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages. The rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV can be used as a tool to mimic the oncome of MERS-CoV infections in humans. These models can help to provide a better understanding of the pathogenic process of this virus and to develop effective medications and prophylactic treatments.","publish_time":"2017-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Pin; Xu, Yanfeng; Deng, Wei; Bao, Linlin; Huang, Lan; Xu, Yuhuan; Yao, Yanfeng; Qin, Chuan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f09116d82b287cf3731d3baacc75895e7999203.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5325479.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28234937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["common marmosets","lungs of rhesus macaques","MERS-CoV antigens","pneumocytes","common marmoset animal models of MERS","bronchial epithelial cells","oncome of MERS","CoV infections","inflammatory cell response of rhesus macaques","characteristic inflammatory cells","type","inflammatory cell infiltration","severe viral pneumonia","ultrastructural findings","ultrastructural observations","alveolar macrophages","viral protein","viral RNA","acute pneumonia","main histopathological findings","pulmonary oedema","varying degrees of pulmonary lesions","necrosis","comparative pathology","haemorrhage","degeneration","eosinophils","effective medications","pathogenic process","Middle East respiratory syndrome","pathogenesis","immunohistochemical","better understanding","prophylactic treatments","entry receptor DDP4","neutrophils","tool","humans","species","high fatality rate","discovered coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Convalescent plasma (500 mL) was obtained from each of three SARS patients and transfused into the three infected HCW. Donors were blood type O and seronegative for hepatitis B and C, HIV, syphilis and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II). Serum antibody (IgG) titre was \u003E640. Apharesis was performed with a CS 3000 plus cell separator followed by the forming of the convalescent phase plasma. As part of the routine check with donated plasma, the convalescent plasma was confirmed free of residual SARS-CoV by RT\u2013PCR. Serial serum samples obtained from the recipients of the convalescent plasma were collected to undertake real-time quantitative RT\u2013PCR for SARS-CoV for direct measurement of viral concentration. Specific immunoglobulin IgM and IgG concentrations were titrated using an antigen microarray developed in-house. Results: Viral load dropped from 495 \u00D7 10(3), 76 \u00D7 10(3) or 650 \u00D7 10(3) copies/mL to zero or 1 copy/mL one day after transfusion. Anti-SARS-CoV IgM and IgG also increased in a time-dependent manner following transfusion. All three patients survived. One HCW became pregnant subsequently, delivering 13 months after discharge. Positive anti-SARS-CoV IgG was detected in the newborn. Passive transfer of anti-SARS-CoV antibody from the mother was considered as a possibility.

Thus, viral infections that result in neuronal depletion, either by viral lysis or by induction of the cytolytic immune response, would likely lead to profound neurologic impairment. However, many viral infections that result in tissue destruction elsewhere in the host produce few overt symptoms in the CNS, despite readily detectable virus expression. This observation has lead to the speculation that neurons possess strategies to limit the replication and spread of otherwise cytopathic viruses. These strategies either favor the clearance of virus in the absence of appreciable neuronal loss or promote the establishment of noncytolytic persistent infections.

Results from three different experimental conditions revealed high stability of TBP compared with the other HKGs profiled across the samples assayed.

Therefore, we recommend the TBP as a suitable HKG for efficient normalization among treatments, tissues, and developmental stages of A. glycines.

In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.","publish_time":"1988-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keller, F.; Schmitt, C.; Kirn, A.","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35ac0051e5ac088a9d24c3cc287df3c6d5cc4b90.json; document_parses/pdf_json/376b0826b37e15e6354109d816603d47a90cb55e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzI1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of Kupffer cells","stimulated Kupffer cells","LPS-treated Kupffer cells","strains of mice","supernatants of infected Kupffer cells","Kupffer cellsof","infected mice","course of MHV","pathogenesis of MHV","J resistant mice","sensitive mice","liver sinusoidal cells","determined sensitivity of mice","induced hepatitis","viral replication","infection","hepatitis virus","genetic sensitivity of mouse strains","delay of virus replication","antiviral activity","potential mechanisms","direct viral injury","synthesis of different amounts of IL","interaction of lipopolysaccharide","double role","antigen-proceesing function","dramatic inhibition","effects of indomethacin treatment","dose-dependent interleukin","histochemical studies","operation","efficiency","immunocompetent lymphocytes","striking differences","data","results","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Based on a previous study, 2 genetically diverse commercial lines of pigs that also were divergent in the susceptibility of monocyte-derived macrophages to PRRSV infection in vitro were selected for an in vivo challenge study. Based on the average percentage of infected macrophages for each line, a line derived from the Large White breed was characterized as fluorescence-activated cell sorting(hi) (FACS(hi)), and a line derived from Duroc and Pietrain breeds was characterized as FACS(lo). Pigs from each line were challenged at 6 wk of age with PRRSV VR-2385 and necropsied at 10 or 21 d after infection. Data collected included clinical evaluation of disease, virus titration in serum and lung lavage fluid, macroscopic lung lesion scores, and microscopic lung lesion scores. The FACS(lo) line had consistently more severe clinical disease compared with the FACS(hi) line in the early stages of infection. Differences between line means were significant (P \u003C 0.05) at 10 d after infection for all variables just described, and the FACS(lo) line showed more severe signs of disease. By 21 d after infection, clinical signs and lesions were resolving, and the differences between lines were significant (P \u003C 0.04) only for microscopic lung lesion scores but approached significance (P \u003C 0.08) for virus titer in serum. At 21 d after infection, the relationship between the lines reversed; the FACS(hi) line had higher serum virus titers than the FACS(lo) line. This report provides evidence that strongly suggests the existence of a host genetic component in disease susceptibility to PRRSV and indicates that further study is warranted to define the cellular mechanisms that affect disease susceptibility.","publish_time":"2006-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vincent, A.

We derive the theoretical effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size based on the edge-based compartmental theory. To validate the proposed theoretical predictions, extensive numerical experiments are implemented by using asynchronous and synchronous updating methods. When asynchronous updating method is used in simulations, recovery rate does not affect the final state of spreading dynamics. But with synchronous updating, we find that the effective epidemic threshold decreases with recovery rate, and final outbreak size increases with recovery rate. A good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the numerical results are observed on both synthetic and real-world networks.

Paramount to the care of affected patients is the delivery of lung-protective mechanical ventilation which prioritizes tidal volume and plateau pressure limitation. Lung protection can probably be further enhanced by scaling target tidal volumes to the specific respiratory mechanics of individual patients. The best procedure for selecting optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS remains uncertain; several relevant issues must be considered when selecting PEEP, particularly lung recruitability. Noninvasive ventilation must be used with caution in ARDS as excessively high respiratory drive can further exacerbate lung injury; newer modes of delivery offer promising approaches in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Airway pressure release ventilation offers an alternative approach to maximize lung recruitment and oxygenation, but clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit of this mode over conventional ventilation strategies. Rescue therapy with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is an important option in refractory hypoxemia. Despite a disappointing lack of benefit (and possible harm) in patients with moderate or severe ARDS, possibly due to lung hyperdistention and right ventricular dysfunction, high-frequency oscillation may improve outcome in patients with very severe hypoxemia.","publish_time":"2019-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sklar, Michael C.; Patel, Bhakti K.; Beitler, Jeremy R.; Piraino, Thomas; Goligher, Ewan C.","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9e4c542e98512f0f5b33e4608496247853da1c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117088.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117088/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Paramount","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delivery of lung","lung recruitment","Noninvasive ventilation","lung injury","lung hyperdistention","lung recruitability","Lung protection","high-frequency oscillatory ventilation","Mechanical ventilation practices","protective mechanical ventilation","severe ARDS","Airway pressure release ventilation","high respiratory drive","conventional ventilation strategies","specific respiratory mechanics of individual patients","care of affected patients","high-frequency oscillation","hypoxemic respiratory failure","PEEP","severe hypoxemia","acute respiratory distress syndrome","plateau pressure limitation","survival benefit","refractory hypoxemia","optimal positive end-expiratory pressure","newer modes of delivery","disappointing lack of benefit","scaling target tidal volumes","promising approaches","alternative approach","important option","ventricular dysfunction","outcome","possible harm","clinical trials","oxygenation","caution","Rescue therapy","best procedure","growing understanding","relevant issues","disease pathophysiology","Paramount"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) representing gene 9 (the gene encoding the neutralization antigens in VP7 glycoprotein) from OSU (porcine rotavirus serotype 1) and Gottfried (porcine rotavirus serotype 2) strains were used to determine the optimal hybridization conditions which allow specific detection of group A porcine rotaviruses. Probes were prepared by excision of the inserts from the recombinant plasmids and radiolabeling of cDNA with (32)P by the random primer extension method. Probes were hybridized at various stringencies with viral RNA from different rotavirus serotypes bound to nylon membranes. Hybridization at low stringency (26% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) had high sensitivity but low specificity. Hybridization at high stringency (16% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) produced high specificity but decreased the sensitivity observed at low stringency. Probes were specific for rotavirus at both stringencies and did not hybridize with nucleic acids from other porcine viruses. Subgenomic gene 9 fragments were then tested to provide more specific probes. A 322 bp fragment from OSU gene 9 between nucleotides 382 and 704 and a 266 bp fragment from Gottfried gene 9 between nucleotides 230 and 496 were found to be specific as hybridization probes. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of the dot blot hybridization assay using subgenomic fragments of gene 9 to detect and differentiate serotypes of porcine rotavirus.

Despite the uncertainties about the benefit to control or not the temperature, it could be stated that extreme temperature (hypo- or hyperthermia) should be avoided and that the benefit/risk of temperature control must be individually weighted.","publish_time":"2016-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seguin, P.; Launey, Y.; Nesseler, N.; Malledant, Y.","journal":"Reanimation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b4020e025421d93dbb1aaf0d6844a351238d952.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of temperature control","control strategy","extreme temperature","benefit","paracetamol","external cooling","severe sepsis","fever","means","internal cooling","septic patients","septic shock","ongoing infectious process","deleterious focal inflammatory process","recent noninterventional studies","antipyretic medications","experimental works","patient\u2019s outcome","regards","tissular ischemia","nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs","mains","clinical situations","safety","hypo","hyperthermia","intensive care","oxygen consumption","conclusive evidence","Methods","uncertainties","hand"],"language":"en"},

Administration of neuromuscular blocking agents in the acute phase of ARDS has been also shown to be beneficial on survival. In contrast, the exact place of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in ARDS management remains to be defined despite data suggesting its possible efficiency. In addition, a new era of research has emerged with the advent of cell therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells are able to both promote alveolar epithelium repair and prevent infections. Their efficacy in animal models of ARDS still needs to be confirmed by clinical trials.

Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 10(4) or 10(3) International Units (U) of rHuIFN-\u03B1 for 24 h significantly suppressed (P\u003C0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10\u201310(\u22123) U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 10(4)\u201310(2) U (P\u003C0.001) or 10 U (P\u003C0.05) of rHuIFN-\u03B1/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-(3)H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-\u03B1 doses of 10(4) U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-\u03B1 in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (10(6) U/kg), moderate dose (10(4) U/kg), or a relatively low dose (10(2) U/kg) of rHuIFN-\u03B1. Cats inoculated with 10(6) U ofrHuIFN-\u03B1/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 10(4) or 10(2) U of rHuIFN-\u03B1/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-\u03B1 given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weiss, R.C.; Oostrom-Ram, T.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119795/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Units","PBL","PWM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["U of rHuIFN","rHuIFN-\u03B1 doses","U ofrHuIFN-\u03B1","high doses of rHuIFN","dose-response effects of rHuIFN","blastogenic responses","mean PWM responses","free cats","inoculation of cats","Lower doses of IFN","induced blastogenesis","h postinoculation","incubation of PBL","moderate dose","low dose","individual groups of cats","mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis","suppression of certain T-cell responses","discernible effect","Cultures of PBL","cell viability","specific-pathogen","specific reductions","consecutive days","significant decrease","pokeweed mitogen","enhanced mitogenesis","effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha","direct cytotoxic effects","observed antiproliferative actions of IFN","Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes","preinoculation values","thymidine","methyl","synthesized cellular DNA","incorporation","range","International Units","contrast","absence","findings","immunoenhancing","concanavalin"],"language":"en"},

While the Y2H false positives can be efficiently reduced by using built-in controls, retesting, and evaluation of background activation; implementing the multiple variants of the Y2H vector systems is essential to reduce the false negatives and ensure comprehensive coverage of an interactome.","publish_time":"2015-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajagopala, Seesandra Venkatappa","journal":"Prokaryotic Systems Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea63b35ed120517fe86fc17fd75df8b73a0448fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120425.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Y2H screening strategies","Y2H false positives","array-based Y2H system","Y2H vector systems","comprehensive screening","cloning system","hybrid system","pooled library screening","multiple variants","multiple sampling","interactome studies of small genomes","cDNA libraries","large genomes","binary protein","protein interactions","comprehensive coverage","false negatives","defined libraries of open reading frames","resources","ORFs","existing ORFeome clones","retesting","evaluation of background activation","recombination","retests","powerful method","terms of time","built-in controls","yeast"],"language":"en"},

The characterization of newly emerging influenza viruses in terms of their potential to transmit in a mammalian host is furthermore an important part of pandemic risk assessment. For these reasons, a guinea pig model of influenza virus transmission was developed in 2006. The guinea pig provides an important alternative to preexisting models for influenza. Most influenza viruses do not readily transmit among mice. Ferrets, while highly relevant, are expensive and can be difficult to obtain in high numbers. Moreover, it is generally accepted that efforts to accurately model human disease are strengthened by the use of multiple animal species.

Thus, \u201Cjust in time\u201D expression is likely an important part of the mechanism that maintains the proper temporal order of cell cycle events.

Over the past 25 years, many studies have been undertaken to determine how gene expression is regulated during the cell cycle. In this review, we discuss contemporary models for the control of cell cycle-regulated transcription, and how this transcription program is coordinated with other cell cycle events in S. cerevisiae.

Excessive stimulation of complement amplification requires IgG-containing or F(ab\u2032)(2)-containing immune complexes (IC) that capture dimeric C3b on one of their heavy chains or heavy chain fragments. The ability of IgG-IC to capture dimeric C3b by the Fab portion is dependent on an affinity for C3 within the Fab portion, but outside the antigen-binding region. This property is rare among IgG NAbs. In contrast to this, the lack of the Fc portion renders the Fab regions of any F(ab\u2032)(2)-IC accessible to nascent C3b, but dimeric C3b deposits only if F(ab\u2032)(2)-IC form secondary IC with anti-hinge NAbs that rigidify the complex and thereby promote deposition of dimeric C3b.

In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible \u03BB pl promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.","publish_time":"1992-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trirawatanapong, Thaweesak; Chandran, Bala; Putnak, Robert; Padmanabhan, R.","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125935/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzgxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["3H5 mAb","length E polypeptides","3H5-binding site","authentic E protein","E protein of dengue virus type","various groups of surface aa residues","synthetic peptide","fine mapping","Envelope glycoprotein E of flaviviruses","PCR","linear sequence","monoclonal Ab","type-specific","neutralizing antibody","plaque reduction assay","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","heat-inducible \u03BB pl promoter","response","inframe","series of targeted deletions","Escherichia coli expression vector","polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera","location","polymerase chain reaction","regions","rabbit Abs","context","amino acids","protective immunity","Reactivities","method","host","addition","virion","hydrophilicity pattern","guide","report"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Sprague-Dawley rats, partial cystectomy (\u003E50%) was performed, followed by BAMG augmentation cystoplasty. After 4 months, organ bath studies of tissue strips in 10 were used to compare the contractility of the BAMG regenerates and the corresponding host detrusor smooth muscle. RESULTS: The BAMG regenerates exhibited contractile activity to electrical field stimulation and a qualitatively identical pattern of response to muscarinic, purinergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic drug administration and nitric oxide. At 4 months after surgery, the maximum forces of contraction of the BAMG regenerates to carbachol stimulation amounted to close to 80% of the host bladder response. With electrical field stimulation, they equaled 44% and 62% of the host bladder response after 2.5 and 4 months, respectively. Histological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of receptors for neurotransmitters that these functional in vitro studies implied.

We have expressed the B-subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin and the spike protein of swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus at high levels in corn, and demonstrate that these antigens delivered in the seed elicit protective immune responses.","publish_time":"2001-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Streatfield, Stephen J.; Jilka, Joseph M.; Hood, Elizabeth E.; Turner, Debra D.; Bailey, Michele R.; Mayor, Jocelyne M.; Woodard, Susan L.; Beifuss, Katherine K.; Horn, Michael E.; Delaney, Donna E.; Tizard, Ian R.; Howard, John A.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antigens"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["corn","seed","Antigens","protective immune responses","spike protein of swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin","increased safety","viral epitopes","economy","high levels","current vaccine technologies","ambient temperature","long distances","stability","benefits","B-subunit","subunits of bacterial toxins","versatility","vast quantities","global vaccination","Numerous studies","efficacy","recombinant proteins","transgenic plants"],"language":"en"},

However, the non-structural protein 3C protease (3Cpro) is essential for viral replication and is relatively highly conserved among serotypes, making it a potential target for diagnostic testing. The thin film biosensor is an assay platform that can be formatted into a sensitive immunoassay for viral proteins in clinical specimens. The technology utilizes an optically coated silicon surface to convert specific molecular binding events into visual color changes by altering the reflective properties of light through molecular thin films. Objective: To develop a rapid test for detection of HRV by developing broadly serotype reactive antibodies to 3Cpro and utilizing them in the thin film biosensor format. Study design: Polyclonal antibodies to 3Cpro were purified and incorporated into the thin film assay. The in vitro sensitivity, specificity and multiserotype cross-reactivity of the 3Cpro assay were tested. Nasal washes from naturally infected individuals were also tested to verify that 3Cpro was detectable in clinical specimens. Results: The 3Cpro assay is a 28-min, non-instrumented room temperature test with a visual limit of detection of 12 pM (picomolar) 3Cpro. In terms of viral titer, as few as 1000 TCID(50) equivalents of HRV2 were detectable. The assay detected 45/52 (87%) of the HRV serotypes tested but showed no cross-reactivity to common respiratory viruses or bacteria. The thin film assay detected 3Cpro in HRV-infected cell culture supernatants coincident with first appearance of cytopathic effect. Data are also presented demonstrating 3Cpro detection from clinical samples collected from HRV-infected individuals. The assay detected 3Cpro in expelled nasal secretions from a symptomatic individual on the first day of illness. In addition, 9/11 (82%) concentrated nasal wash specimens from HRV infected children were positive in the 3Cpro test. Conclusion: We have described a novel, sensitive thin film biosensor for rapid detection of HRV 3Cpro. This test may be suitable for the point of care setting, where rapid HRV diagnostic test results could contribute to clinical decisions regarding appropriate antibiotic or antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2001-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ostroff, Rachel; Ettinger, Anna; La, Helen; Rihanek, Marynette; Zalman, Leora; Meador, James; Patick, Amy K; Worland, Steve; Polisky, Barry","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128216.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzkyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cpro assay","Cpro detection","Cpro test","film assay","HRV serotypes","rapid detection of HRV","HRV-infected individuals","HRV infected children","rapid HRV diagnostic test results","rapid test","assay platform","clinical specimens","film biosensor format","HRV-infected cell culture supernatants coincident","visual limit of detection","clinical decisions","clinical samples","nasal wash specimens","Nasal washes","viral proteins","viral replication","detection of surface exposed capsid antigens impractical","non-instrumented room temperature test","multiserotype cross-reactivity","expelled nasal secretions","terms of viral titer","sensitive immunoassay","diagnostic testing","distinct serotypes of human rhinoviruses","Polyclonal antibodies","reactive antibodies","visual color changes","coated silicon surface","specific molecular binding events","point of care setting","symptomatic individual","reflective properties of light","appropriate antibiotic","common respiratory viruses","antiviral therapy","C protease","appearance of cytopathic effect","bacteria","specificity","potential target","novel","non-structural protein","Study design","TCID","equivalents of HRV2","sensitivity","films","technology","picomolar","day of illness","Objective","Conclusion","Background","Data","addition"],"language":"en"},

Among system L transporters, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is responsible for the nutrient uptake in cancer cells, whereas L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2) is a transporter for non-cancer cells. In this study, we have established HEK293 cell lines stably expressing high levels of human LAT1 and LAT2 forming heterodimers with native human 4F2hc of the cells. We have found that l-[(14)C]alanine is an appropriate substrate to examine the function of LAT2, whereas l-[(14)C]leucine is used for LAT1. By using l-[(14)C]alanine on LAT2, we have for the first time directly evaluated the function of human LAT2 expressed in mammalian cells and obtained its reliable kinetics. Using \u03B1-alkyl amino acids including \u03B1-methyl-alanine and \u03B1-ethyl-l-alanine, we have demonstrated that \u03B1-alkyl groups interfere with the interaction with LAT2. These cell lines with higher practical advantages would be useful for screening and analyzing compounds to develop LAT1-specific drugs that can be used for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The strategy that we took to establish the cell lines would also be applicable to the other heterodimeric transporters with important therapeutic implications.","publish_time":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khunweeraphong, Narakorn; Nagamori, Shushi; Wiriyasermkul, Pattama; Nishinaka, Yumiko; Wongthai, Printip; Ohgaki, Ryuichi; Tanaka, Hidekazu; Tominaga, Hideyuki; Sakurai, Hiroyuki; Kanai, Yoshikatsu","journal":"J Pharmacol Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozk1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of LAT2","alanine","function of human LAT2","\u03B1-alkyl amino acids","type amino acid transporter","non-cancer cells","\u03B1-methyl","\u03B1-ethyl","mammalian cells","\u03B1-alkyl groups","HEK293 cell lines","high levels of human LAT1","cellular uptake of neutral amino acids","LAT1-specific drugs","cancer diagnosis","native human 4F2hc","major transport system","nutrient uptake","heterodimeric transporters","heterodimers","higher practical advantages","compounds","screening","appropriate substrate","important therapeutic implications","reliable kinetics","interaction","therapeutics","study","time","leucine","strategy"],"language":"en"},

MEFs with culturable pathogenic bacteria contained more interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2 (median: 110 \u03BCg/L vs. \u003C7.5 \u03BCg/L), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (6.3 \u03BCg/L vs. \u003C2.5 \u03BCg/L), IL-8 (410 \u03BCg/L vs. 38 \u03BCg/L) and IL-10 (0.48 \u03BCg/L vs. \u003C0.30 \u03BCg/L) than culture-negative fluids, irrespective of PCR findings. IL-6 and PGE(2) were equally abundant (69\u2013110 \u03BCg/L) in effusions with live, dead or undetectable bacteria. Cytokine levels were unrelated to bacterial species and to the presence or absence of virus. Similar levels of TNF and IL-6 as found in the MEFs were obtained by in vitro stimulation of leukocytes, whereas 11 times more IL-1\u03B2 and 3.5 times more IL-8 were produced in vivo, and 22 times more IL-10 was produced in vitro. Vigorous production of proinflammatory cytokines accompanies AOM with membrane rupture, regardless of the causative agent, but the production seems to cease rapidly once the bacteria are killed and fragmented. IL-6 and PGE(2), however, remain after bacterial disintegration, and may play a role in the resolution phase.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skovbjerg, S.; Roos, K.; Nowrouzian, F.; Lindh, M.; Holm, S.E.; Adlerberth, I.; Olofsson, S.; Wold, A.E.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b50f24dd749c3eb02157478ce63572e5d00c8f00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozk3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","PGE","TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCg","dead bacteria","MEFs","Cytokine levels","undetectable bacteria","times","Gram-negative bacteria","PGE","culturable pathogenic bacteria","perforated AOM","middle ear fluids","membrane rupture","mediator levels","Human leukocytes","Similar levels of TNF","stimulation of leukocytes","cytokine pattern","culture-negative fluids","inflammatory response","presence of pathogens","bacterial species","tympanic membrane","PCR findings","bacterial disintegration","different patterns of inflammatory mediators","Vigorous production of proinflammatory cytokines","children","interleukin","responses","microbes","tumour necrosis factor","effusions","causative agent","Acute otitis media","role","prostaglandin E","median","absence of virus","resolution phase"],"language":"en"},

Beck-Speier et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2006;316:842\u2013851). In a follow up study, we hypothesized that OMZ generates pro-resolving lipoxins being paralleled by production of immune-modulating prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and anti-inflammatory 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE] and depletion of pro-inflammatory leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)). Human neutrophils (PMN) were chosen as the cellular system. The effect of OMZ on these parameters as well as on respiratory burst activity and oxidative stress marker 8-isprostane was analyzed in unstimulated and co-stimulated PMN by ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), respectively. In unstimulated cells, OMZ induced formation of PGE(2), 15(S)-HETE, and LXA(4). The levels of LTB(4) and 8-isoprostane were not affected, whereas respiratory burst activity was drastically inhibited. In UCP- and OZ-stimulated control cells, all parameters were elevated. Here, OMZ maintained the increased levels of PGE(2), 15(S)-HETE, and LXA(4), but substantially suppressed levels of LTB(4) and 8-isoprostane and inhibited the respiratory burst activity. These findings suggest a switch from the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid class LTB(4) to the pro-resolving LXA(4). Since LXA(4) is most relevant in returning inflamed tissue to homeostasis, OMZ is postulated to terminate rhinitis-related inflammation, thus contributing to shortening of disease duration.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beck-Speier, Ingrid; Oswald, Barbara; Maier, Konrad L.; Karg, Erwin; Ramseger, Ren\u00E9","journal":"J Pharmacol Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128694/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozk5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMZ","PGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of OMZ","levels of LTB","pro-resolving LXA","respiratory burst activity","HETE","OMZ induced formation of PGE","pro-inflammatory eicosanoid class LTB","pro-resolving lipoxins","increased levels of PGE","unstimulated cells","UCP","parameters","isoprostane","depletion of pro-inflammatory leukotriene B","co-stimulated PMN","stimulated control cells","oxidative stress marker","ultrafine carbon particles","Beck-Speier","production of immune","antiinflammatory properties","isprostane","switch","modulating prostaglandin E","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","inflamed tissue","homeostasis","nasal decongestant oxymetazoline","hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid","opsonized zymosan","rhinitis-related inflammation","Human neutrophils","findings","study","cellular system","disease duration","follow"],"language":"en"},

Norkurarinol, a lavandulylated flavanone, was isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity. Norkurarinol suppressed the NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 inducible secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity induced by poly(I:C), TLR3 ligand, in THP1-Blue-CD14 cells with IC(50) values of 20.9 \u03BCM. Norkurarinol also significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of proinflammatory and adhesive molecules induced by poly(I:C) and rotavirus infection. Pretreatment of norkurarinol blocked the NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of MAPKs induced by poly(I:C). On the other hand, norkurarinol increased the level of IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN\u03B2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, norkurarinol inhibited the rotavirus-induced cytopathic effects.

TLR are a family of type 1 transmembrane proteins, responsible for recognising molecular patterns associated with pathogens (PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns), and expressed by a broad spectrum of infectious agents. This recognition leads to a quick production of cytokines and chemokines which provides a long-lasting adaptive response to the pathogen. At present, it is considered //It is currently considered that the administration of drugs which modulate the activity of these receptors upwards or downwards may represent major therapeutic progress for handling these diseases.

Two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats (A and B) differing in average daily weight gain were used. Female rats of substrain A gained 2 g per day and males gained 7 g. Female rats of substrain B gained 5 g per day and males gained 8 g. Animals were implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula, allowing ICV injections into the lateral ventricle. ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 \u03BCg of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 \u03BCl were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 \u03BCg of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 \u03BCg of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A.

In 36 cases of acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, attempts were made to isolate viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae from the pharynx and otorrhea.

T cells can serve a variety of functions as part of the host immune response during CNS viral infection. They can participate directly in viral clearance from the brain, or they can promote the survival of the host without exerting any direct effect on virus replication. Only a small number of T cells infiltrate the brain under normal circumstances. This paucity of immune surveillance of baseline is one of several reasons why the CNS has often been characterized as an \u201Cimmunologically privileged\u201D site. T cell-mediated lysis of infected cells has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism of viral clearance from tissues other than the CNS. In several well-characterized animal models of CNS viral infection, part of the elicited T cell response actually contributes to the pathology and adverse outcome of disease. Neurotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection of adult mice is the premier example of this phenomenon.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Irani, David N.; Griffin, Diane E.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130905/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contribution of T cells","elicited T cell response","viral infections","small number of T cells","T cell-mediated lysis of infected cells","individual T cell effector functions","well-characterized animal models of CNS viral infection","important mechanism of viral clearance","host immune response","brain","variety of functions","virus replication","Neurotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection of adult mice","pathogenesis of neurologic disease","adverse outcome of disease","paucity of immune surveillance of baseline","specific examples","central nervous system\u0027s","pathology","tissues","premier example","direct effect","normal circumstances","phenomenon","reasons","chapter","site","survival"],"language":"en"},

In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc(3)Man(8,9)(GIcNAc)(2) and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein. The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man(9)(GIcNAc)(2). However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures. When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles. In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes. These observations taken together with the plaque test data intimate that Sindbis virus preferentially buds from internal membranes in BHK cells treated with dMM. The results confirm the essential role of glucose trimming in the Sindbis virus-BHK cell system and suggest that the initial stages of mannose removal maybe important too.","publish_time":"2004-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"McDowell, William; Romero, Pedro A.; Datema, Roelf; Schwarz, Ralph T.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQ3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BHK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["yield of virus","appearance of virus","maturation of Sindbis virus","dMM-treated cultures","presence of intracellular virus particles","Sindbis virus-BHK cell system","BHK cells","viral glycoproteins","lining intracellular membranes","oligosaccharides","E2 viral envelope glycoprotein","pE2","composition Man","extracellular medium","GIcNAc","internal membranes","roles of glucose","composition GIc","essential role of glucose","initial stages of mannose removal","glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl","inhibitors of glycoprotein oligosaccharide processing","plaque test data intimate","proteolytic cleavage","precursor","nucleocapsids","deoxynojirimycin","electron microscopy","block","results","addition","deoxymannojirimycin","difference","observations","mannosidase","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Genome transcription is a critical stage in the life cycle of a virus, as this is the process by which the viral genetic information is presented to the host cell protein-synthesis machinery for the production of the viral proteins needed for genome replication and progeny virion assembly. Viruses with dsRNA genomes face a particular challenge in that host cells do not produce proteins that can transcribe from a dsRNA template. One of the more striking observations about genome transcription in dsRNA viruses is that this process occurs efficiently only when the transcriptionally competent particle is fully intact. This observation suggests that all of the components of the transcriptionally competent particle, including the viral genome, the transcription enzymes, and the viral capsid, function together to produce and release messenger RNA transcripts and that each component has a specific and critical role to play in promoting the efficiency of this process.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawton, Jeffrey A; Estes, Mary K; Venkataram Prasad, B.V","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131957/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral genome","dsRNA viruses","mechanism of genome transcription","genome replication","viral proteins","process","transcription enzymes","dsRNA genomes","viral capsid","dsRNA template","viral genetic information","competent particle","host cells","critical stage","critical role","segmented double-stranded RNA","release messenger RNA transcripts","host cell protein-synthesis machinery","particular challenge","production","progeny virion assembly","striking observations","life cycle","function","components","chapter","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

In this exposed position they contribute significantly to the structural properties of these molecules, both in solution and on cell surfaces. Therefore, it is not surprising that Sias are important regulators of cellular and molecular interactions, in which they play a dual role. They can either mask recognition sites or serve as recognition determinants. Whereas the role of Sias in masking and in binding of pathogens to host cells has been documented over many years, their role in nonpathological cellular interaction has only been shown recently. The aim of this chapter is to summarize our knowledge about Sias in masking, for example, galactose residues, and to review the progress made during the past few years with respect to Sias as recognition determinants in the adhesion of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, and particularly as binding sites for endogenous cellular interaction molecules. Finally, perspectives for future research on these topics are discussed.","publish_time":"2008-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelm, S\u00F8rge; Schauer, Roland","journal":"Int Rev Cytol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of Sias","recognition determinants","binding sites","masking","years","mask recognition sites","endogenous cellular interaction molecules","nonpathological cellular interaction","dual role","important regulators of cellular","binding of pathogens","adhesion of pathogenic viruses","terminal components","glycoproteins","glycolipids","protozoa","respect","bacteria","molecular interactions","example","past","galactose residues","Sialic acids","perspectives","future research","topics","higher animals","solution","progress","cells","knowledge","structural properties","chapter","cell surfaces","exposed position","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, silica itself had a marked protective effect against MHV3 infection that was maximal when injecting 1 mg 2 hrs before virus infection. The protective effect of silica was observed in a number of inbred mouse strains that differ in their relative resistance to MHV3 infection. No viral titers were observed in the spleen and liver of mice which had received MHV3 plus silica, whereas high titers were observed in the virus-infected controls. Injection of silica caused a marked decrease in the number of esterase-positive macrophages in the peritoneal wash-out population, that may be compatible with the possibility that the cause of the protection is the depletion of target cells for the viral infection. This latter effect, however, was short-lived and 24\u201348 hrs after injection of silica, high numbers of esterase-positive cells were again observed. This may explain why only little protection was observed when silica was administered 2 days before virus infection.","publish_time":"2011-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schindler, L.; Br\u00FCcher, J.; Kirchner, H.","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozc3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Injection of silica","MHV3 infection","protective effect of silica","virus infection","viral infection","marked protective effect","number of esterase","positive cells","high titers","hrs","viral titers","high numbers of esterase","virus-infected controls","marked decrease","positive macrophages","relative resistance","liver of mice","little protection","depletion of target cells","number of inbred mouse strains","peritoneal wash","cause","spleen","C57BL","population","possibility","days","parvum"],"language":"en"},

Recently, the expression of the APN gene in T cell lines as well as the induction of APN gene and surface expression in human peripheral T cells by mitogenic activation have been demonstrated. Here, by means of cytofluorimetric analysis evidence is provided, that the induction of APN surface expression is partially resistent to the action of the inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, puromycin and cycloheximide, and is not prevented by tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation. These data suggest that the rapid mitogen-induced surface expression of APN, detectable 20 hours after stimulation is dominated by mechanisms not dependent on de novo protein biosynthesis or glycosylation. As shown by simultaneous analyses, the inhibitors used did also differently modify the induction of surface expression of other inducible glycosylated leukocyte surface antigens, namely CD25, CD69 and CD95.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lendeckel, Uwe; Wex, Thomas; Ittenson, Annelore; Arndt, Marco; Frank, Karin; Mayboroda, Oleg; Schubert, Walter; Ansorge, Siegfried","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozc3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induction of APN surface expression","induction of surface expression","induction of APN gene","rapid mitogen-induced surface expression of APN","inhibitors of protein biosynthesis","inducible glycosylated leukocyte surface antigens","novo protein biosynthesis","human peripheral T cells","malignant cells","inhibitor of glycosylation","T cell lines","CD25","membrane bound metalloprotease aminopeptidase N","small group of patients","mechanisms","stimulation","CD13","mitogenic activation","hours","action","resistent","established marker of normal","myelo-monocytic lineage","CD69","puromycin","chronic lymphoid leukaemia","leukaemic blasts","cycloheximide","cytofluorimetric analysis evidence","CD95","data","tunicamycin","simultaneous analyses"],"language":"en"},

The precise mechanisms by which this can occur are mostly unknown. Viruses have been implicated in this process, among other etiological factors, such as genetic predisposition and cytokine activity. Several ways have been proposed by which a viral infection might break tolerance to self and trigger an autoreactive cascade that ultimately leads to the destruction of a specific cell type or an entire organ. The process termed \u2018molecular mimicry\u2019 and the use of transgenic models in which viral and host genes can be manipulated to analyze their effects in causing autoimmunity have been particular focuses for research. For example, there is a transgenic murine model of virus-induced autoimmune disease, in which a known viral gene is selectively expressed as a self-antigen in \u03B2 cells of the pancreas. In these mice, insulin-dependent diabetes develops after either a viral infection, the release of a cytokine such as IFN-\u03B3, or the expression of the costimulatory molecule B7.1 in the islets of Langerhans.

The LTA4H is a bi-functional enzyme that also exhibits aminopeptidase activity with a preference over arginyl tripeptides. Various mutations including E271Q, R563A, and K565A have completely or partially abolished both the functions of this enzyme. The crystal structures with these mutations have not shown any structural changes to address the loss of functions. Molecular dynamics simulations of LTA4 and tripeptide complex structures with functional mutations were performed to investigate the structural and conformation changes that scripts the observed differences in catalytic functions. The observed protein-ligand hydrogen bonds and distances between the important catalytic components have correlated well with the experimental results. This study also confirms based on the structural observation that E271 is very important for both the functions as it holds the catalytic metal ion at its location for the catalysis and it also acts as N-terminal recognition residue during peptide binding. The comparison of binding modes of substrates revealed the structural changes explaining the importance of R563 and K565 residues and the required alignment of substrate at the active site.

However, the precise mechanism of action and the spatio-temporal pattern of BMP-signaling during these processes remains inadequately described. To address this, we have utilized a transgenic line harboring a BMP-responsive eGFP-reporter allele (BRE-eGFP) to construct the first detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP-pathway activation during lung development, homeostasis and adult-lung injury repair. We demonstrate that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis progresses in the developing lung, canonical BMP-pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the sub-epithelial smooth muscle layer of the proximal airways. Activation of the BMP-pathway becomes evident in epithelial compartments only after embryonic day (E) 14.5 primarily in cells negative for epithelial-lineage markers, located in the proximal portion of the airway-tree, clusters adjacent to neuro-epithelial-bodies (NEBs) and in a substantial portion of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathway becomes activated in isolated E12.5 mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that absence of reporter activity in these regions stems from a dynamic cross-talk between endoderm and mesenchyme. Epithelial cells with activated BMP-pathway are enriched in progenitors capable of forming colonies in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. As lung morphogenesis approaches completion, eGFP-expression declines and in adult lung its expression is barely detectable. However, upon tissue-injury, either with naphthalene or bleomycin, the canonical BMP-pathways is re-activated, in bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells respectively, in a manner reminiscent to early lung development and in tissue areas where reparatory progenitor cells reside. Our studies illustrate the dynamic activation of canonical BMP-pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-repair and highlight its involvement in two important processes, namely, the early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of epithelial progenitor pools both during lung development and repair of adult lung tissue-injury.","publish_time":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sountoulidis, Alexandros; Stavropoulos, Athanasios; Giaglis, Stavros; Apostolou, Eirini; Monteiro, Rui; Chuva de Sousa Lopes, Susana M.; Chen, Huaiyong; Stripp, Barry R.; Mummery, Christine; Andreakos, Evangelos; Sideras, Paschalis","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c39ab56559377e3b362be55e8e989e059a01fb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3423416.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3423416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bone Morphogenetic Proteins"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early lung development","developing lung","adult lung tissue-repair","adult lung homeostasis","adult-lung injury repair","activated BMP-pathway","repair of adult lung tissue-injury","neuro-epithelial","epithelial compartments","dynamic activation of canonical BMP-pathway","canonical BMP-pathways","early development","tissue-injury repair","lung morphogenesis approaches completion","substantial portion of alveolar epithelial cells","epithelial-lineage markers","detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP-pathway activation","management of epithelial progenitor pools","BMP-responsive eGFP-reporter allele","tissue areas","spatio-temporal pattern of BMP","mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds","reparatory progenitor cells","sub-epithelial smooth muscle layer","eGFP-expression declines","BRE-eGFP","proximal portion","proximal airways","dynamic cross","important processes","three-dimensional Matrigel cultures","absence of reporter activity","vascular network","airway-tree","clusters adjacent","isolated E12","pulmonary vasculature","manner reminiscent","colonies","regions","NEBs","progenitors capable","bleomycin","naphthalene","embryonic day","bodies","involvement","precise mechanism of action","transgenic line","endoderm","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","studies","pseudoglandular stage"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies have demonstrated that CTCL cells overexpress the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a xenograft model of CTCL was established and a recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 8 (AAV8) vector expressing a humanized single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-Fc fusion (scFvFc or \u201Cminibody\u201D) of anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) h1567 was evaluated for curative treatment. Human CCR4(\u002B) tumor-bearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumor-infiltrating Ly-6G(\u002B) Fc\u03B3RIIIa(CD16A)(\u002B) murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice. Furthermore, in CCR4(\u002B) tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A(\u002B) CD56(\u002B) NK cells was observed. The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our data demonstrate that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 minibody is mediated, at least in part, through CD16A(\u002B) immune effector cell ADCC mechanisms. These data further demonstrate the utility of the AAV-minibody gene transfer system in the rapid evaluation of candidate anti-tumor mAbs and the potency of h1567 as a potential novel therapy for CTCL.","publish_time":"2012-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Thomas; Abdel-Motal, Ussama M.; Chang, De-Kuan; Sui, Jianhua; Muvaffak, Asli; Campbell, James; Zhu, Quan; Kupper, Thomas S.; Marasco, Wayne A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99e7ae6647b3aef265d79aa84720e5e5b584118d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3433438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3433438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTCL","NK","ADCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AAV8-h1567 minibody","anti-tumor activity of h1567 minibody","AAV8-control minibody","potency of h1567","tumor xenografts","number of tumor","CTCL cells","tumor infiltration of human CD16A","Human CCR4","human NK cells","rapid evaluation of candidate anti-tumor mAbs","ADCC activity","anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody","AAV-minibody gene transfer system","intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions","human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","xenograft model of CTCL","mice co-","data","mouse neutrophils","murine neutrophils","increased survival","curative treatment","immune effector cell ADCC mechanisms","potential novel therapy","Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma","patients","PBMCs","humanized single-chain variable fragment","vector","Fc fusion","study","viral serotype","CC chemokine receptor","therapeutic options","recombinant adeno","infiltrating Ly","scFvFc","utility","CD56","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Recent studies","METHODOLOGY","BACKGROUND","SIGNIFICANCE","Fc\u03B3RIIIa","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We describe our experience using lung ultrasound in a case series of patients with respiratory symptoms requiring chest X-ray during the initial onset and surge of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. METHODS: We describe a case series of patients from a prospective observational cohort study of lung ultrasound, enrolling patients requiring chest X-ray for suspected pneumonia that coincided with the onset and surge of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: Twenty pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza patients requiring chest X-ray were enrolled during this time period. Median age was 6.7 years. Lung ultrasound via modified Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency protocol assisted in the identification of viral pneumonia (n = 15; 75%), viral pneumonia with superimposed bacterial pneumonia (n = 7; 35%), isolated bacterial pneumonia only (n = 1; 5%), and no findings of viral or bacterial pneumonia (n = 4; 20%) in this cohort of patients.

We examined the rates of DAI by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and 30\u2013day and in\u2013hospital mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Prospective surveillance was conducted in a mixed medical and surgical ICU at a major teaching hospital from 2000 through 2008. Trend analysis was performed and logistic regression was used to assess prognostic factors of mortality. RESULTS: The overall rate of DAIs was 3.03 episodes per 1000 device\u2013days. The most common DAI type was catheter\u2013associated urinary tract infection (3.76 per 1000 urinary catheter\u2013days). There was a decrease in DAI rates in 2005 and rates of ventilator\u2013associated pneumonia (VAP, 3.18 per 1000 ventilator\u2013days) have remained low since then (p \u003C 0.001). The crude rates of 30\u2013day (33.6%) and in\u2013hospital (52.3%) mortality, as well as infection by antibiotic-resistant VAP pathogens also decreased. The most common antimicrobial-resistant pathogens were methicillin\u2013resistant Staphylococcus aureus (94.9%) and imipenem\u2013resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (p \u003C 0.001), which also increased at the most rapid rate.

It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response. To efficiently infect humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon response. DENV circumvents the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity. We have recently documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the NS2B3 protease complex. We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV. Additionally, we show that DENV NS2B3 is not able to degrade the mouse version of STING, a phenomenon that severely restricts the replication of DENV in mouse cells, suggesting that STING plays a key role in the inhibition of DENV infection and spread in mice.","publish_time":"2012-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguirre, Sebastian; Maestre, Ana M.; Pagni, Sarah; Patel, Jenish R.; Savage, Timothy; Gutman, Delia; Maringer, Kevin; Bernal-Rubio, Dabeiba; Shabman, Reed S.; Simon, Viviana; Rodriguez-Madoz, Juan R.; Mulder, Lubbertus C.

This system allows specific immobilization of proteins and sensitive detection of targets, which were verified by surface plasmon resonance analysis and successfully applied to electrochemical cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy upto 0.14 ng/mL HBsAg.","publish_time":"2012-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heo, Nam Su; Zheng, Shun; Yang, MinHo; Lee, Seok Jae; Lee, Sang Yup; Kim, Hwa-Jung; Park, Jung Youn; Lee, Chang-Soo; Park, Tae Jung","journal":"Sensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4dedf2b46618a544180539e2a2943c3618b8fec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3472818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3472818/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gold surface","gold electrode surface","Gold-binding polypeptide","gold substrate","HBV surface antigen","target binding","GBP-ScFv fusion protein","HBsAg","surface plasmon resonance analysis","strong binding affinity","one-step immobilization strategy","simple electrochemical biosensing strategy","engineered protein","electrochemical cyclic voltammetry","specific immobilization of proteins","recognition site orients","activity of biological recognition elements","impedance spectroscopy upto","label-free diagnosis of hepatitis B virus","fabrication process","sample","single-chain antibody","sensitive detection of targets","chemical modification","forms","system","time"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we have evaluated the use of an anionic self-adjuvanting lipopeptide containing the TLR2 agonist Pam(2)Cys (E(8)Pam(2)Cys) to enhance the immunogenicity of VLPs containing the HCV structural proteins (core, E1 and E2) of genotype 1a. While co-formulation of this lipopeptide with VLPs only resulted in marginal improvements in dendritic cell (DC) uptake, its ability to concomitantly induce DC maturation at very small doses is a feature not observed using VLPs alone or in the presence of an aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant (Alum). Dramatically improved VLP and E2-specific antibody responses were observed in VLP\u002BE(8)Pam(2)Cys vaccinated mice where up to 3 doses of non-adjuvanted or traditionally alum-adjuvanted VLPs was required to match the antibody titres obtained with a single dose of VLPs formulated with this lipopeptide. This result also correlated with significantly higher numbers of specific antibody secreting cells that was detected in the spleens of VLP\u002BE(8)Pam(2)Cys vaccinated mice and greater ability of sera from these mice to neutralise the binding and uptake of VLPs by Huh7 cells. Moreover, vaccination of HLA-A2 transgenic mice with this formulation also induced better VLP-specific IFN-\u03B3-mediated responses compared to non-adjuvanted VLPs but comparable levels to that achieved when coadministered with complete freund\u2019s adjuvant. These results suggest overall that the immunogenicity of HCV VLPs can be significantly improved by the addition of this novel adjuvant by targeting their delivery to DCs and could therefore constitute a viable vaccine strategy for the treatment of HCV.","publish_time":"2012-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chua, Brendon Y.; Johnson, Douglas; Tan, Amabel; Earnest-Silveira, Linda; Sekiya, Toshiki; Chin, Ruth; Torresi, Joseph; Jackson, David C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75396899537915606b74f2b600478ad066f9d594.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3472981.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3472981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pam"],"organizations":["HCV","VLP","VLP E"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunogenicity of VLPs","uptake of VLPs","immunogenicity of HCV VLPs","non-adjuvanted VLPs","alum-adjuvanted VLPs","improved VLP","Cys vaccinated mice","single dose of VLPs","spleens of VLP","E2-specific antibody responses","treatment of HCV","doses of non-adjuvanted","better VLP-specific IFN-\u03B3","TLR2 agonist Pam","A2 transgenic mice","HCV structural proteins","development of HCV virus","antibody titres","novel adjuvant","higher numbers of specific antibody secreting cells","aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant","complete freund\u2019s adjuvant","mediated responses","based vaccines","anionic self-adjuvanting lipopeptide","DC maturation","small doses","Huh7 cells","co-formulation","greater ability of sera","heterologous viral vectors","E1","particle","marginal improvements","multiple dosing regimes","fact","use","dendritic cell","core","strong evidence","viable vaccine strategy","vaccination of HLA","presence","comparable levels","binding","protective immunity","studies","delivery","DCs","feature","genotype","addition","study","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: During April to December 2009, we actively searched for persons with severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness (ILI) in three sentinel cities. A proportion of case-patients provided swabs for influenza testing. We estimated the number of case-patients that would have tested positive for influenza by multiplying the number of untested case-patients by the proportion who tested positive. We estimated rates by dividing the estimated number of case-patients by the census population after adjusting for the proportion of case-patients with missing illness onset information and ILI case-patients who visited physicians multiple times for one illness event. RESULTS: We estimated that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mortality rate per 100,000 person-years (py) ranged from 1.5 among persons aged 5\u201344 years to 5.6 among persons aged \u226565 years. A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization rates per 100,000 py ranged between 26.9 among children aged \u003C5 years to 41.8 among persons aged \u226565 years. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 ILI rates per 100 py ranged between 1.6 among children aged \u003C5 to 17.1 among persons aged 45\u201364 years. While 9 (53%) of 17 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 decedents with available data had obesity and 7 (17%) of 40 had diabetes, less than 4% of surviving influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 case-patients had these pre-existing conditions (p\u22640.001). CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 caused a similar burden of disease in Argentina as in other countries. Such disease burden suggests the potential value of timely influenza vaccinations.","publish_time":"2012-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Cabrera, Ana Mar\u00EDa; Chang, Loretta; Calli, Rogelio; Kusznierz, Gabriela; Baez, Clarisa; Yedlin, Pablo; Zamora, Ana Mar\u00EDa; Cuezzo, Romina; Sarrouf, Elena Beatriz; Uboldi, Andrea; Herrmann, Juan; Zerbini, Elsa; Uez, Osvaldo; Rico Cordeiro, Pedro Osvaldo; Chavez, Pollyanna; Han, George; Antman, Juli\u00E1n; Coronado, Fatima; Bresee, Joseph; Kosacoff, Marina; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Echenique, Horacio","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d4793842e3eeae37f34abb1541b0cee61ff976d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3485247.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["North America","South America","Argentina"],"keyphrases":["pdm09 case-patients","H1N1","burden of influenza","ILI case-patients","influenza testing","surviving influenza","proportion of case","persons","estimated number of case","number of untested case-patients","pdm09 ILI rates","pdm09 decedents","pdm09 hospitalization rates","person-years","pdm09 mortality rate","disease burden","py","potential value of timely influenza vaccinations","similar burden of disease","illness event","children","missing illness onset information","available data","little data","North America","South America","physicians multiple times","severe acute respiratory infection","swabs","pre-existing conditions","Argentina","obesity","census population","sentinel cities","countries","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","METHODS","diabetes"],"language":"en"},

The bacterium is the causative agent of C. difficile infection (CDI), for which the symptoms can range from a mild diarrhea to potentially fatal pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Endospore formation in Firmicutes, including C. difficile, is governed by the key regulator for sporulation, Spo0A. In Bacillus subtilis, this transcription factor is also directly or indirectly involved in various other cellular processes. Here, we report that C. difficile Spo0A shows a high degree of similarity to the well characterized B. subtilis protein and recognizes a similar binding sequence. We find that the laboratory strain C. difficile 630\u0394erm contains an 18bp-duplication near the DNA-binding domain compared to its ancestral strain 630. In vitro binding assays using purified C-terminal DNA binding domain of the C. difficile Spo0A protein demonstrate direct binding to DNA upstream of spo0A and sigH, early sporulation genes and several other putative targets. In vitro binding assays suggest that the gene encoding the major clostridial toxin TcdB may be a direct target of Spo0A, but supernatant derived from a spo0A negative strain was no less toxic towards Vero cells than that obtained from a wild type strain, in contrast to previous reports. These results identify for the first time direct (putative) targets of the Spo0A protein in C. difficile and make a positive effect of Spo0A on production of the large clostridial toxins unlikely.","publish_time":"2012-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosenbusch, Katharina E.; Bakker, Dennis; Kuijper, Ed J.; Smits, Wiep Klaas","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0fb3bbd96dad4c907c7fd456cd5783ed8fa7bd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3485338.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["difficile Spo0A protein","direct binding","spo0A negative strain","direct target of Spo0A","binding assays","difficile infection","Clostridium difficile","DNA-binding domain","positive effect of Spo0A","similar binding sequence","subtilis protein","laboratory strain","ancestral strain","purified C-terminal DNA binding domain","time direct","wild type strain","putative targets","Gram positive","toxic megacolon","anaerobic bacterium","Bacillus subtilis","early sporulation genes","major clostridial toxin TcdB","large clostridial toxins unlikely","production","fatal pseudomembranous colitis","mild diarrhea","contrast","\u0394erm","sigH","high degree of similarity","causative agent of","bp-duplication","CDI","previous reports","key regulator","symptoms","transcription factor","Vero cells","Firmicutes","resistant endospores","Endospore formation","cellular processes","results"],"language":"en"},

Two glycosites were located at HA0 cleavage sites and fusion peptides and were strikingly conserved in all HA subtypes, while the remaining glycosites were unique to their subtypes.

Either vaccine virus replicated preferentially in secondary lymphoid organs and to a lesser extent in epithelium-rich tissues (e.g., intestine, urinary bladder and trachea) and the liver.

It is known to play an important role in innate immunity, inflammatory regulation, and female fertility. PTX3 is synthesized by specific cells, primarily in response to inflammatory signals. Among these various cells, neutrophils have a unique PTX3 production system. Neutrophils store PTX3 in neutrophil-specific granules and then the stored PTX3 is released and localizes in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although certain NET components have been identified, such as histones and anti-microbial proteins, the detailed mechanisms by which NETs localize, as well as capture and kill microbes, have not been fully elucidated. PTX3 is a candidate diagnostic marker of infection and vascular damage. In severe infectious diseases such as sepsis, the circulating PTX3 concentration increases greatly (up to 100 ng/mL, i.e., up to 100-fold of the normal level). Even though it is clearly implied that PTX3 plays a protective role in sepsis and certain other disorders, the detailed mechanisms by which it does so remain unclear. A proteomic study of PTX3 ligands in septic patients revealed that PTX3 forms a complex with certain NET component proteins. This suggests a role for PTX3 in which it facilitates the efficiency of anti-microbial protein pathogen clearance by interacting with both pathogens and anti-microbial proteins. We discuss the possible relationships between PTX3 and NET component proteins in the host protection afforded by the innate immune response. The PTX3 complex has the potential to be a highly useful diagnostic marker of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2012-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daigo, Kenji; Hamakubo, Takao","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dfc59a66e7a86f6a40c5fafad4c12f483ce40bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3521240.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pentraxin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PTX3 complex","stored PTX3","Neutrophils store PTX3","circulating PTX3 concentration","proteomic study of PTX3 ligands","unique PTX3 production system","anti-microbial proteins","certain NET component proteins","inflammatory diseases","certain NET components","useful diagnostic marker of sepsis","inflammatory regulation","specific cells","protective role","inflammatory signals","important role","detailed mechanisms","NETs","long-pentraxin","pentraxin family","efficiency of anti-microbial protein pathogen clearance","neutrophil-specific granules","innate immune response","candidate diagnostic marker of infection","innate immunity","various cells","neutrophil extracellular traps","severe infectious diseases","host protection","septic patients","pathogens","disorders","vascular damage","possible relationships","soluble pattern recognition receptor","potential","female fertility","histones","microbes","fold","normal level","capture"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we evaluated if AAV manipulates the UPR pathways during its infection. We first examined the role of the three major UPR axes, namely, endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1\u03B1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in AAV infected cells. Total RNA from mock or AAV infected HeLa cells were used to determine the levels of 8 different ER-stress responsive transcripts from these pathways. We observed a significant up-regulation of IRE1\u03B1 (up to 11 fold) and PERK (up to 8 fold) genes 12\u201348 hours after infection with self-complementary (sc)AAV2 but less prominent with single-stranded (ss)AAV2 vectors. Further studies demonstrated that scAAV1 and scAAV6 also induce cellular UPR in vitro, with AAV1 vectors activating the PERK pathway (3 fold) while AAV6 vectors induced a significant increase on all the three major UPR pathways [6\u201316 fold]. These data suggest that the type and strength of UPR activation is dependent on the viral capsid. We then examined if transient inhibition of UPR pathways by RNA interference has an effect on AAV transduction. siRNA mediated silencing of PERK and IRE1\u03B1 had a modest effect on AAV2 and AAV6 mediated gene expression (\u223C1.5\u20132 fold) in vitro. Furthermore, hepatic gene transfer of scAAV2 vectors in vivo, strongly elevated IRE1\u03B1 and PERK pathways (2 and 3.5 fold, respectively). However, when animals were pre-treated with a pharmacological UPR inhibitor (metformin) during scAAV2 gene transfer, the UPR signalling and its subsequent inflammatory response was attenuated concomitant to a modest 2.8 fold increase in transgene expression. Collectively, these data suggest that AAV vectors activate the cellular UPR pathways and their selective inhibition may be beneficial during AAV mediated gene transfer.","publish_time":"2013-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balakrishnan, Balaji; Sen, Dwaipayan; Hareendran, Sangeetha; Roshini, Vaani; David, Sachin; Srivastava, Alok; Jayandharan, Giridhara R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e32842d3ebcee3ffaf4b6822dbac0f41f82130a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3540029.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AAV","UPR","PERK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular UPR pathways","major UPR pathways","UPR signalling","AAV vectors","PERK pathways","transient inhibition of UPR pathways","fold increase","major UPR axes","strength of UPR activation","pharmacological UPR inhibitor","AAV mediated gene transfer","AAV transduction","AAV6 vectors","AAV infected cells","scAAV2 gene transfer","hepatic gene transfer of scAAV2 vectors","AAV1 vectors","AAV6 mediated gene expression","AAV infected HeLa cells","elevated IRE1\u03B1","siRNA mediated silencing of PERK","regulation of IRE1\u03B1","modest effect","ER kinase","significant increase","infection","data","different ER-stress responsive transcripts","RNA interference","selective inhibition","Total RNA","transgene expression","stress-induced cyto-protective mechanism","subsequent inflammatory response","unfolded protein response","attenuated concomitant","metformin","proteins","hours","PKR","endoribonuclease inositol","influx of large","ATF6","levels","scAAV1","scAAV6","type","viral capsid","endoplasmic reticulum","transcription factor","enzyme","genes","role","studies","present study","animals"],"language":"en"},

To investigate microbial diversity and quantity in the brain, the profile of infectious agents was examined in pathologically normal and abnormal brains from persons with HIV/AIDS [HIV] (n = 12), other disease controls [ODC] (n = 14) and in cerebral surgical resections for epilepsy [SURG] (n = 6). Deep sequencing of cerebral white matter-derived RNA from the HIV (n = 4) and ODC (n = 4) patients and SURG (n = 2) groups revealed bacterially-encoded 16 s RNA sequences in all brain specimens with \u03B1-proteobacteria representing over 70% of bacterial sequences while the other 30% of bacterial classes varied widely. Bacterial rRNA was detected in white matter glial cells by in situ hybridization and peptidoglycan immunoreactivity was also localized principally in glia in human brains. Analyses of amplified bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences disclosed that Proteobacteria was the principal bacterial phylum in all human brain samples with similar bacterial rRNA quantities in HIV and ODC groups despite increased host neuroimmune responses in the HIV group. Exogenous viruses including bacteriophage and human herpes viruses-4, -5 and -6 were detected variably in autopsied brains from both clinical groups. Brains from SIV- and SHIV-infected macaques displayed a profile of bacterial phyla also dominated by Proteobacteria but bacterial sequences were not detected in experimentally FIV-infected cat or RAG1(\u2212/\u2212) mouse brains. Intracerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into RAG1(\u2212/\u2212) mice revealed a preponderance of \u03B1-proteobacteria 16 s RNA sequences in the brains of recipient mice at 7 weeks post-implantation, which was abrogated by prior heat-treatment of the brain homogenate. Thus, \u03B1-proteobacteria represented the major bacterial component of the primate brain\u2019s microbiome regardless of underlying immune status, which could be transferred into na\u00EFve hosts leading to microbial persistence in the brain.","publish_time":"2013-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Branton, William G.; Ellestad, Kristofor K.; Maingat, Ferdinand; Wheatley, B.

It has also been demonstrated that multiple subsets of dendritic cells (DC), including DC-SIGN(\u002B) cells, become significantly depleted in the blood and lymphoid tissues of AIDS patients, which may contribute to the failure in initiating effective host immune responses. The mechanism for DC depletion, however, is unclear. It is also known that vast quantities of viral envelope protein gp120 are shed from maturing HIV-1 virions and form circulating immune complexes in the serum of HIV-1-infected individuals, but the pathological role of gp120 in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism of DC death in chronic HIV-1 infection, in which ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DC to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of activation stimuli. The cultured monocyte-derived DC and also freshly-isolated DC-SIGN(\u002B) blood DC that were exposed to either cross-linked recombinant gp120 or immune-complex gp120 in HIV(\u002B) serum underwent considerable apoptosis after CD40 ligation or exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03B1 and IL-1\u03B2. Furthermore, circulating DC-SIGN(\u002B) DC that were isolated directly from HIV-1(\u002B) individuals had actually been pre-sensitized by serum gp120 for activation-induced exorbitant apoptosis. In all cases the DC apoptosis was substantially inhibited by DC-SIGN blockade. Finally, we showed that accelerated DC apoptosis was a direct consequence of excessive activation of the pro-apoptotic molecule ASK-1 and transfection of siRNA against ASK-1 significantly prevented the activation-induced excessive DC death. Our study discloses a previously unknown mechanism of immune modulation by envelope protein gp120, provides new insights into HIV immunopathogenesis, and suggests potential therapeutic approaches to prevent DC depletion in chronic HIV infection.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yongxiong; Hwang, Shiuh-Lin; Chan, Vera S.

The reconstitution of membrane proteins into a model membrane allows investigation of individual features and activities of a given cell membrane component. However, the activity of membrane proteins is often difficult to sustain following reconstitution, since the composition of the model phospholipid bilayer differs from that of the native cell membrane. This review will discuss the reconstitution of membrane protein activities in four different types of model membrane\u2014monolayers, supported lipid bilayers, liposomes and nanodiscs, comparing their advantages in membrane protein reconstitution. Variation in the surrounding model environments for these four different types of membrane layer can affect the three-dimensional structure of reconstituted proteins and may possibly lead to loss of the proteins activity. We also discuss examples where the same membrane proteins have been successfully reconstituted into two or more model membrane systems with comparison of the observed activity in each system. Understanding of the behavioral changes for proteins in model membrane systems after membrane reconstitution is often a prerequisite to protein research.

Here we extend the characterization of the transmission and gene expression of recombinant VSV (rVSV) with the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G), and provide examples of its activity relative to the anterograde transsynaptic tracer form of rVSV. rVSV with RABV-G was found to drive strong expression of transgenes and to spread rapidly from neuron to neuron in only a retrograde manner. Depending upon how the RABV-G was delivered, VSV served as a polysynaptic or monosynaptic tracer, or was able to define projections through axonal uptake and retrograde transport. In animals co-infected with rVSV in its anterograde form, rVSV with RABV-G could be used to begin to characterize the similarities and differences in connections to different areas. rVSV with RABV-G provides a flexible, rapid, and versatile tracing tool that complements the previously described VSV-based anterograde transsynaptic tracer.","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beier, Kevin T.; Saunders, Arpiar B.; Oldenburg, Ian A.; Sabatini, Bernardo L.; Cepko, Constance L.","journal":"Front Neural Circuits","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee48061797d29eeef5a9e606841bf8ab04b1d75b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3566411.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3566411/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RABV-G","anterograde transsynaptic tracer form of rVSV","anterograde form","described VSV","gene expression of recombinant VSV","retrograde transsynaptic tracing ability","monosynaptic tracer","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","retrograde transport","retrograde manner","Recombinant viruses","connections","rabies virus glycoprotein","different areas","different glycoproteins","versatile tracing tool","strong expression of transgenes","activity relative","structure","projections","axonal uptake","transmission","powerful approach","function","understanding","synapses","differences","animals co-infected","dissection of neuronal circuitry","nervous system","neurons","characterization","similarities","examples"],"language":"en"},

Reports in the literature have indicated that to infect cells the incoming viruses either fuse their envelope directly with the plasma membrane or exploit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To study the entry process in human tissue culture cells (HeLa, A549), we used fluorescence microscopy and developed quantitative, FACS-based assays to follow virus binding to cells, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, membrane fusion, and infection. A variety of perturbants were employed to characterize the cellular processes involved. We found that immediately after binding to cells RSV activated a signaling cascade involving the EGF receptor, Cdc42, PAK1, and downstream effectors. This led to a series of dramatic actin rearrangements; the cells rounded up, plasma membrane blebs were formed, and there was a significant increase in fluid uptake. If these effects were inhibited using compounds targeting Na(\u002B)/H(\u002B) exchangers, myosin II, PAK1, and other factors, no infection was observed. The RSV was rapidly and efficiently internalized by an actin-dependent process that had all hallmarks of macropinocytosis. Rather than fusing with the plasma membrane, the viruses thus entered Rab5-positive, fluid-filled macropinosomes, and fused with the membranes of these on the average 50 min after internalization. Rab5 was required for infection. To find an explanation for the endocytosis requirement, which is unusual among paramyxoviruses, we analyzed the fusion protein, F, and could show that, although already cleaved by a furin family protease once, it underwent a second, critical proteolytic cleavage after internalization. This cleavage by a furin-like protease removed a small peptide from the F1 subunits, and made the virus infectious.","publish_time":"2013-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krzyzaniak, Magdalena Anna; Zumstein, Michael Thomas; Gerez, Juan Atilio; Picotti, Paola; Helenius, Ari","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d07d6b58460992a4530b7b24d66e8b3861036a50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3623752.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","EGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cells RSV","membrane fusion","plasma membrane blebs","virus binding","human tissue culture cells","endocytosis requirement","PAK1","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","virus infectious","internalization","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","actin-dependent process","furin family protease","entry process","fusion protein","incoming viruses","fluid uptake","Rab5-positive","critical proteolytic cleavage","severe respiratory tract infections","series of dramatic actin rearrangements","Cdc42","Paramyxoviridae","A549","intracellular trafficking","FACS-based assays","HeLa","cascade","small peptide","F1 subunits","fluorescence microscopy","paramyxoviruses","EGF receptor","envelope","pathogenic member","significant increase","macropinosomes","exchangers","myosin","downstream effectors","hallmarks of macropinocytosis","effects","compounds","membranes","average","explanation","literature","factors","variety of perturbants","cellular processes","Reports"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present on exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. The present study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFP) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present on exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of na\u00EFve T cells in vivo.

First, a panel of mimotopes was affinity-selected from a random peptide library and potential m36-binding residues were computationally predicted. Second, homology modeling of m36 and molecular docking of m36 onto gp120 revealed potentially important residues in gp120-m36 interactions. Third, the predicted contact residues were verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Taken together, m36 epitope comprising three discontinuous sites including six key gp120 residues (Site C1: Thr123 and Pro124; Site C3: Glu370 and Ile371; Site C4: Met426 and Trp427) were identified. In the 3D structure of gp120, the sites C1 and C4 are located in the bridging sheet and the site C3 is within the \u03B215-\u03B13 excursion, which play essential roles for the receptor- and coreceptor-binding and are major targets of neutralizing antibodies.

Herpes zoster virus encephalitis if not treated promptly can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of herpes zoster virus encephalitis is based on clinical history, examination, neuroradiological imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography scan), cerebrospinal fluid analysis and identification of the pathogen in cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or anti-herpes zoster virus immunoglobulin G antibody in cerebrospinal fluid. Although ischemic intracerebral infarcts in patients with herpes zoster virus encephalitis or vasculopathy are reported in the literature, multiple intracerebral hemorrhages as a complication of herpes zoster virus encephalitis in an immunocompetent individual are extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Indian man presented with an acute history of four episodes of seizures, fever, headache, drowsiness, focal neurological deficits and vesicular eruptions over the abdomen in a typical dermatomal distribution. His head computed tomography scan revealed multiple cerebral hemorrhages. Investigations (positive ratio between the cerebrospinal fluid/serum quotients for anti-herpes zoster virus immunoglobulin G and total immunoglobulin G antibodies) established its infective origin due to herpes zoster virus. He developed bilateral pneumonia during the hospital course. He had an excellent recovery following a 2 weeks\u2019 course of intravenous acyclovir. CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster virus encephalitis or vasculopathy is a rare cause of multiple intracerebral hemorrhages and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with an acute history of fever, altered consciousness, and focal neurologic deficits with history of a typical herpetic rash. Its prompt recognition and treatment could alter the course of illness.","publish_time":"2013-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saxena, Amrish; Khiangte, Benjamine; Tiewsoh, Iadarilang; Jajoo, Ulhas N","journal":"J Med Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36de0a2603f81b3678e4a3d0f10e1d1564dda5a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3693903.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693903/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of herpes zoster virus encephalitis","complication of herpes zoster virus encephalitis","anti-herpes zoster virus immunoglobulin G antibody","cerebrospinal fluid analysis","important cause of encephalitis","acute history of fever","rare cause of multiple intracerebral hemorrhages","clinical history","multiple cerebral hemorrhages","total immunoglobulin G antibodies","vasculopathy","hospital course","course of illness","head computed tomography scan","focal neurological deficits","focal neurologic deficits","ischemic intracerebral infarcts","differential diagnosis of patients","neuroradiological imaging","weeks\u2019 course of intravenous acyclovir","magnetic resonance imaging","typical herpetic rash","typical dermatomal distribution","serum quotients","headache","drowsiness","pathogen","altered consciousness","polymerase chain reaction amplification","infective origin","abdomen","vesicular eruptions","examination","identification","episodes of seizures","immunocompetent individual","year-old Indian man","positive ratio","treatment","literature","infection","CONCLUSION","bilateral pneumonia","excellent recovery","Investigations","INTRODUCTION","CASE PRESENTATION","prompt recognition","significant morbidity","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV-1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, and to its receptor CD4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p24 in the culture supernatant. The unmodified plasma protein fraction had no effect. HOCl-altered isolated proteins antithrombin III and human serum albumin, taken as representative examples of the whole pool of plasma proteins, were both able to exert the same activity of binding to gp120 and inhibition of viral proliferation. These data offer an opportunity to improve the understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and allow the generation of the following hypothetical scheme: natural immune defense mechanisms generate by posttranslational modification of plasma proteins a potent virucidal weapon that immobilizes the virus as well as inhibits viral fusion and thus entry into the host cells. Furthermore simulation of this mechanism in vitro might provide an interesting new therapeutic approach against microorganisms.","publish_time":"2013-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Speth, Cornelia; Brodde, Martin F.; Hagleitner, Magdalena; Rambach, G\u00FCnter; Van Aken, Hugo; Dierich, Manfred; Kehrel, Beate E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4156b347411e4071b10550a6acc2725c5e82df99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3694086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HOCl-altered plasma proteins","pool of plasma proteins","immune defence-altered protein","posttranslational modification of plasma proteins","Idea-PP","isolated proteins antithrombin","HIV","host cells","unmodified plasma protein fraction","envelope protein gp120","viral infection","viral fusion","Idea-Ps","myeloperoxidase system","reduction of viral capsid protein p24","protein disulfide isomerase","cell culture system","inhibition of viral proliferation","intricacies of host","natural immune defense mechanisms","potent amyloid","culture supernatant","reduced number of infected cells","secretion of myeloperoxidase","consequence of innate immune activation granulocytes","potent virucidal weapon","macrophages","hypochlorite","following hypothetical scheme","human serum albumin","replication","hypochlorous acid","generation","representative examples","SH-groups","virus","syncytia","interesting new therapeutic approach","microorganisms","pathogen interactions","antiviral weapons","activity of binding","effect","outside","entry","additional indirect mode of action","MPO","understanding","high affinity","PDI","doubt","capacity","receptor CD4","invading microorganism","opportunity","article","data","simulation"],"language":"en"},

Hepatocyte-specific knockout of the Cops8 gene (HS-Csn8KO) was shown to cause massive hepatocyte apoptosis and liver malfunction but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that Csn8/CSN exerts profound impacts on hepatic UPS function and is critical to the stability of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. Significant decreases in CIS (cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 domain-containing protein), a Bim receptor of a cullin2-based ubiquitin ligase, were found to co-exist with a marked increase of Bim proteins. Csn8 deficiency also significantly decreased 19S proteasome subunit Rpt5 and markedly increased high molecular weight neddylated and ubiquitinated proteins. The use of a surrogate UPS substrate further reveals severe impairment of UPS-mediated proteolysis in HS-Csn8KO livers. Inclusion body-like materials were accumulated in Csn8 deficient hepatocytes. In addition to Bim, massive hepatocyte apoptosis in HS-Csn8KO livers is also associated with elevated expression of other members of the Bcl2 family, including pro-apoptotic Bax as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-XL. Increased interaction between Bcl2 and Bim, but not between Bcl2 and Bax, was detected. Hence, it is concluded that hepatic CSN8 deficiency impairs the UPS in the liver and the resultant Bim upregulation likely plays an important role in triggering hepatocyte apoptosis via sequestering Bcl2 away from Bax.","publish_time":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Daoxiong; Li, Faqian; Su, Huabo; Liu, Jinbao; Wei, Ning; Wang, Xuejun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2659bd84b8347a97b54698fbc1dea43ef10a85e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3698095.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pro-apoptotic protein Bim","Bim receptor","massive hepatocyte apoptosis","anti-apoptotic Bcl2","sequestering Bcl2","Bcl2 family","hepatic CSN8 deficiency","triggering hepatocyte apoptosis","hepatic UPS function","HS-Csn8KO livers","pro-apoptotic Bax","resultant Bim upregulation","marked increase of Bim proteins","protein degradation","severe impairment of UPS","surrogate UPS substrate","Csn8 deficient hepatocytes","Hepatocyte-specific knockout","conserved protein complex","ubiquitin-proteasome system","liver malfunction","mediated proteolysis","ubiquitinated proteins","Increased interaction","S proteasome subunit Rpt5","cullin2-based ubiquitin ligase","critical mitotic parenchymal organ of vertebrates","important role","cytokine-inducible Src homology","CIS","high molecular weight","profound impacts","stability","unique subunits","Cops8 gene","domain","materials","CSN1","underlying mechanism","members","elevated expression","Bcl-XL","addition","Significant decreases","higher eukaryotes","use","Inclusion body","COP9 signalosome"],"language":"en"},

We asked if two resources: 1) free text, and 2) structured data from an electronic medical record (EMR) could complement each other to identify patients with pneumonia, an ARI severity landmark. METHODS: A manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits with associated chest imaging identified x-ray reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa score = 0.88 (95% CI 0.82\u22360.93)), along with attendant cases with Possible Pneumonia (adds either cough, sputum, fever/chills/night sweats, dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain) or with Pneumonia-in-Plan (adds pneumonia stated as a likely diagnosis by the provider). The x-ray reports served as a reference to develop a text classifier using machine-learning software that did not require custom coding. To identify pneumonia cases, the classifier was combined with EMR-based structured data and with text analyses aimed at ARI symptoms in clinical notes. RESULTS: 370 reference cases with Possible Pneumonia and 250 with Pneumonia-in-Plan were identified. The x-ray report text classifier increased the positive predictive value of otherwise identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms by 20\u201370%, while retaining sensitivities of 58\u201375%. These performance gains were independent of the case definitions and of whether patients were admitted to the hospital or sent home. Text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes did not add further value. CONCLUSION: Specialized software development is not required for automated text analyses to help identify pneumonia patients. These results begin to map an efficient, replicable strategy through which EMR data can be used to stratify ARI severity.","publish_time":"2013-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeLisle, Sylvain; Kim, Bernard; Deepak, Janaki; Siddiqui, Tariq; Gundlapalli, Adi; Samore, Matthew; D\u0027Avolio, Leonard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4e2f812c3232e60ac1af78fed10d292e28906d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3742728.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3742728/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["Possible Pneumonia","Specialized","EMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia cases","pneumonia patients","Possible Pneumonia","diagnosis of pneumonia","ARI symptoms","EMR data","free text","automated text analyses","ARI severity landmark","x-ray report text classifier","outpatient ARI visits","structured data","x-ray reports","reference cases","manual EMR review","identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms","clinical notes","disease severity","attendant cases","RESULTS","Plan","case definitions","likely diagnosis","associated chest imaging","pleuritic chest pain","positive predictive value","machine-learning software","Specialized software development","night sweats","chills","dyspnea","management of outbreaks","acute respiratory infections","fever","sputum","cough","electronic medical record","Timely information","BACKGROUND","replicable strategy","performance gains","kappa score","CONCLUSION","METHODS","custom coding","provider","hospital","resources","influenza","home","sensitivities"],"language":"en"},

However, drug design targeting IDPs is still in the very early stages. Progress in drug design is usually achieved using experimental screening; however, the structural disorder of IDPs makes it difficult to characterize their interaction with ligands using experiments alone. To better understand the structure of IDPs and their interactions with small molecule ligands, we performed extensive simulations on the c-Myc(370\u2013409) peptide and its binding to a reported small molecule inhibitor, ligand 10074-A4. We found that the conformational space of the apo c-Myc(370\u2013409) peptide was rather dispersed and that the conformations of the peptide were stabilized mainly by charge interactions and hydrogen bonds. Under the binding of the ligand, c-Myc(370\u2013409) remained disordered. The ligand was found to bind to c-Myc(370\u2013409) at different sites along the chain and behaved like a \u2018ligand cloud\u2019. In contrast to ligand binding to more rigid target proteins that usually results in a dominant bound structure, ligand binding to IDPs may better be described as ligand clouds around protein clouds. Nevertheless, the binding of the ligand and a non-ligand to the c-Myc(370\u2013409) target could be clearly distinguished. The present study provides insights that will help improve rational drug design that targets IDPs.","publish_time":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Fan; Yu, Chen; Lai, Luhua; Liu, Zhirong","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cabe96ceeaf4de3ad158c2579936a1ff3dfa352d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3789766.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3789766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDPs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ligand binding","ligand clouds","non-ligand","structure of IDPs","drug design targeting IDPs","apo c-Myc","rational drug design","peptide","potential drug design targets","structural disorder of IDPs","small molecule ligands","disordered proteins","rigid target proteins","reported small molecule inhibitor","charge interactions","protein clouds","dominant bound structure","extensive simulations","insights","experimental screening","conformational space","hydrogen bonds","chain","A4","contrast","human diseases","different sites","present study","experiments","conformations","Progress","early stages"],"language":"en"},

Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), caused by viruses within human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), is a severe, ocular surface infection associated with corneal inflammation. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has previously been shown to play a critical role in entry of other HAdV species into many host cell types. However, HAdV-D endocytosis into corneal cells has not been extensively studied. Herein, we show an essential role for cholesterol rich, lipid raft microdomains and caveolin-1, in the entry of HAdV-D37 into primary human corneal fibroblasts. Cholesterol depletion using methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD) profoundly reduced viral infection. When replenished with soluble cholesterol, the effect of M\u03B2CD was reversed, allowing productive viral infection. HAdV-D37 DNA was identified in caveolin-1 rich endosomal fractions after infection. Src kinase activity was also increased in caveolin-1 rich endosomal fractions after infection, and Src phosphorylation and CXCL1 induction were both decreased in caveolin-1-/- mice corneas compared to wild type mice. siRNA knock down of caveolin-1 in corneal cells reduced chemokine induction upon viral infection, and caveolin-1-/- mouse corneas showed reduced cellular entry of HAdV-D37. As a control, HAdV-C2, a non-corneal pathogen, appeared to utilize the caveolar pathway for entry into A549 cells, but failed to infect corneal cells entirely, indicating virus and cell specific tropism. Immuno-electron microscopy confirmed the presence of caveolin-1 in HAdV-D37-containing vesicles during the earliest stages of viral entry. Collectively, these experiments indicate for the first time that HAdV-D37 uses a lipid raft mediated caveolin-1 associated pathway for entry into corneal cells, and connects the processes of viral entry with downstream proinflammatory cell signaling.","publish_time":"2013-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yousuf, Mohammad A.; Zhou, Xiaohong; Mukherjee, Santanu; Chintakuntlawar, Ashish V.; Lee, Jeong Yoon; Ramke, Mirja; Chodosh, James; Rajaiya, Jaya","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fd0fccb43ad3cb1634370734ba27eaed2cf015a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3795695.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3795695/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["corneal cells","reduced cellular entry of HAdV","processes of viral entry","HAdV species","HAdV-C2","mediated caveolin","HAdV-D37 DNA","productive viral infection","HAdV-D endocytosis","presence of caveolin","earliest stages of viral entry","viral tropism","cellular entry of viruses","corneal inflammation","cholesterol rich","A549 cells","non-corneal pathogen","ocular surface infection","primary human corneal fibroblasts","rich endosomal fractions","human adenovirus species D","mice corneas","critical role","Cholesterol depletion","associated pathway","soluble cholesterol","cell specific tropism","lipid raft microdomains","downstream proinflammatory cell","host cell types","Clathrin-mediated endocytosis","caveolar pathway","CXCL1 induction","chemokine induction","mouse corneas","Src phosphorylation","effect of M\u03B2CD","essential role","wild type mice","critical area of study","Src kinase activity","methyl-\u03B2","cyclodextrin","vesicles","nature","Immuno-electron microscopy","immune response","EKC","time","Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis","control","experiments","siRNA"],"language":"en"},

In 2009, the California Department of Public Health reported a dramatic increase (350) in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in Humboldt County. To better understand the evolution of rabies, deep-sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the Humboldt outbreak. For each sample, approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Average coverage was 17,448 and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths. Phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date (1995 vs. 2009) and geographic location (northern vs. southern). A single amino acid change in the G protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks, suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region. Deep-sequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 20032010 were present at the sub-consensus level (as rare variants in the viral population) in skunk and fox samples from 1995. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change.","publish_time":"2013-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borucki, Monica K.; Chen-Harris, Haiyin; Lao, Victoria; Vanier, Gilda; Wadford, Debra A.; Messenger, Sharon; Allen, Jonathan E.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3836733.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["California Department of Public Health","Illumina"],"locations":["Humboldt"],"keyphrases":["rabies virus population present","fox rabies samples","unpassaged rabies virus samples","rabies virus variant","viral population","evolution of rabies","fox samples","deep sequencing","analysis of rare variants","Deep-sequencing data","haplotype present","subset of northern foxes","role of viral quasispecies","consensus sequences of skunk","consensus sequence data","Humboldt outbreak","number of gray foxes","RNA virus cross-species transmission","sub-consensus level","striped skunks","sampled outbreak","CST event","Phylogenetic analysis","Humboldt County","observed increased transmission","single amino acid change","G protein","allowed characterization","ancestral genomes","reservoir host","genetic changes","clues","order","California Department of Public Health","dramatic increase","need","events","unprecedented depths","small time scale","geographic location","nonsynonymous mutations","region","potential","results","Average coverage","hurdles","environment conditions","Illumina platform","date"],"language":"en"},

The ubiquity of mobile phones, which allow for short message service (SMS), provides new and innovative opportunities for disease prevention efforts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of SMS interventions for disease prevention in developing countries and provide recommendations for future work. METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed and gray literature was performed for papers published in English, French, and German before May 2011 that describe SMS applications for disease prevention in developing countries. RESULTS: A total of 34 SMS applications were described, among which 5 had findings of an evaluation reported. The majority of SMS applications were pilot projects in various levels of sophistication; nearly all came from gray literature sources. Many applications were initiated by the project with modes of intervention varying between one-way or two-way communication, with or without incentives, and with educative games. Evaluated interventions were well accepted by the beneficiaries. The primary barriers identified were language, timing of messages, mobile network fluctuations, lack of financial incentives, data privacy, and mobile phone turnover. CONCLUSION: This review illustrates that while many SMS applications for disease prevention exist, few have been evaluated. The dearth of peer-reviewed studies and the limited evidence found in this systematic review highlight the need for high-quality efficacy studies examining behavioral, social, and economic outcomes of SMS applications and mobile phone interventions aimed to promote health in developing country contexts.","publish_time":"2012-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00E9glise, Carole; Suggs, L.

It is therefore important to understand the full spectrum of GH signaling pathways and cellular responses. We applied mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics combined with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture to identify proteins rapidly phosphorylated in response to GH in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. We identified 132 phosphosites in 95 proteins that exhibited rapid (5 or 15 min) GH-dependent statistically significant increases in phosphorylation by more than or equal to 50% and 96 phosphosites in 46 proteins that were down-regulated by GH by more than or equal to 30%. Several of the GH-stimulated phosphorylation sites were known (e.g. regulatory Thr/Tyr in Erks 1 and 2, Tyr in signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 5a and 5b, Ser939 in tuberous sclerosis protein (TSC) 2 or tuberin). The remaining 126 GH-stimulated sites were not previously associated with GH. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of GH-stimulated sites indicated enrichment in proteins associated with the insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesions. Akt/protein kinase A consensus sites (RXRXXS/T) were the most commonly phosphorylated consensus sites. Immunoblotting confirmed GH-stimulated phosphorylation of all seven novel GH-dependent sites tested [regulatory sites in proline-rich Akt substrate, 40 kDA (PRAS40), regulatory associated protein of mTOR, ATP-citrate lyase, Na(\u002B)/H(\u002B) exchanger-1, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1, and Shc]). The immunoblot results suggest that many, if not most, of the GH-stimulated phosphosites identified in this large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis, including sites in multiple proteins in the Akt/ mTOR complex 1 pathway, are phosphorylated in response to GH. Their identification significantly broadens our thinking of GH-regulated cell functions.","publish_time":"2012-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ray, Bridgette N.; Kweon, Hye Kyong; Argetsinger, Lawrence S.; Fingar, Diane C.; Andrews, Philip C.; Carter-Su, Christin","journal":"Mol Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7ba62869caeb82ebe0dd98756082590d55c68fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3858665.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3858665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Thr/Tyr"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GH-stimulated sites","thinking of GH","spectrum of GH","GH receptors","GH-stimulated phosphorylation sites","GH-stimulated phosphosites","novel GH-dependent sites","confirmed GH-stimulated phosphorylation","regulatory sites","Genomes pathway analysis of GH","phosphorylated consensus sites","regulatory associated protein of mTOR","multiple proteins","protein kinase","regulatory Thr","pathways","mTOR complex","Tyr","regulated cell functions","regulated gene","tuberous sclerosis protein","large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis","proline-rich Akt substrate","cell culture","cellular responses","diverse range of responses","mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics","stable isotope","kDA","PRAS40","amino acids","mammalian target of rapamycin","ATP-citrate lyase","actin cytoskeleton","growth","TSC","Ser939","insulin","regulation","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","RXRXXS","enrichment","activators of transcription","signal transducers","Stat","N-myc","Erks","significant increases","life","3T3-F442A preadipocytes","exchanger","focal adhesions","altered metabolism","Shc","tuberin","identification","results"],"language":"en"},

CypA suppresses T-cell activation through cyclosporine (Cs) complexation and is required for effective HIV-1 replication in host cells. We show that CypA is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyl-lysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair to produce recombinant acetylated CypA in E. coli. We determine atomic resolution structures of acetylated CypA and its complexes with Cs and HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation dramatically inhibits CypA catalysis of cis to trans isomerisation and stabilises cis rather than trans forms of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, CypA acetylation antagonizes the immunosuppressive effects of Cs, by inhibiting the sequential steps of Cs binding and calcineurin inhibition. Our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of CypA in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function.","publish_time":"2010-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lammers, Michael; Neumann, Heinz; Chin, Jason W.; James, Leo C.","journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c7d8cb6fb3c98ee13aa0bcaae06298a65e0981cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2c02ce90332ef54570a97d203b9cc065075229d8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d64f060ffc5767039f12b4bd7260052f4f1e1e01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3867001.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3867001?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CypA acetylation","CypA catalysis of cis","recombinant acetylated CypA","key functions of CypA","atomic resolution structures of acetylated CypA","immunity","viral infection","immunosuppressive effects of Cs","cell function","effective HIV","capsid","sequential steps of Cs binding","T-cell activation","key roles","tRNA synthetase","trans isomerisation","diverse human cell lines","trans forms","ubiquitous cis-trans-prolyl isomerase","CUA","pair","evolved acetyl-lysyl","complexation","cyclosporine","complexes","general set of mechanisms","calcineurin inhibition","replication","interactions","host cells","results","coli","Cyclophilin"],"language":"en"},

The ongoing human outbreak of avian H7N9 in China highlights the need for increased surveillance and control in these live-bird markets (LBMs). DISCUSSION: Closure of retail markets in affected areas rapidly decreased human cases to rare, sporadic occurrence, but little attention has been paid thus far to the role of upstream elements of the poultry distribution chain such as wholesale markets. This could partly explain why transmission in poultry populations has not been eliminated more broadly. We present surveillance data from both wholesale live-bird markets (wLBMs) and rLBMs in Shantou, China (from 2004\u20132006), and call on disease-dynamic theory to illustrate why closing rLBMs has only minor effects on the overall volume of transmission. We show that the length of time birds stay in rLBMs can severely limit transmission there, but that the system-wide effect may be reduced substantially by high levels of transmission upstream of retail markets. SUMMARY: Management plans that minimize transmission throughout the entire poultry supply chain are essential for minimizing exposure to the public. These include reducing stay-time of birds in markets to 1 day, standardizing poultry supply chains to limit transmission in pre-retail settings, and monitoring strains with epidemiological traits that pose a high risk of emergence. These actions will further limit human exposure to extant viruses and reduce the likelihood of the emergence of novel strains by decreasing the overall volume of transmission.","publish_time":"2013-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pepin, Kim M; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Webb, Colleen T; Holcomb, Karen; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; Riley, Steven","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d23a5e1b6a5c6036c3e45e7c6d9019a59ddfd6bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3878446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["wholesale markets","live-bird markets","overall volume of transmission","Closure of retail markets","Live-animal markets","high levels of transmission","rLBMs","poultry populations","poultry distribution chain","human exposure","standardizing poultry supply chains","entire poultry supply chain","China","stay-time","decreased human cases","pre-retail settings","emergence of novel strains","high risk of emergence","length of time birds","monitoring strains","increased surveillance","important feature of meat distribution chains","ongoing human outbreak of avian H7N9","present surveillance data","role of upstream elements","affected areas","sporadic occurrence","need","control","day","epidemiological traits","likelihood","wLBMs","minor effects","maintenance","extant viruses","emergent zoonotic pathogens","little attention","Management plans","SUMMARY","Shantou","opportunity","BACKGROUND","DISCUSSION","disease-dynamic theory","system-wide effect","public","actions"],"language":"en"},

A disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) starting March, 2004. This report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision-making. METHODS: Between June 2003 and March 2004, after comparing various surveillance systems used around the world and consulting with ED physicians, pediatricians and internal medicine physicians involved in infectious disease control, the Syndromic Surveillance Research Team in Taiwan worked with the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh to create Taiwan\u0027s ED-SSS. The system was evaluated by analyzing daily electronic ED data received in real-time from the 189 hospitals participating in this system between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005. RESULTS: Taiwan\u0027s ED-SSS identified winter and summer spikes in two syndrome groups: influenza-like illnesses and respiratory syndrome illnesses, while total numbers of ED visits were significantly higher on weekends, national holidays and the days of Chinese lunar new year than weekdays (p \u003C 0.001). It also identified increases in the upper, lower, and total gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome groups starting in November 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus-like infections coinciding with the two school semesters. Using ED-SSS for surveillance of influenza-like illnesses and enteroviruses-related infections has improved Taiwan\u0027s pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities. CONCLUSION: Taiwan\u0027s ED-SSS represents the first nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system ever established in Asia. The experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems. The system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration.","publish_time":"2008-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Shih, Fuh-Yuan Frank; Yen, Muh-Yong; Wu, Jiunn-Shyan Julian; Lu, Shiou-Wen; Chang, Kevin Chi-Ming; Hsiung, Chao; Chou, Jr-How; Chu, Yu-Tseng; Chang, Hang; Chiu, Chan-Hsien; Tsui, Fu-Chiang Richard; Wagner, Michael M; Su, Ih-Jen; King, Chwan-Chuen","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63f04bb7051a4d43795615877a0a351ca5d79740.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2249581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2249581/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ED","Syndromic Surveillance Research Team"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["Taiwan\u0027s ED-SSS","ED physicians","surveillance of influenza","disease surveillance team","developing ED-SSS","various surveillance systems","nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system","electronic ED data","Syndromic Surveillance Research Team","infectious disease control","total numbers of ED visits","better global surveillance of infectious diseases","disease control capabilities","syndrome groups","Real-time Outbreak","respiratory syndrome illnesses","emerging infectious diseases","Taiwan-CDC","early outbreak detection systems","public health decision-making","improved Taiwan\u0027s pandemic flu preparedness","international concern","summer spikes","emergency care","international collaboration","hospitals responsible","clear spikes","patient data","internal medicine physicians","enteroviruses-related infections","hospital emergency department","EID","days of Chinese lunar new year","weekends","country","pediatricians","RODS","world","winter","national holidays","language environments","bioterrorist attacks","weekdays","Laboratory","steps","consulting","Centers","University of Pittsburgh","challenges","timely information","BACKGROUND","countries","Asia","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","increases","report","school semesters","experiences","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Production of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong AOX1 promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol. Optimization of processes using the AOX1 promoter in P. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed-batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon/energy starvation. The development of feeding protocols and the study of AOX1-controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks, although shake flasks have very limited possibilities for measurement and control. RESULTS: By applying on-line pO(2 )monitoring we demonstrate that the widely used pulse feeding of methanol results in long phases of methanol exhaustion and consequently low expression of AOX1 controlled genes. Furthermore, we provide a solution to apply the fed-batch strategy in shake flasks. The presented solution applies a wireless feeding unit which can be flexibly positioned and allows the use of computer-controlled feeding profiles. By using the human collagen II as an example we show that a quasi-continuous feeding profile, being the simplest way of a fed-batch fermentation, results in a higher production level of human collagen II. Moreover, the product has a higher proteolytic stability compared to control cultures due to the increased expression of human collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase as monitored by mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: The recommended standard protocol for methanol addition in shake flasks using pulse feeding is non-optimal and leads to repeated long phases of methanol starvation. The problem can be solved by applying the fed-batch technology. The presented wireless feeding unit, together with an on-line monitoring system offers a flexible, simple, and low-cost solution for initial optimization of the production in shake flasks which can be performed in parallel. By this way the fed-batch strategy can be applied from the early screening steps also in laboratories which do not have access to high-cost and complicated bioreactor systems.","publish_time":"2008-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruottinen, Maria; Bollok, Monika; K\u00F6gler, Martin; Neubauer, Antje; Krause, Mirja; H\u00E4m\u00E4l\u00E4inen, Eija-Riitta; Myllyharju, Johanna; Vasala, Antti; Neubauer, Peter","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e7e8aa9e5d952e8486bc9599764a9fcddd7f579.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2315644.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2315644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shake flasks","methanol addition","methanol results","pulse feeding","methanol toxification","controlled continuous addition of methanol","fed-batch fermentation","controlled feeding profiles","fed-batch strategy","fed-batch technology","example of production","presented wireless feeding unit","higher production level of human collagen","long phases of methanol exhaustion","recombinant protein production","presented solution","development of feeding protocols","repeated long phases of methanol starvation","quasi-continuous feeding profile","Production of recombinant proteins","low expression of AOX1 controlled genes","increased expression of human collagen prolyl","study of AOX1","low-cost solution","optimization of Pichia pastoris","strong AOX1 promoter","initial optimization","control cultures","gene expression","Optimization of processes","new technical solution","stable human type","on-line monitoring system","flask cultures","simplest way","energy starvation","protein levels","on-line pO","higher proteolytic stability","recommended standard protocol","high-cost","hydroxylase","carbon","complicated bioreactor systems","laboratories","access","limited possibilities","measurement","use of computer","early screening steps","CONCLUSION","mRNA","bioreactors","BACKGROUND","problem"],"language":"en"},

Lymphocytedeficient hosts often die of acute infection, presumably owing to their lack of an adaptive immune response to effectively clear pathogens. However, we show here that an unleashed innate immune response due to the absence of residential T cells can also be a direct cause of death. Viral infection or administration of poly(I:C), a ligand for TLR3, led to cytokine storm in T-cell- or lymphocyte-deficient mice in a fashion dependent on NK cells and tumor necrosis factor. We have further shown, through the depletion of CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) cells in wild-type mice and the transfer of T lymphocytes into Rag-1\u2013deficient mice, respectively, that T cells are both necessary and sufficient to temper the early innate response.

It is well accepted that a breakdown of the normally impermeant epithelial barrier of the intestine, the lung, and the kidney is associated with the development of inflammatory disease in these organs, yet significant controversy exists as to how this breakdown actually occurs, and how such a breakdown may lead to inflammation. In this regard, much work has focused upon the role of the epithelium as an \u201Cinnocent bystander,\u201D a target of a leukocyte-mediated inflammatory cascade that leads to its destruction in the mucosal inflammatory process. However, recent evidence from a variety of laboratories indicates that the epithelium is not merely a passive component in the steps that lead to mucosal inflammation, but is a central participant in the process. In addressing this controversy, we and others have determined that epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, and that activation of TLRs by endogenous and exogenous ligands may play a central role in determining the balance between a state of \u201Cmucosal homeostasis,\u201D as is required for optimal organ function, and \u201Cmucosal injury,\u201D leading to mucosal inflammation and barrier breakdown. In particular, activation of TLRs within intestinal epithelial cells leads to the development of cellular injury and impairment in mucosal repair in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, while activation of TLRs in the lung and kidney may participate in the development of pneumonitis and nephritis respectively. Recent work in support of these concepts is extensively reviewed, while essential areas of further study that are required to determine the significance of epithelial TLR signaling during states of health and disease are outlined.","publish_time":"2008-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gribar, Steven C; Richardson, Ward M; Sodhi, Chhinder P; Hackam, David J","journal":"Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/315ec823ef271418d0855dc665c0d44341dfcc95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2435494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2435494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucosal injury","Diseases of mucosal inflammation","mucosal repair","mucosal homeostasis","mucosal inflammatory process","activation of TLRs","development of inflammatory disease","barrier breakdown","intestinal epithelial cells","pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation","development of pneumonitis","development of cellular injury","impermeant epithelial barrier","epithelial cells express Toll","significance of epithelial TLR","epithelium","central role","inflammatory cascade","lung","Recent work","kidney","central participant","recent evidence","significant controversy","receptors","impairment","important causes of morbidity","exogenous ligands","organs","destruction","innate immune system","states of health","mortality","target","factors","concepts","variety of laboratories","intestine","balance","steps","optimal organ function","intense research efforts","innocent bystander","passive component","leukocyte","support","essential areas","study","nephritis","regard"],"language":"en"},

When historical data are absent (that is, the overwhelming majority), viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence. Currently, researchers use two strategies to approach this task, both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock assumption of substitution rate. As the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable, we present a simple method that estimates rates of substitution, and from there, times of divergence, without use of an assumed molecular clock. We accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype, providing a zeroth-order approximation for the rate between subtypes. As an example, we calculate the time of divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B using subtype C as an outgroup. We show a time of divergence approximately 100 years ago, substantially more recent than previous estimates which range from 250 to 3800 years ago.","publish_time":"2008-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Brien, John D; She, Zhen-Su; Suchard, Marc A","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/341a9a57e865081e81a9c60b97802773761ce8c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2443812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2443812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time of divergence","time of subtype divergence","rate of substitution","times of subtype divergence","times of divergence","substitution rate process","Precise dating of viral subtype divergence","molecular clock assumption of substitution rate","rates of substitution","subtype C","distinct viral subtype","viral sequence sampling","time scale commensurate","researchers","previous estimates","years","assumed molecular clock","influenza subtypes","H3N2","triplets of dated sequences","strong conditions","genes","inference","overwhelming majority","simple method","underlying structure","order approximation","task","outgroup","demographic occurrences","historical data","strategies","example"],"language":"en"},

Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria, or LPS) has been implicated as a major cause of this syndrome. Inflammatory shock as a consequence of LPS release remains a serious clinical concern. In humans, inflammatory responses to LPS result in the release of cytokines and other cell mediators from monocytes and macrophages, which can cause fever, shock, organ failure and death. A number of different approaches have been investigated to try to treat and/or prevent the septic shock associated with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including blockage of one or more of the cytokines induced by LPS. Recently several novel amphipathic compounds have been developed as direct LPS antagonists at the LPS receptor, TLR4.

The sessions focused on the role of these medications in selected resource poor settings in Africa and Asia now that access to anti-retroviral therapy is increasing.

Further, long-lasting protective immunity was generated by oral live virus vaccination. Systemic vaccination with the MNV capsid protein also effectively protected against mucosal challenge, while vaccination with the capsid protein of the distantly related human Lordsdale virus provided partial protection. Fully effective vaccination required a broad immune response including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells, but the importance of specific immune cell types varied between the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes. Perforin, but not interferon gamma, was required for clearance of MNV infection by adoptively transferred T lymphocytes from vaccinated hosts.

A small frequency of CD4 T cells specific for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against influenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors.

Homology-based 3D structure modeling reveals that the novel mutations are preferentially located at the protein surface and do not interfere with the active site. The latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors: oseltamivir (Tamiflu(\u00AE)), zanamivir (Relenza(\u00AE)) and peramivir; thus, the drugs should remain effective for treatment. However, the antigenic regions of the neuraminidase relevant for vaccine development, serological typing and passive antibody treatment can differ from those of previous strains and already vary among patients.

Most influenza A diagnostic assays currently utilized in local clinical laboratories do not allow definitive subtype determination. Detailed subtype analysis of influenza A positive samples in our laboratory allowed early confirmation of a large outbreak of S-OIV in southeastern Wisconsin (SEW). The initial case of S-OIV in SEW was detected on 28 April 2009. All influenza A samples obtained during the 16 week period prior to 28 April 2009, and the first four weeks of the subsequent epidemic were sub typed. Four different multiplex assays were employed, utilizing real time PCR and end point PCR to fully subtype human and animal influenza viral components. Specific detection of S-OIV was developed within days. Data regarding patient demographics and other concurrently circulating viruses were analyzed. During the first four weeks of the epidemic, 679 of 3726 (18.2%) adults and children tested for influenza A were identified with S-OIV infection. Thirteen patients (0.34%) tested positive for seasonal human subtypes of influenza A during the first two weeks and none in the subsequent 2 weeks of the epidemic. Parainfluenza viruses were the most prevalent seasonal viral agents circulating during the epidemic (of those tested), with detection rates of 12% followed by influenza B and RSV at 1.9% and 0.9% respectively. S-OIV was confirmed on day 2 of instituting subtype testing and within 4 days of report of national cases of S-OIV. Novel surge capacity diagnostic infrastructure exists in many specialty and research laboratories around the world. The capacity for broader influenza A sub typing at the local laboratory level allows timely and accurate detection of novel strains as they emerge in the community, despite the presence of other circulating viruses producing identical illness. This is likely to become increasingly important given the need for appropriate subtype driven anti-viral therapy and the potential shortage of such medications in a large epidemic.","publish_time":"2009-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Swati; Chusid, Michael J.; Willoughby, Rodney E.; Havens, Peter L.; Kehl, Sue C.; Ledeboer, Nathan A.; Li, Shun-Hwa; Henrickson, Kelly J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbb6c05b33f1411f6285604e1cfc1488ac898b26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2768288.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["United States","Wisconsin"],"keyphrases":["broader influenza","influenza B","S-OIV infection","Detailed subtype analysis of influenza","weeks","Specific detection of S","animal influenza viral components","seasonal human subtypes of influenza","novel swine origin influenza","large epidemic","subsequent epidemic","large outbreak of S","national cases of S","appropriate subtype","initial case of S","circulating viruses","instituting subtype testing","definitive subtype determination","positive samples","diagnostic assays","accurate detection of novel strains","Parainfluenza viruses","detection rates","Novel surge capacity diagnostic infrastructure","prevalent seasonal viral agents","anti-viral therapy","local laboratory level","local clinical laboratories","research laboratories","days of report","real time PCR","end point PCR","different multiplex assays","specialty","early confirmation","potential shortage","need","presence","medications","identical illness","southeastern Wisconsin","world","patient demographics","United States","Data","community","week period","adults","children","RSV","patients"],"language":"en"},

Factors such as the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals and hence appear as important population risk factors for FIV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To study such population risk factors, we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern France. We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sex-ratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is that, in host-parasite systems in general, fluctuations due to stochasticity in the transmission process are naturally very large and may alone explain a larger part of the variability in observed disease prevalence between populations than previously expected. Finally, we determined confidence intervals for the simple model parameters that can be used to further aid in management of the disease.","publish_time":"2009-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fouchet, David; Leblanc, Guillaume; Sauvage, Frank; Guiserix, Micheline; Poulet, Herv\u00E9; Pontier, Dominique","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/600e8fba699669f496224f1ab80caa3df030a77a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2770169.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770169/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["important population risk factors","natural cat populations","key social factors of cat populations","FIV prevalence","present data","number of males","mean age of males","density of cats","sex-ratio","females","individuals","CONCLUSION","infective status data","observed disease prevalence","simple model parameters","strong effects","transmission process","study area","female transmission rate","Feline Immunodeficiency Virus","fluctuations","variability","structured dynamic stochastic models","host-parasite systems","stochasticity","confidence intervals","frequency of fight","problem of dependence","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","northeastern France","BACKGROUND","multiple tests","METHODOLOGY","reality","aid","management","bites"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We immortalized IgG(\u002B) memory B cells from individuals infected with diverse clades of HIV-1 and selected on the basis of plasma neutralization profiles that were cross-clade and relatively potent. Culture supernatants were screened using various recombinant forms of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) in multiple parallel assays. We isolated 58 mAbs that were mapped to different Env surfaces, most of which showed neutralizing activity. One mAb in particular (HJ16) specific for a novel epitope proximal to the CD4 binding site on gp120 selectively neutralized a multi-clade panel of Tier-2 HIV-1 pseudoviruses, and demonstrated reactivity that was comparable in breadth, but distinct in neutralization specificity, to that of the other CD4 binding site-specific neutralizing mAb b12. A second mAb (HGN194) bound a conserved epitope in the V3 crown and neutralized all Tier-1 and a proportion of Tier-2 pseudoviruses tested, irrespective of clade. A third mAb (HK20) with broad neutralizing activity, particularly as a Fab fragment, recognized a highly conserved epitope in the HR-1 region of gp41, but showed striking assay-dependent selectivity in its activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that by using appropriate screening methods, a large proportion of memory B cells can be isolated that produce mAbs with HIV-1 neutralizing activity. Three of these mAbs show unusual breadth of neutralization and therefore add to the current panel of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies with potential for passive protection and template-based vaccine design.","publish_time":"2010-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corti, Davide; Langedijk, Johannes P.

Virus particles lacking gB, gD, gH or gL are entry-defective, although these viruses retain the ability to bind to the plasma membrane via the remaining glycoproteins. Soluble forms of gD have been shown to trigger the nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03BAB transcriptional complex in addition to stimulating the production of Type I interferon. By taking advantage of the entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein-deficient HSV-1 virus particles, the results presented here show that binding of virions to cellular receptors on the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a change in cellular gene expression. Preliminary microarray studies, validated by quantitative real-time PCR, identified the differential expression of cellular genes associated with the NF-\u03BAB, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat and related Jak/Src pathways by virions lacking gB or gH but not gD. Gene induction occurred at a few particles per cell, corresponding to physiological conditions during primary infection. Reporter assay studies determined that NF-\u03BAB transcriptional activity is stimulated within an hour of HSV-1 binding, peaks between two and three hours post-binding and declines to background levels by five hours after induction. The immediate, transient nature of these signalling events suggests that HSV-1 glycoproteins, particularly gD, may alter the cellular environment pre-entry so as to condition the cell for viral replication.","publish_time":"2010-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacLeod, Iain J.; Minson, Tony","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f72764a9a0f911eb892cf04752566d6ef4ee54c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2832691.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus entry","Virus particles","cellular gene expression","cellular receptors","deficient HSV","binding of virions","cellular environment pre-entry","hour of HSV","envelope of HSV","NF-\u03BAB transcriptional complex","NF-\u03BAB transcriptional activity","gB","gH","entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein","differential expression of cellular genes","plasma membrane","hours post-binding","Soluble forms of gD","remaining glycoproteins","number of glycoproteins","Gene induction","related Jak","Preliminary microarray studies","Reporter assay studies","Stat","Src pathways","addition","Akt","quantitative real-time PCR","signalling events","PI3K","change","physiological conditions","transient nature","levels","peaks","production of Type","nuclear translocation","primary infection","ability","viruses","advantage","results","interferon","viral replication"],"language":"en"},

We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics. These results have implications for the design of control strategies.","publish_time":"2010-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salath\u00E9, Marcel; Jones, James H.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/476c677579fa461c4fbe5822f1df9a687a6d8928.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2851561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strong community structure","structure of relevant contact networks","marked patterns of community structure","simulated networks","Human contact networks","Social networks","spread of disease","disease dynamics","spread of infectious diseases","underlying host contact network","dynamics of infectious diseases","immunization interventions","communities","available network information","results","vaccine supply","optimal control strategies","non-pharmaceutical interventions","design of control strategies","major impact","direct person","person transmission","existing algorithms","simulated data","connected individuals","efficient vaccination algorithms","successful immunization intervention","major goal of public health","influenza","insights","smallpox","great need","targets","implications","HIV","AIDS","epidemics","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three genomic BAC clones containing the human CEACAM1 gene were microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized FVB mouse oocytes. The embryos were implanted in the oviducts of pseudopregnant females and allowed to develop to term. DNA from newborn mice was evaluated by PCR for the presence of the human CEACAM1 gene. Feces of the PCR positive offspring screened for expression of human CEACAM1. Using this assay, one out of five PCR positive lines was positive for human CEACAM1 expression and showed stable transmission to the F1 generation with the expected transmission frequency (0.5) for heterozygotes. Liver, lung, intestine, kidney, mammary gland, and prostate were strongly positive for the dual expression of both murine and human CEACAM1 and mimic that seen in human tissue. Peripheral blood and bone marrow granulocytes stained strongly for human CEACAM1 and bound Neisseria Opa proteins similar to that in human neutrophils.

Each patient underwent an evaluation to determine detailed clinical and radiological features. RESULTS: All patients presented with high fever (\u003E 38.0\u2103), with accompanying symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) values with no leukocytosis nor elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

MPs have different biological effects depending on the cell from they originate. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways, their activation and eventually apoptosis. We investigated on the presence and phenotype of MPs in the sputum, a rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers, of acute and stable CF adult patients. METHODS: Spontaneous sputum, obtained from 21 CF patients (10 acute and 11 stable) and 7 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), was liquefied with Sputasol. MPs were counted, visualized by electron microscopy, and identified in the supernatants of treated sputum by cytofluorimetry and immunolabelling for leukocyte (CD11a), granulocyte (CD66b), and monocyte-macrophage (CD11b) antigens. RESULTS: Electron microscopy revealed that sputum MPs were in the 100-500 nm range and did not contain bacteria, confirming microbiological tests. CF sputa contained higher number of MPs in comparison with PCD sputa. Levels of CD11a(\u002B)-and CD66b(\u002B)-, but not CD11b(\u002B)-MPs were significantly higher in CF than in PCD, without differences between acute and stable patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, MPs are detectable in sputa obtained from CF patients and are predominantly of granulocyte origin. This novel isolation method for MPs from sputum opens a new opportunity for the study of lung pathology in CF.","publish_time":"2010-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porro, Chiara; Lepore, Silvia; Trotta, Teresa; Castellani, Stefano; Ratclif, Luigi; Battaglino, Anna; Di Gioia, Sante; Mart\u00EDnez, Maria C; Conese, Massimo; Maffione, Angela B","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/197ed79a4d416e8ae496faad41823751e15739ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2910006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sputum MPs","CF patients","phenotype of MPs","CF sputa","stable patients","higher number of MPs","stable CF adult patients","Spontaneous sputum","PCD sputa","supernatants of treated sputum","cell activation","granulocyte origin","electron microscopy","apoptosis","CD66b","CD11b","lung disease","massive neutrophil granulocyte influx","Levels of CD11a","study of lung pathology","cytofluorimetry","airways","rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers","membrane vesicles","new opportunity","immunolabelling","leukocyte","comparison","differences","monocyte-macrophage","primary ciliary dyskinesia","bacteria","Microparticles","Cystic fibrosis","different biological effects","summary","novel isolation method","antigens","RESULTS","nm range","microbiological tests","METHODS","presence","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Sputasol"],"language":"en"},

There are reports of poorer patient outcome in transplant candidates with high MELD score, others though report no influence of MELD score on outcome and survival. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 144 consecutive liver transplant recipients over a 72-month period in our transplant unit, from January 2003 until December 2008 and performed uni- and multivariate analysis for morbidity and mortality, in particular to define the influence of MELD to these parameters. RESULTS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by intensive care unit (ICU) stay longer than 10 days (odds ratio 7.0) but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. Furthermore, we identified transfusion of more than 7 units of red blood cells as independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 7.6) and for prolonged ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] 7.8) together with transfusion of more than 10 units of fresh frozen plasma (OR 11.6). Postoperative renal failure is a strong predictor of morbidity (OR 7.9) and postoperative renal replacement therapy was highly associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio 6.8), as was hepato renal syndrome prior to transplantation (hazard ratio 13.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by ICU stay longer than 10 days but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. This finding supports the transplantation of patients with high MELD score but only with knowledge of increased morbidity.","publish_time":"2010-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oberkofler, Christian E; Dutkowski, Philipp; Stocker, Reto; Schuepbach, Reto A; Stover, John F; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; B\u00E9chir, Markus","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac7842dd7a78a32daf150fb200ef6dafc84d9d8b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2911764.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2911764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high MELD score","influence of MELD score","postoperative morbidity","hazard ratio","increased mortality","independent risk factor of morbidity","odds ratio","knowledge of increased morbidity","strong predictor of morbidity","transplant unit","negative impact","Postoperative renal failure","transplant candidates","postoperative renal replacement therapy","contrast","impact of model","prolonged ICU","study","days","transfusion","consecutive liver transplant recipients","hepato renal syndrome","transplantation of patients","poorer patient outcome","intensive care unit","end stage liver disease","units of red blood cells","units of fresh frozen plasma","data","month period","multivariate analysis","survival","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","parameters","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

By performing two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys during winter 2009 and winter 2010 among European travellers to resource-limited destinations, we aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding seasonal influenza vaccination. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed in the waiting room to the visitors of the University of Zurich Centre for Travel\u0027 Health (CTH) in January and February 2009 and January 2010 prior to travel health counselling (CTH09 and CTH10). Questions included demographic data, travel-related characteristics and KAP regarding influenza vaccination. Data were analysed by using SPSS(\u00AE )version 14.0 for Windows. Differences in proportions were compared using the Chi-square test and the significance level was set at p \u2264 0.05. Predictors for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination were determined by multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: With a response rate of 96.6%, 906 individuals were enrolled and 868 (92.5%) provided complete data. Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was 13.7% (n = 119). Only 43 (14.2%) participants were vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1, mostly having received both vaccines simultaneously, the seasonal and pandemic one. Job-related purposes (44, 37%), age \u003E 64 yrs (25, 21%) and recommendations of the family physician (27, 22.7%) were the most often reported reasons for being vaccinated. In the multiple logistic regression analyses of the pooled data increasing age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.04), a business trip (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 - 0.92) and seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous winter seasons (OR = 12.91, 95% CI 8.09 - 20.58) were independent predictors for seasonal influenza vaccination in 2009 or 2010. Influenza vaccination recommended by the family doctor (327, 37.7%), travel to regions with known high risk of influenza (305, 35.1%), and influenza vaccination required for job purposes (233, 26.8%) were most frequently mentioned to consider influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception and vaccination coverage concerning seasonal and pandemic influenza was very poor among travellers to resource-limited destinations when compared to traditional at-risk groups. Previous access to influenza vaccination substantially facilitated vaccinations in the subsequent year. Information strategies about influenza should be intensified and include health professionals, e.g. family physicians, travel medicine practitioners and business enterprises.","publish_time":"2010-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfeil, Alena; M\u00FCtsch, Margot; Hatz, Christoph; Szucs, Thomas D","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8c10a96009eb0ba293228a5cc766e8747407945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2912811.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912811/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza vaccination","Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage","known high risk of influenza","travel health counselling","pooled data","demographic data","complete data","travel-related characteristics","travel medicine practitioners","KAP","European travellers","resource-limited destinations","previous winter seasons","multiple logistic regression analyses","family physicians","health professionals","family doctor","Risk perception","independent predictors","Previous access","business enterprises","business trip","job purposes","Job-related purposes","University of Zurich Centre","visitors","vaccinations","regions","practices","common vaccine-preventable diseases","significance level","Chi-square test","knowledge","CTH09","CTH10","CONCLUSIONS","traditional at-risk groups","cross-sectional questionnaire surveys","waiting room","Questionnaires","proportions","attitudes","recommendations","Questions","vaccines","H1N1","response rate","subsequent year","version","individuals","RESULTS","yrs","SPSS","Information strategies","participants","Windows","METHODS","Differences","BACKGROUND","reasons"],"language":"en"},

Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if [Image: see text] or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kubiak, Ruben J.; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; McLean, Angela R.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/303dd57924047b30670081699eb8c991bf0f41b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2947978.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2947978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probability of emergence","risk of emergence","chances of emergence","effects of spatial heterogeneity","successful emergence event","general analytical results","statistical properties of emergence events","sustained human","outbreak size distributions","probability distribution of outbreak sizes","human transmission","human population","analytical expressions","introduction","different adaptation scenarios","sporadic infections","evolutionary biology of host adaptation","empirical data","large city","vast majority of communities","control of emerging infections","particular reference","humans","weak effect","typical connection strengths","novel infectious diseases","simple mathematical models","commuting patterns","waiting time","village","surveillance","plausible parameter ranges","key factor","restricted outbreaks","Image","influenza","text","implications","commuters","stochastic model","day","example","H5N1"],"language":"en"},

Antibiotics may provide little immediate relief to patients who have a high bacteremia or to patients infected with an antibiotic resistant strain of plague. Two virulent factors of Y. pestis are the capsid F1 protein and the low-calcium response (Lcr) V-protein or V-antigen that have been proven to be the targets for both active and passive immunization. There are mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the F1- and V-antigens that can passively protect mice in a murine model of plague; however, there are no anti-Yersinia pestis monoclonal antibodies available for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in humans. We identified one anti-F1-specific human mAb (m252) and two anti-V-specific human mAb (m253, m254) by panning a na\u00EFve phage-displayed Fab library against the F1- and V-antigens. The Fabs were converted to IgG1s and their binding and protective activities were evaluated. M252 bound weakly to peptides located at the F1 N-terminus where a protective mouse anti-F1 mAb also binds. M253 bound strongly to a V-antigen peptide indicating a linear epitope; m254 did not bind to any peptide from a panel of 53 peptides suggesting that its epitope may be conformational. M252 showed better protection than m253 and m254 against a Y, pestis challenge in a plague mouse model. A synergistic effect was observed when the three antibodies were combined. Incomplete to complete protection was achieved when m252 was given at different times post-challenge. These antibodies can be further studied to determine their potential as therapeutics or prophylactics in Y. pestis infection in humans.","publish_time":"2010-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xiaodong; Zhu, Zhongyu; Dankmeyer, Jennifer L.; Wormald, Michael M.; Fast, Randy L.; Worsham, Patricia L.; Cote, Christopher K.; Amemiya, Kei; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d298d793c2521ceebdcd2c4be960591032ae0d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2954148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2954148/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["V-protein","m252","V-antigens","protective mouse anti-F1 mAb","pestis challenge","anti-F1-specific human mAb","anti-V-specific human mAb","V-antigen peptide","m254","pestis infection","capsid F1 protein","anti-Yersinia pestis monoclonal antibodies available","m253","plague mouse model","F1 N-terminus","murine model of plague","patients","etiologic agent of plague","humans","peptides","antibiotic resistant strain of plague","protective activities","linear epitope","better protection","complete protection","different times post-challenge","low-calcium response","Lcr","therapeutic treatment","prophylactics","Fab library","little immediate relief","IgG1s","na\u00EFve phage","therapeutics","mice","high bacteremia","people","recorded history of mankind","targets","passive immunization","Antibiotics","binding","mAbs","virulent factors of","potential","panel","synergistic effect","Fabs"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to compare the short-term virological efficacy of oseltamivir-zanamivir combination versus each monotherapy plus placebo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial with 145 general practitioners throughout France during the 2008\u20132009 seasonal influenza epidemic. Patients, general practitioners, and outcome assessors were all blinded to treatment assignment. Adult outpatients presenting influenza-like illness for less than 36 hours and a positive influenza A rapid test diagnosis were randomized to oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily plus zanamivir 10 mg by inhalation twice daily (OZ), oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (O), or zanamivir plus oral placebo (Z). Treatment efficacy was assessed virologically according to the proportion of patients with nasal influenza reverse transcription (RT)-PCR below 200 copies genome equivalent (cgeq)/\u00B5l at day 2 (primary outcome), and clinically to the time to alleviation of symptoms until day 14. Overall 541 patients (of the 900 planned) were included (OZ, n = 192; O, n = 176; Z, n = 173), 49% male, mean age 39 years. In the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the 447 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A, 46%, 59%, and 34% in OZ (n = 157), O (n = 141), and Z (n = 149) arms had RT-PCR\u003C200 cgeq/\u00B5l (\u221213.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] \u221223.1 to \u22122.9, p = 0.025; \u002B12.3%, 95% CI 2.39\u201322.2, p = 0.028 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). Mean day 0 to day 2 viral load decrease was 2.14, 2.49, and 1.68 log(10) cgeq/\u00B5l (p = 0.060, p = 0.016 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Median time to alleviation of symptoms was 4.0, 3.0, and 4.0 days (\u002B1.0, 95% CI 0.0\u20134.0, p = 0.018; \u002B0.0, 95% CI \u22123.0 to 3.0, p = 0.960 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Four severe adverse events were observed. Nausea and/or vomiting tended to be more frequent in the combination arm (OZ, n = 13; O, n = 4; and Z, n = 5 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with seasonal influenza A mainly H3N2 virus infection, the oseltamivir-zanamivir combination appeared less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy, and not significantly more effective than zanamivir monotherapy. Despite the theoretical potential for the reduction of the emergence of antiviral resistance, the lower effectiveness of this combination calls for caution in its use in clinical practice.

Exposures varied by age at diagnosis, race, disease course and the presence of certain myositis autoantibodies. Conclusion. The JIIMs may be related to multiple exposures and these appear to vary among phenotypes.","publish_time":"2010-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rider, Lisa G.; Wu, Lan; Mamyrova, Gulnara; Targoff, Ira N.; Miller, Frederick W.","journal":"Rheumatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b55a0e31017b0b12cb2d82f0b23dfaf1d619528e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2981509.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article-pdf/49/12/2381/5065535/keq277.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["noted exposures","multiple exposures","Non-infectious exposures","diagnosis","Patients older","phenotypes","higher frequency of documented exposures","total number of reported exposures","cent of JIIM patients","illness onset","common exposure","recorded exposure","documented infections","medications","months","JIIMs","immunizations","presence of certain myositis autoantibodies","median age","definite JIIM","onset of juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies","certain environmental factors","anti-signal recognition particle autoantibodies","disease course","odds ratios","race","open-ended question","questionnaires","longer delay","laboratory measures","Physicians","stressful life events","Medical records","Objective","Methods","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We describe eight cases of H1N1 infection in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a referral cancer center. Patients and methods: Clinical data from all patients admitted with acute respiratory failure due to novel viral H1N1 infection were reviewed. Lung tissue was submitted for viral and bacteriological analyses by real-time RT-PCR, and autopsy was conducted on all patients who died. Results: Eight patients were admitted, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years old. There were five patients with solid organ tumors (62.5%) and three with hematological malignancies (37.5%). Five patients required mechanical ventilation and all died. Four patients had bacterial bronchopneumonia. All deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure. A milder form of lung disease was present in the three cases who survived. Lung tissue analysis was performed in all patients and showed diffuse alveolar damage in most patients. Other lung findings were necrotizing bronchiolitis or extensive hemorrhage.

However, a vaccination program\u0027s efficacy largely depends on population compliance. We examined general population decision-making for pH1N1 vaccination using a modified Theory of Planned Behaviour (TBP). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a longitudinal study, collecting data before and after the introduction of pH1N1 vaccine in Hong Kong. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested if a modified TPB had explanatory utility for vaccine uptake among adults. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 896 subjects who completed both the baseline and the follow-up surveys, 7% (67/896) reported being \u201Clikely/very likely/certain\u201D to be vaccinated (intent) but two months later only 0.8% (7/896) reported having received pH1N1 vaccination. Perception of low risk from pH1N1 (60%) and concerns regarding adverse effects of the vaccine (37%) were primary justifications for avoiding pH1N1 vaccination. Greater perceived vaccine benefits (\u03B2 = 0.15), less concerns regarding vaccine side-effects (\u03B2 = \u22120.20), greater adherence to social norms of vaccination (\u03B2 = 0.39), anticipated higher regret if not vaccinated (\u03B2 = 0.47), perceived higher self-efficacy for vaccination (\u03B2 = 0.12) and history of seasonal influenza vaccination (\u03B2 = 0.12) were associated with higher intention to receive the pH1N1 vaccine, which in turn predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (\u03B2 = 0.30). Social norm (\u03B2 = 0.70), anticipated regret (\u03B2 = 0.19) and vaccination intention (\u03B2 = 0.31) were positively associated with, and accounted for 70% of variance in vaccination planning, which, in turn subsequently predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (\u03B2 = 0.36) accounting for 36% of variance in reported vaccination behaviour. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Perceived low risk from pH1N1 and perceived high risk from pH1N1 vaccine inhibited pH1N1 vaccine uptake. Both the TPB and the additional components contributed to intended vaccination uptake but social norms and anticipated regret predominantly associated with vaccination intention and planning. Vaccination planning is a more significant proximal determinant of uptake of pH1N1 vaccine than is intention. Intention alone is an unreliable predictor of future vaccine uptake.","publish_time":"2011-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Lam, Wendy Wing Tak; Fielding, Richard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9791652bce8752738f1bfb75305fd5faa6e30374.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3055876.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TPB"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["pH1N1 vaccination","vaccination intention","vaccination planning","pH1N1 vaccine uptake","self-reported vaccination uptake","reported vaccination behaviour","introduction of pH1N1 vaccine","social norms of vaccination","vaccination program\u0027s efficacy","vaccine side-effects","history of seasonal influenza vaccination","Greater perceived vaccine benefits","unreliable predictor of future vaccine uptake","higher intention","Perceived low risk","higher regret","anticipated regret","perceived high risk","higher self-efficacy","significant proximal determinant of uptake","Perception of low risk","modified TPB","concerns","variance","turn","modified Theory of Planned Behaviour","greater adherence","population compliance","influenza pandemic","general population decision-making","explanatory utility","SEM","SIGNIFICANCE","core component","TBP","CONCLUSIONS","adults","Hong Kong","additional components","primary justifications","subjects","baseline","longitudinal study","Structural equation modeling","data","BACKGROUND","adverse effects","accounting","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","follow-up surveys","METHODOLOGY","months"],"language":"en"},

DENV is very diverse: there are four antigenic groups (serotypes) and three to five genetic groups (genotypes) within each serotype. Thus, it has been difficult to evaluate the relative virulence or transmissibility of each DENV genotype; both of these factors are important determinants of epidemiology and their measurement is complex because the natural cycle of this disease involves human-mosquito-human transmission. Although epidemiological and evolutionary studies have pointed to viral factors in determining disease outcome, only recently developed models could prove the importance of specific viral genotypes in causing severe epidemics and their potential to spread to other continents. These new models involve infection of primary human cell cultures, \u201Chumanized\u201D mice and field-collected mosquitoes; also, new mathematical models can estimate the impact of viral replication, human immunity and mosquito transmission on epidemic behavior. DENV evolution does not seem to be rapid and the transmission and dispersal of stable, replication-fit genotypes has been more important in the causation of more severe epidemics.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Influenza activity data from 2003\u201304 through 2007\u201308 were obtained from three US surveillance systems: Google Flu Trends, CDC Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (CDC ILI Surveillance), and US Influenza Virologic Surveillance System (CDC Virus Surveillance). Pearson\u0027s correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare surveillance data. An analysis was performed to investigate outlier observations and determine the extent to which they affected the correlations between surveillance data. Pearson\u0027s correlation coefficient describing Google Flu Trends and CDC Virus Surveillance over the study period was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.79). The correlation between CDC ILI Surveillance and CDC Virus Surveillance over the same period was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.89). Most of the outlier observations in both comparisons were from the 2003\u201304 influenza season. Exclusion of the outlier observations did not substantially improve the correlation between Google Flu Trends and CDC Virus Surveillance (0.82; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.87) or CDC ILI Surveillance and CDC Virus Surveillance (0.86; 95%CI: 0.82, 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that while Google Flu Trends is highly correlated with rates of ILI, it has a lower correlation with surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza. Most of the outlier observations occurred during the 2003\u201304 influenza season that was characterized by early and intense influenza activity, which potentially altered health care seeking behavior, physician testing practices, and internet search behavior.","publish_time":"2011-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ortiz, Justin R.; Zhou, Hong; Shay, David K.; Neuzil, Kathleen M.; Fowlkes, Ashley L.; Goss, Christopher H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47b84b720b0601da21090660ed223b7cfa1150cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3083406.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3083406/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["Google Flu Trends","ILI","CDC ILI","US Influenza Virologic Surveillance System","CDC Virus Surveillance"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CDC ILI Surveillance","CDC Virus Surveillance","surveillance data","CDC Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network","US surveillance systems","US Influenza Virologic Surveillance System","Google Flu Trends","influenza season","rates of ILI","Influenza activity data","actual influenza virus infections","outlier observations","intense influenza activity","lower correlation","Pearson\u0027s correlation coefficients","analysis","internet search behavior","internet searches","study period","physician testing practices","altered health care","illness","confidence intervals","METHODS","FINDINGS","laboratory","extent","correlations","BACKGROUND","comparisons","Exclusion","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The seroprevalence was recently estimated to be 10.2%. In this work we provide estimates of the transmission potential of the virus and we assess the efficacy of the measures undertaken by public health authorities to control the epidemic spread. To such aim, we developed a model describing the temporal dynamics of the competent vector, known as Aedes albopictus, explicitly depending on climatic factors, coupled to an epidemic transmission model describing the spread of the epidemic in both humans and mosquitoes. The cumulative number of notified cases predicted by the model was 185 on average (95% CI 117\u2013278), in good agreement with observed data. The probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an infective human case was estimated to be in the range of 32%\u201376%. We found that the basic reproduction number was in the range of 1.8\u20136 but it could have been even larger, depending on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn depends on seasonal meteorological effects, besides other local abiotic factors. These results confirm the increasing risk of tropical vector\u2013borne diseases in temperate climate countries, as a consequence of globalization.

As infection proceeds, the microtubule cytoskeleton becomes dramatically reorganized in a fashion reminiscent of overexpression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).

However, the fast PCR method suffers from many drawbacks such as a high false-positive rate and the ability to detect only one or a few gene targets at a time. Microarray technology solves the problems of the PCR limitations and can be effectively applied to all fields of molecular medicine. Recently, a report in Retrovirology described a multi-virus DNA array that contains more than 250 open reading frames from eight human viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1. This array can be used to detect multiple viral co-infections in cells and in vivo. Another benefit of this kind of multi-virus array is in studying promoter activity and viral gene expression and correlating such readouts with the progression of disease and reactivation of latent infections.

For example, detailed comparison of multiple isolates of the smallpox virus genome (each approximately 200 kb, with 200 genes) is not feasible without new bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: A software package, Base-By-Base, has been developed that provides visualization tools to enable researchers to 1) rapidly identify and correct alignment errors in large, multiple genome alignments; and 2) generate tabular and graphical output of differences between the genomes at the nucleotide level. Base-By-Base uses detailed annotation information about the aligned genomes and can list each predicted gene with nucleotide differences, display whether variations occur within promoter regions or coding regions and whether these changes result in amino acid substitutions. Base-By-Base can connect to our mySQL database (Virus Orthologous Clusters; VOCs) to retrieve detailed annotation information about the aligned genomes or use information from text files. CONCLUSION: Base-By-Base enables users to quickly and easily compare large viral genomes; it highlights small differences that may be responsible for important phenotypic differences such as virulence.

Many heterologous proteins have already been produced in L. lactis but only few reports allow comparing production yields for a given protein either produced intracellularly or secreted in the medium. Here, we review several works evaluating the influence of the localization on the production yields of several heterologous proteins produced in L. lactis. The questions of size limits, conformation, and proteolysis are addressed and discussed with regard to protein yields. These data show that i) secretion is preferable to cytoplasmic production; ii) secretion enhancement (by signal peptide and propeptide optimization) results in increased production yield; iii) protein conformation rather than protein size can impair secretion and thus alter production yields; and iv) fusion of a stable protein can stabilize labile proteins. The role of intracellular proteolysis on heterologous cytoplasmic proteins and precursors is discussed. The new challenges now are the development of food grade systems and the identification and optimization of host factors affecting heterologous protein production not only in L. lactis, but also in other LAB species.","publish_time":"2005-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le Loir, Yves; Azevedo, Vasco; Oliveira, Sergio C; Freitas, Daniela A; Miyoshi, Anderson; Berm\u00FAdez-Humar\u00E1n, Luis G; Nouaille, S\u00E9bastien; Ribeiro, Luciana A; Leclercq, Sophie; Gabriel, Jane E; Guimaraes, Valeria D; Oliveira, Maric\u00EA N; Charlier, Cathy; Gautier, Michel; Langella, Philippe","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d7400a2b387820cd391d7df8194642e50402a0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC545053.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC545053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heterologous protein production","protein yields","protein conformation","protein size","heterologous protein delivery","given protein","stable protein","protein producer","heterologous proteins","cytoplasmic production","comparing production yields","heterologous cytoplasmic proteins","Lactococcus lactis","increased production yield","labile proteins","secretion enhancement","propeptide optimization","development of food grade systems","LAB species","optimization of host factors","role of intracellular proteolysis","questions of size limits","model lactic acid bacterium","well-characterized Gram positive bacterium","results","signal peptide","identification","foodstuff","good candidate","localization","precursors","reports","fusion","influence","regard","digestive tract","new challenges","works","data","fermentor"],"language":"en"},

Direct sequence analysis of the pathogen, particularly at a population level, is generally thought to be too cumbersome, technically difficult, and expensive. We present here a novel application of mass spectrometry (MS)\u2013based technology in characterizing viral sequence variations that overcomes these problems, and we apply it retrospectively to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The success rate of the MS-based analysis for detecting SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) sequence variations was determined to be 95% with 75 copies of viral RNA per reaction, which is sufficient to directly analyze both clinical and cultured samples. Analysis of 13 SARS-CoV isolates from the different stages of the Singapore outbreak identified nine sequence variations that could define the molecular relationship between them and pointed to a new, previously unidentified, primary route of introduction of SARS-CoV into the Singapore population. Our direct determination of viral sequence variation from a clinical sample also clarified an unresolved epidemiological link regarding the acquisition of SARS in a German patient. We were also able to detect heterogeneous viral sequences in primary lung tissues, suggesting a possible coevolution of quasispecies of virus within a single host. CONCLUSION: This study has further demonstrated the importance of improving clinical and epidemiological studies of pathogen transmission through the use of genetic analysis and has revealed the MS-based analysis to be a sensitive and accurate method for characterizing SARS-CoV genetic variations in clinical samples. We suggest that this approach should be used routinely during outbreaks of a wide variety of agents, in order to allow the most effective control.","publish_time":"2005-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jianjun; Lim, Siew Lan; Ruan, Yijun; Ling, Ai Ee; Ng, Lisa F.

We evaluated the feasibility and potential benefits of a handheld computer based knowledge access system linking a central academic intensive care unit (ICU) to multiple community-based ICUs. METHODS: Four community hospital ICUs with 17 physicians participated in this prospective interventional study. Following training in the use of an internet-linked, updateable handheld computer knowledge access system, the physicians used the handheld devices in their clinical environment for a 12-month intervention period. Feasibility of the system was evaluated by tracking use of the handheld computer and by conducting surveys and focus group discussions. Before and after the intervention period, participants underwent simulated patient care scenarios designed to evaluate the information sources they accessed, as well as the speed and quality of their decision making. Participants generated admission orders during each scenario, which were scored by blinded evaluators. RESULTS: Ten physicians (59%) used the system regularly, predominantly for nonmedical applications (median 32.8/month, interquartile range [IQR] 28.3\u2013126.8), with medical software accessed less often (median 9/month, IQR 3.7\u201313.7). Eight out of 13 physicians (62%) who completed the final scenarios chose to use the handheld computer for information access. The median time to access information on the handheld handheld computer was 19 s (IQR 15\u201340 s). This group exhibited a significant improvement in admission order score as compared with those who used other resources (P = 0.018). Benefits and barriers to use of this technology were identified. CONCLUSION: An updateable handheld computer system is feasible as a means of point-of-care access to medical reference material and may improve clinical decision making. However, during the study, acceptance of the system was variable. Improved training and new technology may overcome some of the barriers we identified.","publish_time":"2004-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lapinsky, Stephen E; Wax, Randy; Showalter, Randy; Martinez-Motta, J Carlos; Hallett, David; Mehta, Sangeeta; Burry, Lisa; Stewart, Thomas E","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98a3b0606a67d829816c1d934e2d1a7196985151.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1065064.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1065064/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["handheld handheld computer","updateable handheld computer system","care access","updateable handheld computer knowledge access system","handheld devices","information access","immediate access","Critical care physicians","IQR","tracking use","medical reference material","month intervention period","simulated patient care scenarios","participants","clinical decision making","median time","medical software","information sources","feasibility","barriers","multiple community-based ICUs","community hospital ICUs","central academic intensive care unit","clinical environment","admission orders","final scenarios","potential benefits","new technology","Improved training","group discussions","admission order score","prospective interventional study","significant improvement","internet","means of point","interquartile range","nonmedical applications","surveys","CONCLUSION","speed","quality","METHODS","acceptance","INTRODUCTION","blinded evaluators","resources","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To test the previously proposed replicase-driven template-switching mechanism for recombination, a partially purified TCV replicase preparation (RdRp) was programed with RNAs resembling the putative in vivo recombination intermediates. Analysis of the in vitro RdRp products revealed efficient generation of 3\u0027-terminal extension products. Initiation of 3\u0027-terminal extension occurred at or close to the base of a hairpin that was a recombination hotspot in vivo. Efficient generation of the 3\u0027-terminal extension products depended on two factors: (i) a hairpin structure in the acceptor RNA region and (ii) a short base-paired region formed between the acceptor RNA and the nascent RNA synthesized from the donor RNA template. The hairpin structure bound to the RdRp, and thus is probably involved in its recruitment. The probable role of the base-paired region is to hold the 3\u0027 terminus near the RdRp bound to the hairpin structure to facilitate 3\u0027-terminal extension. These regions were also required for in vivo RNA recombination between TCV-associated sat-RNA C and sat-RNA D, giving crucial and direct support for a replicase-driven template-switching mechanism of RNA recombination.","publish_time":"1998-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagy, P D; Zhang, C; Simon, A E","journal":"The EMBO Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bdfb37e25eb7ec3ab6072564c8a58265142c24f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1170582?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanism of RNA recombination","RNA D","nascent RNA","RNA C","acceptor RNA region","Molecular mechanisms of RNA recombination","donor RNA template","recombination intermediates","recombination hotspot","terminal extension products","RdRp products","hairpin structure","high recombination frequency","purified TCV replicase preparation","proposed replicase-driven template","short base-paired region","recombining TCV-associated satellite RNAs","efficient generation","non-random crossover site distribution","direct support","turnip crinkle carmovirus","factors","probable role","Analysis","Initiation","terminus","regions","recruitment"],"language":"en"},

To solve this problem, we have attempted to construct a universal system in which the recombination activity of various RNA sequences could be tested. To this end, we have used brome mosaic virus, a model (\u002B)RNA virus of plants, for which the structural requirements of RNA recombination are well defined. The effectiveness of the new homomolecular system has been proven in an experiment involving two RNA sequences derived from the hepatitis C virus genome.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study design. Hospital admission and occupancy data for isolation beds was collected from Tan Tock Seng hospital for the period 14(th )March 2003 to 31(st )May 2003. The main outcome measure was daily number of isolation beds occupied by SARS patients. Among the covariates considered were daily number of people screened, daily number of people admitted (including observation, suspect and probable cases) and days from the most recent significant event discovery. We utilized the following strategy for the analysis. Firstly, we split the outbreak data into two. Data from 14(th )March to 21(st )April 2003 was used for model development. We used structural ARIMA models in an attempt to model the number of beds occupied. Estimation is via the maximum likelihood method using the Kalman filter. For the ARIMA model parameters, we considered the simplest parsimonious lowest order model. RESULTS: We found that the ARIMA (1,0,3) model was able to describe and predict the number of beds occupied during the SARS outbreak well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the training set and validation set were 5.7% and 8.6% respectively, which we found was reasonable for use in the hospital setting. Furthermore, the model also provided three-day forecasts of the number of beds required. Total number of admissions and probable cases admitted on the previous day were also found to be independent prognostic factors of bed occupancy. CONCLUSION: ARIMA models provide useful tools for administrators and clinicians in planning for real-time bed capacity during an outbreak of an infectious disease such as SARS. The model could well be used in planning for bed-capacity during outbreaks of other infectious diseases as well.","publish_time":"2005-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Earnest, Arul; Chen, Mark I; Ng, Donald; Sin, Leo Yee","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b13e81ee4495ff3eccaeea21f955ebc5e5cbde1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1274243.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1274243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ARIMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of beds","daily number of isolation beds","daily number of people","ARIMA model parameters","model development","outbreak data","Total number of admissions","recent SARS outbreak","structural ARIMA models","Tan Tock Seng Hospital","Hospital admission","bed-capacity","hospital setting","occupancy data","SARS patients","real-time bed capacity","simplest parsimonious lowest order model","planning","probable cases","independent prognostic factors of bed occupancy","real-time predictions","training set","validation set","main objective","infectious diseases","main outcome measure","retrospective study design","recent significant event discovery","clinicians","administrators","useful tools","MAPE","autoregressive integrated moving average","maximum likelihood method","days","outbreaks","period","attempt","mean absolute percentage error","Kalman filter","CONCLUSION","observation","three-day forecasts","previous day","Estimation","covariates","analysis","following strategy","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We examined whether there is phylogenetic signal in virus nucleotide usage patterns that can be used to determine ancestral relationships. The well-studied model of tail morphology in bacteriophage classification was used for comparison with nucleotide usage patterns. Tetranucleotide usage deviation (TUD) patterns were chosen since they have previously been shown to contain phylogenetic signal similar to that of 16S rRNA. RESULTS: We found that bacteriophages have unique TUD patterns, representing genomic signatures that are relatively conserved among those with similar host range. Analysis of TUD-based phylogeny indicates that host influences are important in bacteriophage evolution, and phylogenies containing both phages and their hosts support their co-evolution. TUD-based phylogeny of eukaryotic viruses indicates that they cluster largely based on nucleic acid type and genome size. Similarities between eukaryotic virus phylogenies based on TUD and gene content substantiate the TUD methodology. CONCLUSION: Differences between phenotypic and TUD analysis may provide clues to virus ancestry not previously inferred. As such, TUD analysis provides a complementary approach to morphology-based systems in analysis of virus evolution.","publish_time":"2006-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pride, David T; Wassenaar, Trudy M; Ghose, Chandrabali; Blaser, Martin J","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f9f32fc7d8af64617d6bbd88c7a42dec0e13a90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1360066.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TUD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Analysis of TUD","TUD analysis","TUD methodology","unique TUD patterns","analysis of virus evolution","TUD-based phylogeny of eukaryotic viruses","virus nucleotide usage patterns","Virus taxonomy","virus ancestry","virus families","eukaryotic virus phylogenies","morphology-based systems","bacteriophage evolution","comparison","co-evolution","phylogenetic signal similar","Tetranucleotide usage deviation","similar host range","bacteriophage classification","host influences","non-phenotypic measures","well-studied model of tail morphology","clues","complementary approach","gene content","nucleic acid type","genome size","hosts","bacteriophages","genomic signatures","Differences","morphologic characteristics","CONCLUSION","Similarities","S rRNA","BACKGROUND","ancestral relationships","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto did not reach such a level, it created a unique opportunity to identify the optimal use of the Internet to promote communication with the public and to preserve health services during an epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore patients\u2019 attitudes regarding the health services that might be provided through the Internet to supplement those traditionally available in the event of a future mass emergency situation. METHODS: We conducted \u201Cmask-to-mask\u201D surveys of patients at three major teaching hospitals in Toronto during the second outbreak of SARS. Patients were surveyed at the hospital entrances and selected clinics. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In total, 1019 of 1130 patients responded to the survey (90% overall response rate). With respect to Internet use, 70% (711/1019) used the Internet by themselves and 57% (578/1019) with the help of a friend or family member. Of the Internet users, 68% (485/711) had already searched the World Wide Web for health information, and 75% (533/711) were interested in communicating with health professionals using the Internet as part of their ongoing care. Internet users expressed interest in using the Web for the following reasons: to learn about their health condition through patient education materials (84%), to obtain information about the status of their clinic appointments (83%), to send feedback to the hospital about how to improve its services (77%), to access screening tools to help determine if they were potentially affected by the infectious agent responsible for the outbreak (77%), to renew prescriptions (75%), to consult with their health professional about nonurgent matters (75%), and to access laboratory test results (75%). Regression results showed that younger age, higher education, and English as a first language were predictors of patients\u2019 interest in using Internet services in the event of an epidemic. CONCLUSION: Most patients are willing and able to use the Internet as a means to maintain communication with the hospital during an outbreak of an infectious disease such as SARS. Hospitals should explore new ways to interact with the public, to provide relevant health information, and to ensure continuity of care when they are forced to restrict their services.","publish_time":"2005-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rizo, Carlos A; Lupea, Doina; Baybourdy, Homayoun; Anderson, Matthew; Closson, Tom; Jadad, Alejandro R","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1550678.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1550678/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Wide","SARS"],"locations":["Toronto"],"keyphrases":["Internet services","health services","Internet users","health condition","health professionals","relevant health information","outbreak of SARS","International health organizations","surveys of patients","Regression results","Toronto","public","event","hospital entrances","communication","mask","optimal use","epidemic","help","access laboratory test results","higher education","predictors of patients\u2019","patients\u2019 attitudes","infectious disease","continuity of care","ongoing care","logistic regression models","major teaching hospitals","patient education materials","World Wide Web","infectious agent responsible","younger age","English","officials","severe acute respiratory syndrome","future mass emergency situation","study","Descriptive statistics","unique opportunity","BACKGROUND","overall response rate","friend","family member","level","language","status","selected clinics","new ways","nonurgent matters","means","clinic appointments","following reasons","OBJECTIVE","aim","analysis","CONCLUSION","total","respect","screening tools","pandemic","METHODS","feedback","prescriptions"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we assessed whether data on RSV collected by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) could be used to build an RSV surveillance system in Europe. METHODS: Influenza and RSV data for the 2002\u20132003 winter season were analysed for England, France, the Netherlands and Scotland. Data from sentinel physician networks and other sources, mainly hospitals, were collected. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza and RSV mainly by virus culture and polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Data on RSV were entered timely into the EISS database. RSV contributed noticeably to influenza-like illness: in England sentinel RSV detections were common in all age groups, but particularly in young children with 20 (40.8%) of the total number of sentinel swabs testing positive for RSV. Scotland and France also reported the highest percentages of RSV detections in the 0\u20134 year age group, respectively 10.3% (N = 29) and 12.2% (N = 426). In the Netherlands, RSV was detected in one person aged over 65 years. CONCLUSION: We recommend that respiratory specimens collected in influenza surveillance are also tested systematically for RSV and emphasize the use of both community derived data and data from hospitals for RSV surveillance. RSV data from the EISS have been entered in a timely manner and we consider that the EISS model can be used to develop an RSV surveillance system equivalent to the influenza surveillance in Europe.","publish_time":"2006-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meerhoff, Tamara J; Fleming, Douglas; Smith, Ann; Mosnier, Anne; van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B; Paget, W John","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/275d7a25357ea46699072167d4ca109108132068.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1560143.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1560143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","European Influenza Surveillance Scheme","EISS"],"locations":["Europe","England","France","Netherlands","Scotland"],"keyphrases":["RSV data","RSV surveillance system equivalent","England sentinel RSV detections","highest percentages of RSV detections","European Influenza Surveillance Scheme","community derived data","Respiratory specimens","EISS database","EISS model","Respiratory syncytial virus","hospitals","France","young children","Scotland","Netherlands","sentinel physician networks","virus culture","severe illness","total number of sentinel swabs","age groups","timely manner","year age group","polymerase chain reaction amplification","important pathogen","sources","infants","BACKGROUND","use","winter season","METHODS","CONCLUSION","person","RESULTS","years","study"],"language":"en"},

IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino acid differences in the S1 protein of vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. Tropism of IBV includes the respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and the kidney. RESULTS: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then genotyped using S1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain reproduced the disease in experimental 1-day-old chickens and resulted in 20% mortality, severe renal and moderate respiratory distresses. Marked histopathological changes in both kidney and trachea were observed in experimentally infected chickens. A protection study using the H120 live attenuated vaccine showed low protection rate in spite of high S1 sequence homology (97%). Protection based criteria were: virus re-isolation attempts from trachea, tracheal and renal histopathology as well as IBV antigens detection by immunofluorescent antibody technique in kidney sections. CONCLUSION: Periodical evaluation of cross-protective capabilities of IBV vaccine(s) versus recently recovered field isolates should be performed to ensure optimum control of IBV.","publish_time":"2006-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S; El-Kady, Magdy F; Ladman, Brian S; Gelb, Jack","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acc751e3f39515573231c168c3c530bfff91fee6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1592083.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592083/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV strains","Tropism of IBV","challenge strains of IBV","optimum control of IBV","IBV antigens detection","protective capabilities of IBV vaccine","S1 protein of vaccine","protection study","poor protection","broiler chickens","day-old chickens","infected chickens","spite of high S1 sequence homology","S1 gene sequence analysis","attenuated vaccine","trachea","respiratory tract tissues","renal histopathology","low protection rate","high homology","Protection based criteria","Infectious bronchitis virus","moderate respiratory distresses","kidney sections","Mass serotype","alimentary tract","field isolates","virus re-isolation attempts","immunofluorescent antibody technique","caecal tonsils","proventriculus","H120","Periodical evaluation of cross","mortality","amino acid differences","Massachusetts","RESULTS","RT-PCR","difficult poultry diseases","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","histopathological changes","oviduct","countries","dozens of serotypes","genotypes","Dot-ELISA","Inoculation","Alignment"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In exploratory interviews patients mentioned having visited a farmers\u0027 market where a sheep had lambed. Serologic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Q fever. We asked local health departments in Germany to identiy notified Q fever patients who had visited the farmers market. To investigate risk factors for infection we conducted a case control study (cases were Q fever patients, controls were randomly selected Soest citizens) and a cohort study among vendors at the market. The sheep exhibited at the market, the herd from which it originated as well as sheep from herds held in the vicinity of Soest were tested for Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii). RESULTS: A total of 299 reported Q fever cases was linked to this outbreak. The mean incubation period was 21 days, with an interquartile range of 16\u201324 days. The case control study identified close proximity to and stopping for at least a few seconds at the sheep\u0027s pen as significant risk factors. Vendors within approximately 6 meters of the sheep\u0027s pen were at increased risk for disease compared to those located farther away. Wind played no significant role. The clinical attack rate of adults and children was estimated as 20% and 3%, respectively, 25% of cases were hospitalized. The ewe that had lambed as well as 25% of its herd tested positive for C. burnetii antibodies. CONCLUSION: Due to its size and point source nature this outbreak permitted assessment of fundamental, but seldom studied epidemiological parameters. As a consequence of this outbreak, it was recommended that pregnant sheep not be displayed in public during the 3(rd )trimester and to test animals in petting zoos regularly for C. burnetii.","publish_time":"2006-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porten, Klaudia; Rissland, J\u00FCrgen; Tigges, Almira; Broll, Susanne; Hopp, Wilfried; Lunemann, Mechthild; van Treeck, Ulrich; Kimmig, Peter; Brockmann, Stefan O; Wagner-Wiening, Christiane; Hellenbrand, Wiebke; Buchholz, Udo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee1b5a9618dcc4080ed100486cedd0969e80fa4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1618839.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618839/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxiella"],"organizations":["Soest County Health Department","Serologic"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["Q fever patients","diagnosis of Q fever","reported Q fever cases","outbreak","Coxiella burnetii","farmers\u0027 market","burnetii antibodies","farmers market","pregnant sheep","case control study","significant risk factors","cohort study","large number of patients","exploratory interviews patients","sheep\u0027s pen","vicinity of Soest","days","increased risk","vendors","Soest County Health Department","selected Soest citizens","significant role","local health departments","Germany","identiy","controls","total","infection","source nature","permitted assessment of fundamental","animals","clinical attack rate of adults","children","close proximity","petting zoos","atypical pneumonia","Serologic testing","size","trimester","mean incubation period","public","METHODS","interquartile range","disease","seconds","herds","epidemiological parameters","RESULTS","Wind","CONCLUSION","consequence","BACKGROUND","ewe"],"language":"en"},

Hence it is of interest to know if the distribution of pathogens over their host range is random, or if there are associations between hosts and pathogens, or between pathogens sharing a host. To analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by pathogens, and for the observed patterns of co-infection, and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations. Applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host-virus associations: most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts, respectively. Interestingly, the more host-selective viruses were the more prevalent ones, suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host pathogens. Analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts. The developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of pathogens, which will help to understand and model the population biology of multi-host pathogens.","publish_time":"2006-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malpica, Jos\u00E9 M.; Sacrist\u00E1n, Soledad; Fraile, Aurora; Garc\u00EDa-Arenal, Fernando","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c64f525d77bf8b2ae4439a875f1bd8eb197a0519.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1762347.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762347/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distribution of multi-host pathogens","host specialisation","host-selective viruses","host co-infection","different pathogens","distribution of pathogens","host-virus associations","population biology of multi-host pathogens","host range conditions","observed patterns of host infection","host-pathogen co-evolution","different groups of pathogens","plant viruses","evolution of hosts","co-infected hosts","observed patterns of co-infection","tests","population dynamics","developed indices","wild plant species","successful strategy","important consequences","tools","prevalent ones","structure","prevalence","issues","randomness","Analyses"],"language":"en"},

Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation. They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection. Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies. We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice. Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs. Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis. These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus. Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS. The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology. This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.","publish_time":"2007-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roberts, Anjeanette; Deming, Damon; Paddock, Christopher D; Cheng, Aaron; Yount, Boyd; Vogel, Leatrice; Herman, Brian D; Sheahan, Tim; Heise, Mark; Genrich, Gillian L; Zaki, Sherif R; Baric, Ralph; Subbarao, Kanta","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3899c3b15d80afef1944752dafbebaa99ee43187.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1769406.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1769406/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["derived MA15 virus","SARS research","lethal virus","recombinant SARS-CoV","dissemination of virus","c mice","severe human cases of SARS","Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus","overwhelming viral infection","respiratory tract of young BALB","aspects of disease","lungs","human disease","intranasal inoculation","severe acute respiratory syndrome","high titer viral replication","bronchial epithelial cells","ciliated epithelial cells","Abundant viral antigen","alveolar pneumocytes","coding mutations","mouse model","statistical evaluation","clinical illness","focal pneumonitis","mediated destruction of pneumocytes","single animal model","necrotic cellular debris","airways","lymphopenia","serial passage","viremia","morbidity","sufficient numbers","alveoli","neutrophilia","extrapulmonary sites","mortality","Urbani strain","immune senescence","efficacy of vaccines","stringent challenge","pathological changes","increased virulence","adaptation","value","rMA15","phenotype","mo-old","pathogenesis studies","pulmonary pathology","antivirals","Lethality","observations","passages","availability"],"language":"en"},

We sought to validate prospectively the clinical utility of one such proteomic profile, the Mass Restricted (MR) score. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 169 consecutive women with singleton pregnancies admitted with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. All women had a clinically indicated amniocentesis to rule out intra-amniotic infection. A proteomic fingerprint (MR score) was generated from fresh samples of amniotic fluid using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry. Presence or absence of the biomarkers of the MR score was interpreted in relationship to the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval, placental inflammation, and early-onset neonatal sepsis for all neonates admitted to the Newborn Special Care Unit (n = 104). Women with \u201Csevere\u201D amniotic fluid inflammation (MR score of 3 or 4) had shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery intervals than women with \u201Cno\u201D (MR score of 0) inflammation or even \u201Cminimal\u201D (MR score of 1 or 2) inflammation (median [range] MR 3\u20134: 0.4 d [0.0\u201349.6 d] versus MR 1\u20132: 3.8 d [0.0\u2013151.2 d] versus MR 0: 17.0 d [0.1\u201394.3 d], p \u003C 0.001). Nonetheless, a \u201Cminimal\u201D degree of inflammation was also associated with preterm birth regardless of membrane status. There was a significant association between the MR score and severity of histological chorioamnionitis (r = 0.599, p \u003C 0.001). Furthermore, neonatal hematological indices and early-onset sepsis significantly correlated with the MR score even after adjusting for gestational age at birth (OR for MR 3\u20134: 3.3 [95% CI, 1.1 to 9.2], p = 0.03). When compared with other laboratory tests routinely used to diagnose amniotic fluid inflammation and infection, the MR score had the highest accuracy to detect inflammation (white blood cell count \u003E 100 cells/mm(3)), whereas the combination of Gram stain and MR score was best for rapid prediction of intra-amniotic infection (positive amniotic fluid culture). CONCLUSIONS: High MR scores are associated with preterm delivery, histological chorioamnionitis, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. In this study, proteomic analysis of amniotic fluid was shown to be the most accurate test for diagnosis of intra-amniotic inflammation, whereas addition of the MR score to the Gram stain provides the best combination of tests to rapidly predict infection.","publish_time":"2007-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buhimschi, Catalin S; Bhandari, Vineet; Hamar, Benjamin D; Bahtiyar, Mert-Ozan; Zhao, Guomao; Sfakianaki, Anna K; Pettker, Christian M; Magloire, Lissa; Funai, Edmund; Norwitz, Errol R; Paidas, Michael; Copel, Joshua A; Weiner, Carl P; Lockwood, Charles J; Buhimschi, Irina A","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b9911544622c1028499e1db9cf9fb783c2ed863.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1769412.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1769412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amniotic fluid inflammation","High MR scores","diagnosis of intra-amniotic inflammation","Proteomic analysis of amniotic fluid","placental inflammation","degree of inflammation","positive amniotic fluid culture","fresh samples of amniotic fluid","rapid prediction of intra-amniotic infection","preterm delivery","preterm birth","presence of biomarkers characteristic of intrauterine inflammation","onset sepsis","onset neonatal sepsis","preterm labor","proteomic profile","proteomic fingerprint","consecutive women","combination of Gram stain","delivery intervals","best combination of tests","shorter amniocentesis","preterm premature rupture of membranes","severity of histological chorioamnionitis","neonatal hematological indices","Mass Restricted","mass spectrometry","laboratory tests","surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization","SELDI","neonates","white blood cell count","singleton pregnancies","highest accuracy","Newborn Special Care Unit","addition","accurate test","cells","gestational age","BACKGROUND","study","significant association","FINDINGS","clinical utility","membrane status","CONCLUSIONS","absence","median","range","relationship","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Computational techniques predicting TF-binding site specificity are frequently unreliable. On the other hand, comprehensive experimental validation is difficult and time consuming. We introduce a simple strategy that dramatically improves robustness and accuracy of computational binding site prediction. First, we evaluate the rate of recurrence of computational TFBS predictions by commonly used sampling procedures. We find that the vast majority of results are biologically meaningless. However clustering results based on nucleotide position improves predictive power. Additionally, we find that positional clustering increases robustness to long or imperfectly selected input sequences. Positional clustering can also be used as a mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling approaches for improvements in accuracy over each one alone. Finally, we predict and validate regulatory sequences partially responsible for transcriptional control of the mammalian type A \u03B3-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R) subunit genes. Positional clustering is useful for improving computational binding site predictions, with potential application to improving our understanding of mammalian gene expression. In particular, predicted regulatory mechanisms in the mammalian GABA(A)R subunit gene family may open new avenues of research towards understanding this pharmacologically important neurotransmitter receptor system.","publish_time":"2007-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reddy, Timothy E.; Shakhnovich, Boris E.; Roberts, Daniel S.; Russek, Shelley J.; DeLisi, Charles","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0a0f45be3069a32ba190502ab88b6df6d520199.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1807961.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1807961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clustering results","computational binding site predictions","interface of computational","Computational techniques","accuracy of computational binding site prediction","understanding of mammalian gene expression","computational TFBS predictions","mammalian GABA","positional clustering increases robustness","control of gene expression","TF-binding site specificity","R subunit gene family","regulatory sequences","used sampling procedures","vast majority of results","transcriptional control","experimental biology","regulatory mechanisms","subunit genes","multiple sampling approaches","comprehensive experimental validation","selected input sequences","\u03B3-aminobutyric acid receptor","important neurotransmitter receptor system","potential application","major challenge","new avenues of research","nucleotide position","improvements","time consuming","hand","rate of recurrence","predictive power","transcription factor","simple strategy"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to characterize the cytokine profile in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) taken from infants during upper respiratory tract infection to investigate whether RSV induced a unique immune response as compared with other viruses. Additionally, we sought to determine whether this profile was influenced by the infants\u0027 atopic status. A prospective birth cohort of babies at high risk of atopy was recruited. Ratios of a T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3) and a T-helper 2 (Th2)-like cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), in NPAs were determined during episodes of respiratory tract infections in the first year. The viral aetiology of the respiratory tract infections was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and immunofluorescence. Atopic status was ascertained at 1 year of age using skin prick tests. Participants were recruited antenatally and subsequently followed in the community. Sixty babies with one or both parents atopic were enrolled into the study. IFN-\u03B3 : IL-10 ratios in NPAs during upper respiratory tract infections and their correlation with viral aetiology and atopic status were the main outcome measures. The mean IFN-\u03B3 : IL-10 ratio was significantly lower (due to lower IFN-\u03B3) during RSV infections than during infections with other viruses (P = 0\u00B7035). The cytokine ratio, however, did not differ between infants with or without wheeze during URTIs (P = 0\u00B744), or between infants who were atopic or non-atopic (P = 0\u00B749). This study suggests that RSV is associated with lower IFN-\u03B3 production in young babies, regardless of their atopic status, compared to upper respiratory tract infections where either another virus is detected or where no viral identification is made.","publish_time":"2003-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"JOSHI, P; SHAW, A; KAKAKIOS, A; ISAACS, D","journal":"Clinical and Experimental Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40870c8e2ef7abb8b88bdeb1651b18a531a3bb86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1808612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1808612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["upper respiratory tract infections","RSV infections","episodes of respiratory tract infections","infants\u0027 atopic status","parents atopic","mean IFN-\u03B3","lower IFN-\u03B3 production","NPAs","Respiratory syncytial virus","cytokine profile","cytokine ratio","viral aetiology","young babies","Ratios","T-helper","viral identification","viruses","study","prospective birth cohort of babies","year of age","correlation","polymerase chain reaction","children","PCR","Th1","interferon gamma","high risk of atopy","common causes of hospitalization","nasopharyngeal aspirates","main outcome measures","culture","skin prick tests","Th2","unique immune response","developed countries","wheeze","URTIs","interleukin","immunofluorescence","cause of asthma","Participants","community"],"language":"en"},

Groups of three C57BL/6 mice were infected with the pathogenic L2-MHV3 or attenuated YAC-MHV3 viruses, and the natural killer (NK) cell populations from liver, spleen and bone marrow were analysed. The percentage of intrahepatic NK1\u00B71(\u002B)T cell receptor (TCR)(\u2212) cells did not increase while NK1\u00B71(\u002B)TCR(inter) cells decreased in both L2-MHV3- and YAC-MHV3-infected mice.

The NK cell decreases were due to the viral permissivity leading to cytopathic effects characterized by cell rounding, syncytia formation and apoptosis.

The mechanisms of lethality are not well-understood. In this study, we analyzed virus replication and host immune responses after intranasal infection with lethal and non-lethal doses of VV using the WR strain and the less virulent Wyeth strain. RESULTS: The WR strain replicated more vigorously in the lung and in the brain than the Wyeth strain. There were, however, no differences between the virus titers in the brains of mice infected with the higher lethal dose and the lower non-lethal dose of WR strain, suggesting that the amount of virus replication in the brain is unlikely to be the sole determining factor of lethality. The WR strain grew better in primary mouse lung cells than the Wyeth strain. Lethal infection with WR strain was associated with a reduced number of lymphocytes and an altered phenotype of the T cells in the lung compared to non-lethal infections with the WR or Wyeth strains. Severe thymus atrophy with a reduction of CD4 and CD8 double positive T cells was also observed in the lethal infection. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the lethality induced by intranasal infection with a high dose of the WR strain is caused by the higher replication of virus in lung cells and immune suppression during the early phase of the infection, resulting in uncontrolled virus replication in the lung.","publish_time":"2007-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayasaka, Daisuke; Ennis, Francis A; Terajima, Masanori","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e39c8a18a3d59b83951c4ebc331c17a54e6dacab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1810241.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1810241/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower non-lethal dose of WR strain","virulent Wyeth strain","intranasal infection","higher replication of virus","higher lethal dose","virus titers","uncontrolled virus replication","Respiratory infection","acute infection","non-lethal infections","non-lethal doses of VV","primary mouse lung cells","neurovirulent vaccinia virus","results","Wyeth strains","mechanisms of lethality","high dose","CD8 double positive T cells","sole determining factor of lethality","immune suppression","brains of mice","host immune responses","reduction of CD4","altered phenotype","Western Reserve","reduced number of lymphocytes","early phase","organs","Severe thymus atrophy","dissemination","BACKGROUND","differences","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) which contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure which itself is not involved in priming, but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5\u2032-segment that initiates stable priming, and a short 3\u2032-segment that determines target-specific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool for blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates, and thereby generates consistently high PCR specificity even under less than optimal PCR conditions. The strength and utility of the DPO system are demonstrated here using multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR.","publish_time":"2007-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chun, Jong-Yoon; Kim, Kyoung-Joong; Hwang, In-Taek; Kim, Yun-Jee; Lee, Dae-Hoon; Lee, In-Kyoung; Kim, Jong-Kee","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/810e609cbc20ab7c1543f7131f18b7fd0a3e2ca8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1874606.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874606/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","DPO","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oligonucleotide primer","proper priming","stable priming","primer segments","primer design","DPO system","used primer system","multiplex PCR","Successful PCR","separate priming regions","optimal PCR conditions","novel dual priming oligonucleotide","DPO-based system","SNP genotyping PCR","high PCR specificity","inevitable risk of mismatched priming","blocking extension","structure results","polydeoxyinosine linker","bubble-like structure","target-specific extension","optimization of reaction conditions","fundamental tool","considerable time","distinct annealing properties","primed templates","effort","strength","utility","template DNA","parts","boundary"],"language":"en"},

We generated neutralizing anti-H5N1 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tested their efficacy for prophylaxis and therapy in a murine model of infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using Epstein-Barr virus we immortalized memory B cells from Vietnamese adults who had recovered from infections with HPAI H5N1 viruses. Supernatants from B cell lines were screened in a virus neutralization assay. B cell lines secreting neutralizing antibodies were cloned and the mAbs purified. The cross-reactivity of these antibodies for different strains of H5N1 was tested in vitro by neutralization assays, and their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo was tested in mice. In vitro, mAbs FLA3.14 and FLD20.19 neutralized both Clade I and Clade II H5N1 viruses, whilst FLA5.10 and FLD21.140 neutralized Clade I viruses only. In vivo, FLA3.14 and FLA5.10 conferred protection from lethality in mice challenged with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) in a dose-dependent manner. mAb prophylaxis provided a statistically significant reduction in pulmonary virus titer, reduced associated inflammation in the lungs, and restricted extrapulmonary dissemination of the virus. Therapeutic doses of FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 provided robust protection from lethality at least up to 72 h postinfection with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). mAbs FLA3.14, FLD21.140 and FLD20.19, but not FLA5.10, were also therapeutically active in vivo against the Clade II virus A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1). CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide proof of concept that fully human mAbs with neutralizing activity can be rapidly generated from the peripheral blood of convalescent patients and that these mAbs are effective for the prevention and treatment of H5N1 infection in a mouse model. A panel of neutralizing, cross-reactive mAbs might be useful for prophylaxis or adjunctive treatment of human cases of H5N1 influenza.","publish_time":"2007-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simmons, Cameron P; Bernasconi, Nadia L; Suguitan, Amorsolo L; Mills, Kimberly; Ward, Jerrold M; Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh; Hien, Tran Tinh; Sallusto, Federica; Ha, Do Quang; Farrar, Jeremy; de Jong, Menno D; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Subbarao, Kanta","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49b957bb681c7cae440ef4241a9fc99f37028d78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1880850.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1880850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["human mAbs","mAbs FLA3","HPAI H5N1 viruses","treatment of H5N1 infection","cross-reactive mAbs","different strains of H5N1","FLA5","neutralizing anti-H5N1 human monoclonal antibodies","neutralizing antibodies","adjunctive treatment of human cases of H5N1 influenza","human infections","neutralized Clade","FLD21","FLD20","virus neutralization assay","Therapeutic doses of FLA3","panel of neutralizing","neutralizing activity","therapeutic efficacy","pulmonary virus titer","Epstein-Barr virus","B cell lines","therapeutic strategies","mAb prophylaxis","lethality","mice","memory B cells","murine model of infection","New prophylactic","conferred protection","mouse model","robust protection","neutralization assays","pathogenic avian influenza","significant reduction","associated inflammation","lungs","Vietnamese adults","therapy","proof of concept","prevention","restricted extrapulmonary dissemination","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","peripheral blood of convalescent patients","studies","cross-reactivity","h postinfection","Supernatants","Indonesia","dose-dependent manner","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS. Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome. As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques. Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.

In the 1990s, the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide. Since then, researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba. Scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity. Using tumor cells as a cell model, corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound. More recently, a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds. The ellagitannin Lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity. In a different approach, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method, Chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin-like glucose transport inducing activity. Coupling HPLC fractionation with a glucose uptake assay, gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity, not corosolic acid. Penta-O-galloyl-glucopyranose (PGG) was identified as the most potent gallotannin. A comparison of published data with results obtained for PGG indicates that PGG has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than Lagerstroemin. Chen et al. have also shown that PGG exhibits anti-adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes. The combination of glucose uptake and anti-adipogenesis activity is not found in the current insulin mimetic drugs and may indicate a great therapeutic potential of PGG.","publish_time":"2007-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klein, Guy; Kim, Jaekyung; Himmeldirk, Klaus; Cao, Yanyan; Chen, Xiaozhuo","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2176148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2176148/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chen"],"organizations":["Lagerstroemia","PGG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["banaba extract","antidiabetic activity of banaba","banaba water extract","methanol extract of banaba","glucose uptake assay","different components of banaba","combination of glucose uptake","higher glucose transport stimulatory activity","anti-adipogenesis activity","different cell model","components responsible","great therapeutic potential of PGG","corosolic acid","different approach","Chen","ellagitannin Lagerstroemin","attention of scientists","3T3-L1 adipocytes","anti-adipogenic properties","water soluble fraction","current insulin mimetic drugs","treatment of diabetes","Lythraceae","focus","addition","functional screening method","Philippinos","results","gallotannins","kidney related diseases","effective component","Southeast Asian tree","glucopyranose","HPLC fractionation","Penta-O-galloyl","comparison of published data","herbal medicine","various forms","leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa","tumor cells","popularity","studies","discovery","active compound","potent gallotannin","researchers","compounds"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (\u223C10(11) viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points. Peak infection of common honey bee viruses and Nosema occurred in the summer, whereas levels of the trypanosomatid Crithidia mellificae and Lake Sinai virus 2, a novel virus, peaked in January.","publish_time":"2011-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Runckel, Charles; Flenniken, Michelle L.; Engel, Juan C.; Ruby, J.

Prior studies using recombinant MHV strains that differ only in the spike gene, which encodes a glycoprotein involved in virus-host cell attachment, demonstrated that spike mediates anterograde axonal transport of virus to the spinal cord. A demyelinating MHV strain induces optic neuritis, but whether this is due to retrograde axonal transport of viral particles to the retina, or if it is due to traumatic disruption of retinal ganglion cell axons during intracranial inoculation is not known. Using recombinant isogenic MHV strains, we examined the ability of recombinant MHV to induce optic neuritis by retrograde spread from the brain through the optic nerve into the eye following intracranial inoculation. Recombinant demyelinating MHV induced macrophage infiltration of optic nerves, demyelination and axonal loss whereas optic neuritis and axonal injury were minimal in mice infected with the non-demyelinating MHV strain that differs in the spike gene. Thus, optic neuritis was dependent on a spike glycoprotein-mediated mechanism of viral antigen transport along retinal ganglion cell axons. These data indicate that MHV spreads by retrograde axonal transport to the eye and that targeting spike protein interactions with axonal transport machinery is a potential therapeutic strategy for CNS viral infections and associated diseases.","publish_time":"2011-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shindler, Kenneth S.; Chatterjee, Dhriti; Biswas, Kaushiki; Goyal, Ashish; Dutt, Mahasweta; Nassrallah, Mayssa; Khan, Reas S.; Sarma, Jayasri Das","journal":"Journal of Neuropathology \u0026 Experimental Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a39a657c4fddc7bfb9943d9df7e7c994ada4c88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3110774.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-pdf/70/6/470/9561356/70-6-470.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","MHV","Recombinant"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optic neuritis","recombinant MHV strains","axonal loss","MHV spreads","axonal transport machinery","ability of recombinant MHV","axonal transport of viral particles","anterograde axonal transport of virus","axonal injury","recombinant isogenic MHV strains","non-demyelinating MHV strain","spike gene","Recombinant demyelinating MHV induced macrophage infiltration of optic nerves","spike glycoprotein-mediated mechanism of viral antigen transport","eye following intracranial inoculation","spike protein interactions","demyelination","CNS viral infections","virus-host cell attachment","retrograde spread","traumatic disruption of retinal ganglion cell axons","neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus","potential therapeutic strategy","acute inflammation","mice","brain","associated diseases","Prior studies","spinal cord","data"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the prevalence of HBoV infection and the association between viral (HBoV) load and clinical features of the infection in patients of all age-groups. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with symptoms of respiratory infection were tested for presence of HBoV by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low- and high-viral-load groups using 1.0\u00D710(6) copies/mL as the threshold value of viral load. RESULTS: Detection rate of HBoV was 4.8% (N=93) in a total of 1,926 samples with peak incidence of infection being observed in patients aged 6-12 months. HBoV infection was more frequently observed in young children, especially, in children aged less than 5 yr, and the HBoV load decreased with increase in age. HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses in 17 (18.3%) of the 93 HBoV-positive patients and 15 patients (88.2%) belonged to the low-viral-load group. Patients infected with HBoV alone showed a higher viral load than those patients in whom HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses (median load, 3.78\u00D710(5) copies/mL vs. 1.94\u00D710(4) copies/mL, P=0.014). Higher pulse rate (P=0.007) and respiratory rate (P=0.021) were observed in patients with a high-viral-load. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HBoV may be the causative agent of respiratory infection in the high-viral-load group.","publish_time":"2011-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jang Su; Lim, Chae Seung; Kim, Young Kee; Lee, Kap No; Lee, Chang Kyu","journal":"Korean J Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d86ddb1f87053b373d42baadaba6a449fb22fa4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3129349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3129349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV load","HBoV-positive patients","presence of HBoV","prevalence of HBoV infection","higher viral load","Detection rate of HBoV","high-viral","load groups","low-viral","median load","threshold value of viral load","viral pathogen","respiratory rate","symptoms of respiratory infection","respiratory viruses","causative agent of respiratory infection","respiratory infections","copies","peak incidence of infection","Higher pulse rate","age-groups","RESULTS","clinical epidemiology","clinical features","young children","association","real-time polymerase chain reaction","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","total","samples","significance","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Human bocavirus","yr","increase","CONCLUSIONS","months"],"language":"en"},

Many factors regulate ADAMTS13-dependent VWF proteolysis through their interaction with VWF.

Conversely, thrombospondin-1 decreases the rate of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 by competing with ADAMTS13 for the A3 domain of VWF. To investigate whether murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human VWF affect the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 in vitro, eight mAbs to different domains of human VWF were used to evaluate the effects on VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 under fluid shear stress and static/denaturing conditions. Additionally, the epitope of anti-VWF mAb (SZ34) was mapped using recombinant proteins in combination with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. The results indicate that mAb SZ34 inhibited proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 in a concentration-dependent manner under fluid shear stress, but not under static/denaturing conditions. The binding epitope of SZ34 mAb is located between A1555 and G1595 in the central A2 domain of VWF.

As resistance traits are difficult or impossible to measure directly, potential indirect criteria are measures of immune traits (ITs). Our underlying hypothesis is that levels of ITs with no focus on specific pathogens define an individual\u0027s immunocompetence and thus predict response to pathogens in general. Since variation in ITs depends on genetic, environmental and probably epigenetic factors, our aim was to estimate the relative importance of genetics. In this report, we present a large genetic survey of innate and adaptive ITs in pig families bred in the same environment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fifty four ITs were studied on 443 Large White pigs vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and analyzed by combining a principal component analysis (PCA) and genetic parameter estimation. ITs include specific and non specific antibodies, seric inflammatory proteins, cell subsets by hemogram and flow cytometry, ex vivo production of cytokines (IFN\u03B1, TNF\u03B1, IL6, IL8, IL12, IFN\u03B3, IL2, IL4, IL10), phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation. While six ITs had heritabilities that were weak or not significantly different from zero, 18 and 30 ITs had moderate (0.1\u003Ch2\u22640.4) or high (h2\u003E0.4) heritability values, respectively. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between ITs were weak except for a few traits that mostly include cell subsets. PCA revealed no cluster of innate or adaptive ITs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that variation in many innate and adaptive ITs is genetically controlled in swine, as already reported for a smaller number of traits by other laboratories. A limited redundancy of the traits was also observed confirming the high degree of complementarity between innate and adaptive ITs. Our data provide a genetic framework for choosing ITs to be included as selection criteria in multitrait selection programmes that aim to improve both production and health traits.","publish_time":"2011-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flori, Laurence; Gao, Yu; Lalo\u00EB, Denis; Lemonnier, Ga\u00EBtan; Leplat, Jean-Jacques; Teillaud, Ang\u00E9lique; Cossalter, Anne-Marie; Laffitte, Jo\u00EBlle; Pinton, Philippe; de Vaureix, Christiane; Bouffaud, Marcel; Mercat, Marie-Jos\u00E9; Lef\u00E8vre, Fran\u00E7ois; Oswald, Isabelle P.; Bidanel, Jean-Pierre; Rogel-Gaillard, Claire","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9572dc31ce0512cc966d43fbe693656af18a03c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3146468.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3146468/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resistance traits","immune traits","health traits","specific pathogens","large genetic survey of innate","genetic correlations","genetic framework","smaller number of traits","selection criteria","cluster of innate","genetic parameter estimation","cell subsets","specific antibodies","PCA","h2","variation","aim","major selection objective","multitrait selection programmes","production of cytokines","improvement of resistance","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Large White pigs","potential indirect criteria","principal component analysis","high degree of complementarity","hemogram","seric inflammatory proteins","flow cytometry","IL10","IFN\u03B3","IL12","IL8","IL6","TNF\u03B1","IFN\u03B1","ex","IL4","IL2","individual\u0027s immunocompetence","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae","Increasing robustness","phagocytosis","response","livestock breeding","results","epigenetic factors","focus","pig families","levels","lymphocyte proliferation","BACKGROUND","SIGNIFICANCE","laboratories","relative importance of genetics","heritability values","underlying hypothesis","CONCLUSIONS","environment","METHODOLOGY","data","limited redundancy","report","moderate","heritabilities","swine"],"language":"en"},

Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a well-established model for dissecting virus-host interactions and is one of very few viruses whose RNA replication, gene expression and encapsidation have been reproduced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previously, our laboratory identified \u223C100 non-essential host genes whose loss inhibited or enhanced BMV replication at least 3-fold. However, our isolation of additional BMV-modulating host genes by classical genetics and other results underscore that genes essential for cell growth also contribute to BMV RNA replication at a frequency that may be greater than that of non-essential genes. To systematically identify novel, essential host genes affecting BMV RNA replication, we tested a collection of \u223C900 yeast strains, each with a single essential gene promoter replaced by a doxycycline-repressible promoter, allowing repression of gene expression by adding doxycycline to the growth medium. Using this strain array of \u223C81% of essential yeast genes, we identified 24 essential host genes whose depleted expression reproducibly inhibited or enhanced BMV RNA replication. Relevant host genes are involved in ribosome biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and protein homeostasis, among other cellular processes. BMV 2a(Pol) levels were significantly increased in strains depleted for a heat shock protein (HSF1) or proteasome components (PRE1 and RPT6), suggesting these genes may affect BMV RNA replication by directly or indirectly modulating 2a(Pol) localization, post-translational modification or interacting partners. Investigating the diverse functions of these newly identified essential host genes should advance our understanding of BMV-host interactions and normal cellular pathways, and suggest new modes of virus control.","publish_time":"2011-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gancarz, Brandi L.; Hao, Linhui; He, Qiuling; Newton, Michael A.; Ahlquist, Paul","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a03298211c385b7bd1d1ebdc98b1cc69efe7f54d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3161824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3161824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genes essential","non-essential host genes","essential yeast genes","non-essential genes","Relevant host genes","enhanced BMV replication","enhanced BMV RNA replication","isolation of additional BMV-modulating host genes","understanding of BMV","replication step","Positive-strand RNA virus replication","dissecting virus-host interactions","single essential gene promoter","cellular proteins","depleted expression","yeast strains","repression of gene expression","cell growth","cellular processes","Brome mosaic virus","Pol","new modes of virus control","normal cellular pathways","doxycycline-repressible promoter","yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae","viral proteins","protein homeostasis","growth medium","cell cycle regulation","heat shock protein","ribosome biosynthesis","loss","HSF1","well-established model","classical genetics","results","proteasome components","post-translational modification","encapsidation","PRE1","localization","RPT6","collection","frequency","viruses","novel","partners","levels","laboratory","fold","diverse functions","strain array"],"language":"en"},

ZEBOV primarily targets mononuclear phagocytes, which are activated upon infection and secrete mediators believed to trigger initial stages of pathogenesis. The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response. This suggests that GP(1,2) binding to macrophages plays an important role in the immediate cellular response.","publish_time":"2011-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wahl-Jensen, Victoria; Kurz, Sabine; Feldmann, Friedericke; Buehler, Lukas K.; Kindrachuk, Jason; DeFilippis, Victor; da Silva Correia, Jean; Fr\u00FCh, Klaus; Kuhn, Jens H.; Burton, Dennis R.; Feldmann, Heinz","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84bf3b3e1716be122763fef2463f88970a8306d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3196478.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3196478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZEBOV infection","blood of ZEBOV","ZEBOV virions","VP40-GP","initial response","immediate cellular response","ZEBOV matrix protein VP40","cellular proteins","aberrant response","virion binding","virus gene expression","particles","VLP","inflammatory mediators","Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages","initial stages of pathogenesis","comparable responses","primary stimulus","cell entry","pro-apoptotic signals","responses of target cells","hour of Ebola virion exposure","important role","infections","mRNA concentrations","insight","quantitative PCR","DNA microarrays","hypothesis","LPS","possible points of therapeutic intervention","high lethality","spike glycoprotein","acute phase of disease","Significant changes","characterization","observation","Zaire ebolavirus","infected humans","mononuclear phagocytes","primates","contrast"],"language":"en"},

It is now clear however that they induce potent immune responses against transgene products which can lead to destruction of transduced cells. Therefore, developing strategies to circumvent these immune responses and facilitate long-term expression of transgenic therapeutic proteins is a main challenge in gene therapy. We evaluated herein a strategy to inhibit the undesirable immune activation that follows muscle gene transfer by administration of CTLA-4/Ig to block the costimulatory signals required early during immune priming and by using gene transfer of PD-1 ligands to inhibit T cell functions at the tissue sites. We provide the proof of principle that this combination immunoregulatory therapy targeting two non-redundant checkpoints of the immune response, i.e., priming and effector functions, can improve persistence of transduced cells in experimental settings where cytotoxic T cells escape initial blockade. Therefore, CTLA-4/Ig plus PD-L1/2 combination therapy represents a candidate approach to circumvent the bottleneck of immune responses directed toward transgene products.","publish_time":"2011-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adriouch, Sahil; Franck, Emilie; Drouot, Laurent; Bonneau, Carole; Jolinon, Nelly; Salvetti, Anna; Boyer, Olivier","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/185a01541eeba3c18e5c68ee961fdabd6069564e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3202221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune priming","bottleneck of immune responses","potent immune responses","gene therapy","undesirable immune activation","combination therapy","gene transfer of PD","cytotoxic T cells","muscle gene transfer","combination immunoregulatory therapy","persistence of transduced cells","destruction of transduced cells","transgene products","T cell functions","PD-L1","administration of CTLA","effector functions","non-redundant checkpoints","experimental settings","long-term expression of transgenic therapeutic proteins","main challenge","ligands","efficient vector candidates","recombinant AAVs","initial blockade","candidate approach","monogenic diseases","tissue sites","costimulatory signals","proof of principle","strategy","strategies"],"language":"en"},

Patient reports of tick bites suggested that infection could contribute to FTLS. Many tick-transmitted microbial pathogens were tested for by PCR/RT-PCR and/or indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). However, only 8% (24/285) of samples collected from 2007 to 2010 tested positive for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), suggesting that other pathogens could be involved. Here, we used an unbiased metagenomic approach to screen and survey for microbes possibly associated with FTLS. BLASTx analysis of deduced protein sequences revealed that a novel bunyavirus (36% identity to Tehran virus, accession: HQ412604) was present only in sera from FTLS patients. A phylogenetic analysis further showed that, although closely related to Uukuniemi virus of the Phlebovirus genus, this virus was distinct. The candidate virus was examined for association with FTLS among samples collected from Henan province during 2007\u20132010. RT-PCR, viral cultures, and a seroepidemiologic survey were undertaken. RT-PCR results showed that 223 of 285 (78.24%) acute-phase serum samples contained viral RNA. Of 95 patients for whom paired acute and convalescent sera were available, 73 had serologic evidence of infection, with 52 seroconversions and 21 exhibiting a 4-fold increase in antibody titer to the virus. The new virus was isolated from patient acute-phase serum samples and named Henan Fever Virus (HNF virus). Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the virus was a novel bunyavirus with genetic similarity to known bunyaviruses, and was most closely related to the Uukuniemi virus (34%, 24%, and 29% of maximum identity, respectively, for segment L, M, S at maximum query coverage). After the release of the GenBank sequences of SFTSV, we found that they were nearly identical (\u003E99% identity). These results show that the novel bunyavirus (HNF virus) is strongly correlated with FTLS.","publish_time":"2011-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Bianli; Liu, Licheng; Huang, Xueyong; Ma, Hong; Zhang, Yuan; Du, Yanhua; Wang, Pengzhi; Tang, Xiaoyan; Wang, Haifeng; Kang, Kai; Zhang, Shiqiang; Zhao, Guohua; Wu, Weili; Yang, Yinhui; Chen, Haomin; Mu, Feng; Chen, Weijun","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54774da1d5cb436f9bac63726a08b399b05c6992.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3219706.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FTLS","PCR/RT-PCR","Henan Fever Virus"],"locations":["Henan","China"],"keyphrases":["HNF virus","Uukuniemi virus","Tehran virus","new virus","candidate virus","Henan Fever Virus","FTLS patients","novel bunyavirus","RT-PCR results","patient acute-phase serum samples","Henan Province","maximum identity","viral cultures","cases of fever","viral RNA","seroepidemiologic survey","convalescent sera","Patient reports of tick bites","microbial pathogens","phylogenetic analysis","BLASTx analysis of deduced protein sequences","GenBank sequences of SFTSV","serologic evidence of infection","maximum query coverage","HGA","screen","human granulocytic anaplasmosis","thrombocytopenia","HQ412604","accession","Phlebovirus genus","leukopenia syndrome","genetic similarity","unbiased metagenomic approach","indirect immunofluorescence assay","antibody titer","microbes","association","fold increase","IFA","release","bunyaviruses","segment","seroconversions","China","genome sequencing"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigate the origin of the first identified outbreak of NiV encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore. We analyse data on livestock production from the index site (a commercial pig farm in Malaysia) prior to and during the outbreak, on Malaysian agricultural production, and from surveys of NiV\u0027s wildlife reservoir (flying foxes). Our analyses suggest that repeated introduction of NiV from wildlife changed infection dynamics in pigs. Initial viral introduction produced an explosive epizootic that drove itself to extinction but primed the population for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction of the virus. The resultant within-farm persistence permitted regional spread and increased the number of human infections. This study refutes an earlier hypothesis that anomalous El Ni\u00F1o Southern Oscillation-related climatic conditions drove emergence and suggests that priming for persistence drove the emergence of a novel zoonotic pathogen.

These compact modules play central roles in mediating every aspect of the regulatory functionality of the cell. They are particularly prominent in mediating cell signaling, controlling protein turnover and directing protein localization. Given their importance, our understanding of motifs is surprisingly limited, largely as a result of the difficulty of discovery, both experimentally and computationally. The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource at http://elm.eu.org provides the biological community with a comprehensive database of known experimentally validated motifs, and an exploratory tool to discover putative linear motifs in user-submitted protein sequences. The current update of the ELM database comprises 1800 annotated motif instances representing 170 distinct functional classes, including approximately 500 novel instances and 24 novel classes.

Furthermore, addition of full-text search capabilities, an enhanced interface and simplified batch download has improved the overall accessibility of the ELM data. The motif discovery portion of the ELM resource has added conservation, and structural attributes have been incorporated to aid users to discriminate biologically relevant motifs from stochastically occurring non-functional instances.","publish_time":"2011-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dinkel, Holger; Michael, Sushama; Weatheritt, Robert J.; Davey, Norman E.; Van Roey, Kim; Altenberg, Brigitte; Toedt, Grischa; Uyar, Bora; Seiler, Markus; Budd, Aidan; J\u00F6dicke, Lisa; Dammert, Marcel A.; Schroeter, Christian; Hammer, Maria; Schmidt, Tobias; Jehl, Peter; McGuigan, Caroline; Dymecka, Magdalena; Chica, Claudia; Luck, Katja; Via, Allegra; Chatr-aryamontri, Andrew; Haslam, Niall; Grebnev, Gleb; Edwards, Richard J.; Steinmetz, Michel O.; Meiselbach, Heike; Diella, Francesca; Gibson, Toby J.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a17719f2c1d211a651060441bda8bc1c052e2aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3245074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ELM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel instances","ELM resource","ELM database","validated motifs","putative linear motifs","relevant motifs","understanding of motifs","annotated motif instances","Eukaryotic Linear Motif","non-functional instances","novel classes","motif discovery portion","protein turnover","protein localization","protein sequences","mediating cell","older motif class entries","comprehensive database","regulatory functionality","difficulty of discovery","distinct functional classes","plastic components of regulatory proteins","enhanced interface","simplified batch download","exploratory tool","overall accessibility","text search capabilities","low-affinity interaction interfaces","central roles","aspect","biological community","conservation","compact modules","addition","structural attributes","result","users","current update","importance","annotation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We utilize the multi-phase Richards model to fit the weekly cumulative pH1N1 epidemiological data (numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations) as well as the daily number of classes suspended under a unique \u0022325\u0022 partial school closing policy in Taiwan, in order to pinpoint the turning points of the summer and fall/winter waves, and to estimate the reproduction numbers R for each wave. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the summer wave had slowed down by early September when schools reopened for fall. However, a second fall/winter wave began in late September, approximately 4 weeks after the school reopened, peaking at about 2-3 weeks after the start of the mass immunization campaign in November. R is estimated to be in the range of 1.04-1.27 for the first wave, and between 1.01-1.05 for the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: Transmissibility of the summer wave in Taiwan during July-early September, as measured by R, was lower than that of the earlier spring outbreak in North America and Europe, as well as that of the winter outbreak in Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, transmissibility during fall/winter in Taiwan was noticeably lower than that of the summer, which is attributable to population-level immunity acquired from the earlier summer wave and also to the intervention measures that were implemented prior to and during the fall/winter wave.","publish_time":"2011-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Cheng, Kuang-Fu; Wu, Trong-Neng; Li, Tsai-Chung; Chen, Chiu-Ying; Chen, Jin-Hua; Lin, Mei-Hui","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97a1819c0624a7acb41785e205bba7ea964c1a78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3247203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3247203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan","North America","Europe","Southern Hemisphere"],"keyphrases":["fall","earlier summer wave","winter outbreak","Taiwan","winter waves","transmissibility","earlier spring outbreak","order","reproduction numbers R","intervention measures","weeks","school reopened","pH1N1 pandemic","epidemiological patterns","Southern Hemisphere","Northern Hemisphere","weekly cumulative pH1N1 epidemiological data","numbers of confirmed cases","successive waves of infections","partial school closing policy","multi-phase Richards model","North America","population-level immunity","start","hospitalizations","course","Europe","relation","turning points","mass immunization campaign","daily number of classes","temporal changes","epidemic","analysis","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","schools","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","range"],"language":"en"},

DCs are located in the mucosal surfaces that are involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and they are probably among the earliest targets of HIV-1 infection. DCs have an important role in viral transmission and dissemination, and HIV-1 has evolved different strategies to evade DC antiviral activity. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a DNA-binding nuclear protein that can act as an alarmin, a danger signal to alert the innate immune system for the initiation of host defense. It is the prototypic damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, and it can be secreted by innate cells, including DCs and natural killer (NK) cells. The fate of DCs is dependent on a cognate interaction with NK cells, which involves HMGB1 expressed at NK\u2013DC synapse. HMGB1 is essential for DC maturation, migration to lymphoid tissues and functional type-1 polarization of na\u00EFve T cells. This review highlights the latest advances in our understanding of the impact of HIV on the interactions between HMGB1 and DCs, focusing on the mechanisms of HMGB1-dependent viral dissemination and persistence in DCs, and discussing the consequences on antiviral innate immunity, immune activation and HIV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2011-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gougeon, M-L; Melki, M-T; Sa\u00EFdi, H","journal":"Cell Death Differ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/130a78592d496162b6584f9ed9b9ea3791a61ee7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3252828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate cells","NK cells","fate of DCs","mechanisms of HMGB1","impact of HIV","HIV pathogenesis","Dendritic cells","immune responses","innate immune system","earliest targets of HIV","polarization of na\u00EFve T cells","immune activation","dependent viral dissemination","lymphoid tissues","viral transmission","antiviral innate immunity","DC maturation","DC antiviral activity","DC synapse","T-cell responses","migration","functional type","natural killer","human immunodeficiency virus","different strategies","important role","consequences","cognate interaction","persistence","danger signal","prototypic damage","molecular pattern molecule","initiation of host defense","understanding","High mobility group box","antigens","interactions","latest advances","mucosal surfaces","alarmin","DNA","infection","nuclear protein","review"],"language":"en"},

Current genome annotation programs do not identify all of the functional elements of the genome, especially small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Whole genome transcriptome analysis is a complementary method to identify \u201Cnovel\u201D genes, small RNAs, regulatory regions, and operon structures, thus improving the structural annotation in bacteria. In particular, the identification of non-coding RNAs has revealed their widespread occurrence and functional importance in gene regulation, stress and virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts in Histophilus somni, one of the causative agents of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) as well as bovine infertility, abortion, septicemia, arthritis, myocarditis, and thrombotic meningoencephalitis. In this study, we report a single nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of H. somni strain 2336 using RNA-Seq method. The RNA-Seq based transcriptome map identified 94 sRNAs in the H. somni genome of which 82 sRNAs were never predicted or reported in earlier studies. We also identified 38 novel potential protein coding open reading frames that were absent in the current genome annotation. The transcriptome map allowed the identification of 278 operon (total 730 genes) structures in the genome. When compared with the genome sequence of a non-virulent strain 129Pt, a disproportionate number of sRNAs (\u223C30%) were located in genomic region unique to strain 2336 (\u223C18% of the total genome). This observation suggests that a number of the newly identified sRNAs in strain 2336 may be involved in strain-specific adaptations.","publish_time":"2012-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Ranjit; Lawrence, Mark L.; Watt, James; Cooksey, Amanda M.; Burgess, Shane C.; Nanduri, Bindu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c46224620e6c2f039588f57d5133dedd75941da5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3262788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3262788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["somni genome","total genome","genome sequence","genome transcriptome analysis","Genome structural annotation","Current genome annotation programs","identification of non-coding RNAs","somni strain","identified sRNAs","small non-coding RNAs","non-coding transcripts","small RNAs","genes","non-virulent strain","functional elements","disproportionate number of sRNAs","regulatory elements","strain-specific adaptations","Histophilus somni","operon structures","single nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of","functional importance","RNA-Seq method","novel potential protein coding open reading frames","regulatory regions","bovine infertility","complementary method","systems level analysis","causative agents of Bovine Respiratory Disease","widespread occurrence","gene regulation","arthritis","BRD","proteins","myocarditis","abortion","septicemia","stress","prerequisite","boundaries","thrombotic meningoencephalitis","virulence","demarcation","genomic region unique","study","bacteria","earlier studies","observation"],"language":"en"},

One mechanism is molecular mimicry, where a foreign antigen shares sequence or structural similarities with self-antigens. Molecular mimicry has typically been characterized on an antibody or T cell level. However, structural relatedness between pathogen and self does not account for T cell activation in a number of autoimmune diseases. A proposed mechanism that could have been misinterpreted for molecular mimicry is the expression of dual T cell receptors (TCR) on a single T cell. These T cells have dual reactivity to both foreign and self-antigens leaving the host vulnerable to foreign insults capable of triggering an autoimmune response. In this review, we briefly discuss what is known about molecular mimicry followed by a discussion of the current understanding of dual TCRs. Finally, we discuss three mechanisms, including molecular mimicry, dual TCRs, and chimeric TCRs, by which dual reactivity of the T cell may play a role in autoimmune diseases.","publish_time":"2011-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cusick, Matthew F.; Libbey, Jane E.; Fujinami, Robert S.","journal":"Clin Rev Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/189c25db19ffe602167dce79662f4f3a55e9f592.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3266166.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular mimicry","T cell activation","single T cell","T cell level","expression of dual T cell receptors","dual reactivity","T cells","number of autoimmune diseases","current understanding of dual TCRs","autoimmune response","self-antigens","chimeric TCRs","foreign insults capable","foreign antigen shares sequence","structural similarities","structural relatedness","variety of mechanisms","proposed mechanism","host vulnerable","discussion","role","pathogen","antibody","means","infections","review"],"language":"en"},

Based on sequence alignment, the C-terminal non-conservative sequence showed low identity with those of other species; thus, the partial sequence AtGUS(-3t) (1\u2013592 aa) was amplified to determine the effects of the non-conservative sequence on the enzymatic properties. AtGUS and AtGUS(-3t) were expressed in E. coli BL21, producing AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E, respectively. At the similar optimum temperature (55\u00B0C) and pH (AtGUS-E, 6.6; AtGUS(-3t)-E, 7.0) conditions, the thermal stability of AtGUS(-3t)-E was enhanced at 65\u00B0C, and the metal ions Co(2\u002B), Ca(2\u002B) and Ni(2\u002B) showed opposite effects on AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E, respectively. Furthermore, Km of AtGUS(-3t)-E (1.95 mM) was just nearly one-seventh that of AtGUS-E (12.9 mM), whereas the catalytic efficiency of AtGUS(-3t)-E was 3.2 fold higher than that of AtGUS-E (7.16 vs. 2.24 mM s(\u22121)), revealing that the truncation of non-conservative sequence can significantly improve the catalytic efficiency of AtGUS.

Some researchers believe that interactions between HIV-1 Gag-Pol molecules trigger the activation of embedded PR (which mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage), and that Gag-Pol assembly domains outside of PR may contribute to PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. To determine if the enhancement of PR dimer interaction facilitates PR activation, we placed single or tandem repeat leucine zippers (LZ) at the PR C-terminus, and looked for a correlation between enhanced Gag processing efficiency and increased Gag-PR-LZ multimerization capacity. We found significant reductions in virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by HIV-1 mutants, with LZ fused to the end of PR as a result of enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency. Since VLP production can be restored to wt levels following PR activity inhibition, this assembly defect is considered PR activity-dependent. We also found a correlation between the LZ enhancement effect on Gag cleavage and enhanced Gag-PR multimerization. The results suggest that PR dimer interactions facilitated by forced Gag-PR multimerization lead to premature Gag cleavage, likely a result of premature PR activation. Our conclusion is that placement of a heterologous dimerization domain downstream of PR enhances PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency, implying that structural conformation, rather than the primary sequence outside of PR, is a major determinant of HIV-1 PR activation.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Yen-Yu; Wang, Shiu-Mei; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Chiang, Chien-Cheng; Wang, Chin-Tien","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e035bd3c87d15ec4bca05cd13551c70d1bc5e78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3291649.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291649/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased Gag-PR","end of PR","enhanced Gag-PR multimerization","Gag-PR multimerization lead","activation of embedded PR","PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency","PR dimer interactions","PR activity inhibition","PR activity-dependent","Gag-Pol cleavage","PR C-terminus","result of premature PR activation","enhancement of PR dimer interaction","premature Gag cleavage","Gag-Pol molecules","Gag-Pol context","result of enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency","enhanced Gag processing efficiency","Gag-Pol assembly domains","LZ multimerization capacity","Natural HIV","LZ enhancement effect","major determinant of HIV","correlation","assembly defect","tandem repeat leucine zippers","wt levels","particles","structural conformation","heterologous dimerization domain","virus","placement","protease","primary sequence","significant reductions","VLPs","results","VLP production","conclusion","researchers","homodimeric","mutants"],"language":"en"},

Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem\u2013loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","publish_time":"2011-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuplin, A.; Evans, D.

The success of an intervention depends on the transmissibility of the disease and the contact pattern between persons within a community. The model predicts that use of face masks and general vaccination will only moderately affect the spread of mildly contagious diseases. In contrast, quarantine and ring vaccination can prevent the spread of a wide spectrum of diseases.

Thus, NK cells are an important first line of defense against influenza virus. Here, in a murine model of influenza, we show that virally-induced IL-15 facilitates the trafficking of NK cells into the lung airways. Blocking IL-15 delays NK cell entry to the site of infection and results in a disregulated control of early viral replication. By the same principle, viral control by NK cells can be therapeutically enhanced via intranasal administration of exogenous IL-15 in the early days post influenza infection. In addition to controlling early viral replication, this IL-15-induced mobilization of NK cells to the lung airways has important downstream consequences on adaptive responses. Primarily, depletion of responding NK1.1\u002B NK cells is associated with reduced immigration of influenza-specific CD8 T cells to the site of infection. Together this work suggests that local deposits of IL-15 in the lung airways regulate the coordinated innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza infection and may represent an important point of immune intervention.","publish_time":"2012-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verbist, Katherine C.; Rose, David L.; Cole, Charles J.; Field, Mary B.; Klonowski, Kimberly D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed6df0da64d5906c75be784b767035e93c6e3809.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3356330.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356330/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trafficking of NK cells","cells function","induced mobilization of NK cells","site of infection","influenza virus","induced IL","specific CD8 T cells","early days post influenza infection","lung airways","viral control","reduced immigration of influenza","murine model of influenza","disregulated control of early viral replication","delays NK cell entry","local deposits of IL","adaptive responses","adaptive immune responses","intranasal administration of exogenous IL","important point of immune intervention","important downstream consequences","interim effectors","natural killer","results","line of defense","principle","work","NK1","addition","respiratory tract","depletion"],"language":"en"},

There are extensive ongoing experimental efforts to understand the biological functions of the gene products encoded in the human genome. However, computational analysis can aid immensely in the interpretation of biological function by associating known functional/structural domains to the human proteins. In this article we have discussed the implications of such associations. The association of structural domains to human proteins could help in prioritizing the targets for structure determination in the structural genomics initiatives. The protein kinase family is one of the most frequently occurring protein domain families in the human proteome while P\u2010loop hydrolase, which comprises many GTPases and ATPases, is a highly represented superfamily. Using the superfamily relationships between families of unknown and known structures we could increase structural information content of the human genome by about 5%. We could also make new associations of domain families to 33 human proteins that are potentially linked to genetically inherited diseases.

Study Design: The authors conducted a single\u2010blind, prospective, cross\u2010sectional study. Methods: Patients with sinus disease and a control group without sinus disease were enrolled in the study. A disease\u2010specific, validated Sinonasal Outcomes Test survey (SNOT\u201020) was completed by the subjects and a generalized validated Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey (SF\u201036) was also completed. An endoscopically guided brush sampling of nasal mucous was obtained from the middle meatus. Fungal specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was performed on the obtained sample to identify one of 82 different species of fungus in the laboratory. Statistical analysis was used to categorize the recovered fungal DNA and to crossreference this information with the outcomes surveys. Results: The fungal recovery rate in the study was 45.9% in patients with sinus disease and 45.9% in control subjects. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis had a mean SNOT\u201020 score of 1.80 versus the control group mean score of 0.77 (P \u003C .0001). SF\u201036 data similarly showed a statistically significant difference between diseased and control populations with controls scoring a mean of 80.37 and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis scoring a mean of 69.35 for a P value of .02.

Results: There were significantly more negative faecal samples among the healthy dogs (82\u00B70 per cent) compared with 55\u00B78 per cent in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P\u003C0\u00B7001).

Rotaviruses were the most commonly found among all the viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents we detected, with the exception of the coronaviruslike particles, which are the subject of another paper [Sitbon, 1985].","publish_time":"2005-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sitbon, Marc; Lecerf, Alain; Garin, Yves; Ivanoff, Bernard","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae1842bf139134fb3c8b3034c76e9c211e10f742.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rotaviruses"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["years of age","Rotaviruses","nonhospitalized diarrheic children","diarrheic adults","electron microscopy","matched controls","subject","Gabon","equatorial Africa","year study of rotavirus prevalence","parasitic agents","coronaviruslike particles","exception","season months","paper","Sitbon"],"language":"en"},

We compared the cytokine profile in Caco2 cells after infection of SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) with other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (FluAV), and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2). Interferon (IFN) system (production and response) was not suppressed by SARS\u2010CoV infection. Therefore, SARS\u2010CoV replication was suppressed by pretreatment with IFN. SARS\u2010CoV and RSV induced high levels of IL\u20106 and RANTES compared with FluAV and hPIV2. Induction level of suppressor of cytokine signaling\u20103 (SOCS3) by SARS\u2010CoV was significantly lower than that by RSV in spite of the significant production of IL\u20106. Toll\u2010like receptors 4 and 9, which correlate with the induction of inflammatory response, were upregulated by SARS\u2010CoV infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten normal subjects were imaged with either 0.1 mmol/kg (N = 5) or 0.2 mmol/kg (N = 5) of Gd\u2010DTPA\u2010BMA contrast agent at 1.5T and 3T. T(1) measurements of blood and myocardium were performed prior to contrast injection and every five minutes for 35 minutes following contrast injection at both field strengths. Measurements of biodistribution were calculated from the ratio of \u0394R(1) (\u0394R (1myo)/\u0394R (1blood)). RESULTS: Precontrast blood T(1) values (mean \u00B1 SD, N = 10) did not significantly differ between 1.5T and 3T (1.58 \u00B1 .13 sec, and 1.66 \u00B1 .06 sec, respectively; P \u003E 0.05), but myocardium T(1) values were significantly different (1.07 \u00B1 .03 sec and 1.22 \u00B1 .07 sec, respectively; P \u003C 0.05). The field\u2010dependent difference in myocardium T(1) postinjection (T(1)@3T \u2013 T(1)@1.5T) decreased by approximately 72% relative to precontrast T(1) values, while the field\u2010dependent difference of blood T(1) decreased only 30% postcontrast. Measurements of \u0394R (1myo)/\u0394R (1blood) were constant for 35 minutes postcontrast, but changed between 1.5T and 3T (0.46 \u00B1 .06 vs. 0.54 \u00B1 .06, P \u003C 0.10).

The pathogenesis of MS is believed to be due to an immunologic response in a genetically predisposed individual, localized within the central nervous system white matter, and triggered by exposure to an environmental agent such as a virus. Based on our personal experience we find that the efficacy of IFN therapy is hampered in MS patients by the presence of an interferon inhibitor factor (IIF) in the patients\u0027 sera which we have isolated and characterized. When plasmapheresis (PP) was done on 24 MS patients with intermittent 3\u2010day administration of IFN\u2010a and human leukocyte IFN, marked increase of IFN in 18 patients and modest increase in three patients correlated with clinical improvement. Three clinical nonresponders showed no increase in IFN levels following therapy. The ability to remove IIF and lymphokine inhibitor factor (LIF) by PP may explain the successful treatment of our patients. We describe the evaluation of helper T cells, suppressor T cells, HLADR antigen, natural killer cells, and monocyte/macrophage cell populations by flow cytometry before and after PP. A significant increase in these immune\u2010competent cells correlated with marked improvement in Kurtzke disability status scale in 13 patients, while eight stabilized. Patients showing progression of the disease either showed decrease or no change in these parameters after therapy. Encouraging results from this pilot study suggest that PP combined with immunomodulatory regimens of IFN may be an effective therapy for MS.","publish_time":"2006-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Medenica, Rajko D.; Mukerjee, Sonjoy; Alonso, Kenneth; Lazovic, Gavrilo; Huschart, Teresa","journal":"J Clin Apher","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcad8eb3f2d19039bf0795cfd75ee1bb0f8f71d7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166857/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","IIF","PP."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increase of IFN","MS patients","IFN levels","efficacy of IFN therapy","day administration of IFN","human leukocyte IFN","immunomodulatory regimens of IFN","competent cells","significant increase","modest increase","pathogenesis of MS","effective therapy","suppressor T cells","natural killer cells","evaluation of helper T cells","IIF","interferon inhibitor factor","marked improvement","clinical improvement","lymphokine inhibitor factor","use of interferon","successful treatment","clinical nonresponders","treatment of multiple sclerosis","HLADR antigen","monocyte","Kurtzke disability status scale","macrophage cell populations","central nervous system white matter","flow cytometry","LIF","presence","predisposed individual","exposure","decrease","change","disease","recognized antiviral","pilot study","environmental agent","immunomodulating actions","immunologic response","parameters","progression","patients\u0027 sera","virus","personal experience","results","rationale","plasmapheresis"],"language":"en"},

Department of Safety and Health, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd.\u2014 OBJECTIVES: This study was a cross\u2010sectional survey of Japanese workers regarding the relationship between touching the eyes or nose and susceptibility to URTI in workers. METHODS: The survey respondents were 4,663 Japanese workers. Subjects were surveyed via a self\u2010administered questionnaire regarding their susceptibility to URTI and how often they touched their eyes or nose. In addition, subjects were surveyed regarding their preventive behaviors and routine behaviors thought to be associated with URTIs. A multiple logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between susceptibility to URTI and how often the eyes or nose are touched. RESULTS: Responses from 3,663 individuals who answered the self\u2010administered questionnaire were analyzed. There were 1,590 individuals (42.9%) with a \u201Cfrequent incidence of URTIs\u201D, defined as URTIs more than once a year. In terms of how often the eyes or nose are touched, the odds ratios (95% CI) for a frequent incidence of URTIs among the groups responding \u201Csometimes\u201D and \u201Coften\u201D were 1.41 (1.21\u22121.63) and 1.96 (1.59\u22122.42) (trend test: p\u003C0.001) compared with the groups responding \u201Cnever\u201D and \u201Calmost never\u201D. Multivariate\u2010adjusted odds ratios adjusted for confounding factors, i.e., behaviors to prevent URTIs, routine behaviors associated with URTIs, age, sex and BMI, were 1.33 (1.14\u22121.54) and 1.69 (1.36\u22122.09) (trend test: p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present cross\u2010sectional study indicates that susceptibility to URTI and how often the eyes or nose are touched are significantly associated in Japanese workers, independent of preventive behaviors and routine behaviors associated with URTIs.","publish_time":"2013-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukunaka, Yasushi; Sawada, Susumu S.; Nishiura, Chihiro; Noguchi, June; Tsukamoto, Koji; Otsuji, Yutaka; Marui, Eiji","journal":"J Occup Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39b36a99ac1d4159f399a990428af09102670d50.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Yasushi"],"organizations":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","al.

Feline osteoclastic resorptive lesions (FORL) involve extensive resorption of the tooth leaving it liable to root fracture and subsequent tooth loss. The aetio\u2010pathogenesis of FORL is not known. Recent work has shown that systemic acidosis causes increased osteoclast activation and that loci of infection or inflammation in cat mouth are likely to be acidotic. To investigate this, we generated osteoclasts from cat blood and found that they formed in large numbers (\u223C400) in cultures on bovine cortical bone slices. Acidosis caused an increase in the size of cells\u2014in cultures maintained up to 14 days at basal pH 7.25, mean osteoclast area was 0.01 \u00B1 0.003 mm(2), whereas an 8.6\u2010fold increase was observed in cells cultured between 11 and 14 days at pH 7.15 (0.086 \u00B1 0.004 mm(2)). Acidosis caused a modest increase in the number of osteoclasts. Exposure to pH 6.92 exhibited a 5\u2010fold increase in the area of bone slices covered by resorption lacunae (\u223C70% bone slice resorbed). In line with this finding, significant increases were observed in the expression of cathepsin K and proton pump enzymes (both approximately 3\u2010fold) that are key enzymes reflective of resorptive activity in osteoclasts. These results demonstrate that acidosis is a major regulator of osteoclast formation and functional activation in the cat, and suggest that local pH changes may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of FORL.

Several milestones have been achieved in Dutch clinical gene therapy trials, including the first treatment worldwide of patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency with genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in collaboration with French and British scientists. Until now, about 230 patients with various diseases have been treated with viral and non\u2010viral gene therapy in this country. Ongoing and upcoming Dutch clinical trials focus on the translation of new developments in gene therapy research, including the restoration of genetic defects other than SCID, and the use of oncolytic adenoviruses and targeted T cells for the treatment of cancer. The growing commercial interest in Dutch clinical gene therapy is reflected by the involvement of two Dutch companies in ongoing trials as well as the participation of Dutch clinical centres in large phase III international multicenter immuno\u2010gene therapy trials on prostate cancer sponsored by an American company. Translational gene therapy research in The Netherlands is boosted at a governmental level by the Dutch Ministry of Health via a dedicated funding programme.

In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS\u2010CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS\u2010CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS\u2010CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS. SARS\u2010CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle. These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS\u2010CoV may also be targets of SARS\u2010CoV infection. The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS\u2010CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS\u2010CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways. This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS. Copyright \u00A9 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Yet, although the efficiency of those criteria has been demonstrated also in empirical networks, preventive immunization is rarely applied to real-world scenarios, where the usual approach is the a posteriori attempt to contain epidemic outbreaks using quarantine measures. Here we compare the efficiency of prevention with that of quarantine in terms of the tradeoff between the number of removed and saved nodes on both synthetic and empirical topologies. We show how, consistent with common sense, but contrary to common practice, in many cases preventing is better than curing: depending on network structure, rescuing an infected network by quarantine could become inefficient soon after the first infection.","publish_time":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strona, Giovanni; Castellano, Claudio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de93a525dbb8f6ee5bf076bfb635cc3f883d3385.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217530.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217530/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected network","network structure","issue of optimal network immunization","quarantine measures","common sense","preventive immunization","efficient criteria","common practice","saved nodes","key nodes","occurrence of extensive epidemic outbreaks","empirical topologies","empirical networks","efficiency of prevention","posteriori attempt","usual approach","real-world scenarios","cases","number","terms","curing","tradeoff","order","recent studies","infection"],"language":"en"},

Ultrasound measures of diaphragm thickness or diaphragm dome excursion have been used to aid in predicting extubation success or failure. The aim of this study was to determine if incorporating results of diaphragm ultrasound into usual ICU care would shorten the time to extubation. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study at three Brown University teaching hospitals. Included subjects underwent block randomization to either usual care (Control) or usual care enhanced with ultrasound measurements of the diaphragm (Intervention). The primary outcome was the time to extubation after ultrasound, and the secondary outcome was the total days on the ventilator. Only intensivists in the Intervention group would have the ultrasound information on the likelihood of successful extubation available to incorporate with traditional clinical and physiologic measures to determine the timing of extubation. RESULTS: A total of 32 subjects were studied; 15 were randomized into the Control group and 17 into the Intervention group. The time from ultrasound to extubation was significantly reduced in the Intervention group compared to the Control group in patients with a \u2206tdi% \u2265 30% (4.8 \u00B1 8.4 vs 35.0 \u00B1 41.0 h, p = 0.04). The time from ultrasound to extubation was shorter in subjects with a normally functioning diaphragm (\u2206tdi% \u2265 30%) compared to those with diaphragm dysfunction (\u2206tdi% \u003C 30%) (23.2 \u00B1 35.2 vs 57.3 \u00B1 52.0 h p = 0.046). When combining the Intervention and Control groups, a value of \u2206tdi% \u2265 30% for extubation success at 24 h provided a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 90.9%, 86.7%, 90.9%, and 86.7%, respectively.

In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.

The present study reports the results of epidemiological investigation of possible outbreak of candidemia by C. krusei in paediatric unit at our tertiary care centre. METHODS: Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with C. krusei candidemia were evaluated. Yeast identification and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to standard protocol. To find the potential source of C. krusei in hospital environment and hand colonization, swabs were collected from different fomites (n = 40) and hand washings from 24 health care workers (HCW), respectively. Infection control and prevention practices were intensified following the recognition of outbreak. Genetic typing was done by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) technique. Case\u2013control comparison was performed with C. tropicalis and C. pelliculosa cases. RESULTS: Candida krusei fungaemia significantly affected paediatric group (82/186, 44%) as compared to adults (14/130, 10.8%; p \u003C 0.001). Among paediatric group, maximum isolation was reported from neonatal unit of paediatric emergency (NUPE). C. krusei was isolated from hands of one HCW and washbasin in NUPE. FAFLP revealed clonality between blood and environmental isolates indicating cross-transmission of C. krusei. Gastrointestinal disease (p = 0.018), previous antibiotics (p = 0.021) especially to carbapenems (p = 0.039), was significant among C. krusei candidemia cases compared to C. pelliculosa cases. CONCLUSION: We report the largest outbreak of C. krusei candidemia in paediatric unit within 1 year with isolation of related strains from environment and hands of HCW. Routine screening of hand hygiene practices revealed non-compliance to standard practices leading to the increase in C. krusei candidemia cases.","publish_time":"2020-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaur, Harsimran; Shankarnarayana, Shamanth A.; Hallur, Vinaykumar; Muralidharan, Jayashree; Biswal, Manisha; Ghosh, Anup K.; Ray, Pallab; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash M.","journal":"Mycopathologia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51dfacdd0d405d95802596add581edb4348ace93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["paediatric unit","sudden rise of Candida krusei candidemia cases","Candida krusei fungaemia","paediatric group","maximum cases","pelliculosa cases","neonatal unit of paediatric emergency","standard practices","hands of HCW","results of epidemiological investigation of possible outbreak of candidemia","hospital environment","hand colonization","hand washings","year","maximum isolation","prevention practices","FAFLP","largest outbreak of","recognition of outbreak","NUPE","Routine screening of hand hygiene practices","standard protocol","control comparison","Infection control","isolation of related strains","health care workers","tertiary care centre","fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism","swabs","risk factors","non-compliance","environmental isolates","antifungal susceptibility testing","blood","increase","cross-transmission","Yeast identification","METHODS","Clinical characteristics","clonality","technique","tropicalis","different fomites","Genetic typing","present study","potential source of","BACKGROUND","washbasin","previous antibiotics","CONCLUSION","Gastrointestinal disease","carbapenems","adults"],"language":"en"},

After showing some evidence of human and non-human primate PV recombination, we report a comprehensive recombination analysis of all currently known 82 Alphapapillomaviruses (Alpha-PVs). We carried out an exploratory study and found novel recombination events between High-Risk HPV Types and Macaca fascicularis PV1 (MfPV1), Macaca Fuscata PV2 (MfuPV2) and Pan Paniscus PV1 (PpPV1) Papillomaviruses. This is the first evidence of interactions between PVs from different hosts and hence postulates the likelihood of ancient host switching among Alpha-PVs. Notwithstanding these results should be interpreted with caution because the major and minor parents indicated by RDP4 program are simply the sequences in the alignment that most closely resemble the actual parents. We found statistically significant differences between the phylogenies of the PV sequences with recombination regions and PV sequences without recombination regions using the Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa phylogenetic incongruence testing. We show that not more than 76MYA Alpha-PVs were in the same biological niche, a pre-requisite for recombination, and as the hosts evolved and diversified, the viruses adapted to specific host niches which eventually led to coevolution with specific hosts before speciation of primate species. Thus providing evidence that in ancient times no earlier than the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic age, Alpha-PVs recombined and switched hosts, but whether this host switching is occurring currently is unknown. However, a clearer picture of the PVs evolutionary landscape can only be achieved with the incremental discovery of PV sequences, especially from the animal kingdom.

In this study, we inserted the frameshift region of HIV-1 (a slippery heptanucleotide motif followed by a stem-loop) in a reporter gene coding for firefly luciferase. The ability of the corresponding mRNA, generated by in vitro transcription, to be translated in an Escherichia coli cell-free extract is the first demonstration that the HIV-1 frameshift can be reproduced in a bacterial cell-free extract, providing a powerful approach for analysis of the frameshift mechanism. The responses of the frameshift signal to chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of peptide bond formation, and spectinomycin, an inhibitor of translocation, suggest that the frameshift complies with the same rules found in eukaryotic translation systems. Furthermore, when translation was performed in the presence of streptomycin and neamine, two errorinducing antibiotics, or with hyperaccurate ribosomes mutated in S12, the frameshift efficiency was increased or decreased, respectively, but only in the presence of the stem-loop, suggesting that the stem-loop can influence the frameshift through a functional interaction with the ribosomes.","publish_time":"1999-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brunelle, Marie-No\u00EBlle; Payant, Catherine; Brakier-Gingras, L\u00E9a; Lemay, Guy","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41e5c4742cbe73246e7488fc1e52bf5552541e19.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc148779?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshift signal","frameshift mechanism","frameshift efficiency","frameshift event","frameshift region of HIV","stem-loop","hyperaccurate ribosomes","bacterial cell-free extract","Escherichia coli cell-free extract","corresponding mRNA","pol gene","inhibitor of translocation","presence of streptomycin","reporter gene coding","eukaryotic translation systems","inhibitor of peptide bond formation","mRNA of human immunodeficiency virus type","chloramphenicol","powerful approach","spectinomycin","errorinducing antibiotics","expression","neamine","firefly luciferase","analysis","slippery heptanucleotide motif","rules","S12","demonstration","responses","functional interaction","ability","transcription","study"],"language":"en"},

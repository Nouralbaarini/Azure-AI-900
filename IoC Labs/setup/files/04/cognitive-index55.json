Design Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. Setting Academic research department and clinical diagnostic laboratory. Patients/Animals None. Focused on previously generated gene and protein expression data. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Identification of cell types co-expressing the key ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes and proteins, as well as other candidates potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Results Based on single cell RNA sequencing data, co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not detected in testicular cells, including sperm. A subpopulation of oocytes in non-human primate ovarian tissue were found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but co-expression was not observed in ovarian somatic cells. RNA expression of TMPRSS2 in 18 samples of human cumulus cells was shown to be low or absent. There was general agreement between publicly available bulk RNA and protein datasets in terms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression patterns in testis, ovary, endometrial and placental cells. Conclusion These analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is unlikely to have long-term effects on male and female reproductive function. While the results cannot be considered definitive they imply that procedures in which oocytes are collected and fertilized in vitro are associated with very little risk of viral transmission from gametes to embryos and may indeed have the potential to minimize exposure of susceptible reproductive cell types to infection when compared to natural conception.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stanley, Kate E.; Thomas, Elizabeth; Leaver, Megan; Wells, Dagan","journal":"Fertil Steril","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae49ff0f3a762e1a9ab2a606d210025b4a973d1b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0015028220304350; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028220304350?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA expression of TMPRSS2","co-expression of ACE2","TMPRSS2 expression patterns","cell entry","protein expression data","TMPRSS2 genes","Identification of cell types co-","infection","expression of host genes","SARS-CoV","exposure of susceptible reproductive cell types","single cell RNA sequencing data","terms of ACE2","key ACE2","express ACE2","risk of SARS","placental cells","testicular cells","ovarian somatic cells","female reproductive systems","female reproductive function","proteomic data","proteins","samples of human cumulus cells","Results","available bulk RNA","protein datasets","subpopulation of oocytes","non-human primate ovarian tissue","little risk of viral transmission","ovary","testis","long-term effects","Academic research department","clinical diagnostic laboratory","gametes","Design Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic","Main Outcome Measure","embryos","potential","general agreement","generated gene","virus","analyses","Abstract Objective","candidates","natural conception","procedures","Conclusion","sperm","Patients","Animals","Intervention"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, the nasopharyngeal microbiota could play a role as a risk or protective factor in the development of invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. Methodology: We analyzed the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and that of healthy controls matched by age, sex, and seasonality from Catalonia, Spain. Epidemiological, microbiological and clinical variables were considered to compare microbiota profiles, analyzed by sequencing the V1\u2013V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: Twenty-eight children with IPD (median age 43 months) and 28 controls (42.6 months) were included in the study. IPD children presented a significantly higher bacterial diversity and richness (p \u003C 0.001). Principal coordinate analysis revealed three different microbiota profiles: microbiota A, dominated by the genus Dolosigranulum (44.3%); Microbiota B, mostly represented by Streptococcus (36.9%) and Staphylococcus (21.3%) and a high diversity of anaerobic genera including Veillonella, Prevotella and Porphyromonas; and Microbiota C, mainly containing Haemophilus (52.1%) and Moraxella (31.4%). The only explanatory factor for the three microbiotas was the classification of children into disease or healthy controls (p = 0.006). A significant negative correlation was found between Dolosigranulum vs. Streptococcus (p = 0.029), suggesting a potential antagonistic effect against pneumococcal pathogens. Conclusions: The higher bacterial diversity and richness in children with IPD could suggest an impaired immune response. This lack of immune competence could be aggravated by breastfeeding \u003C6 months and by the presence of keystone pathogens such as Porphyromonas, a bacterium which has been shown to be able to manipulate the immune response, and that could favor the overgrowth of many proteolytic anaerobic organisms giving rise to a dramatic dysbiosis. From an applied viewpoint, we found suggestive microbiota profiles associated to IPD or asymptomatic colonization that could be used as disease biomarkers or to pave the way for characterizing health-associated inhabitants of the respiratory tract. The identification of beneficial bacteria could be useful to prevent pneumococcal infections by integrating those microorganisms in a probiotic formula. The present study suggests not only respiratory tract samples, but also breast milk, as a potential source of those beneficial bacteria.","publish_time":"2019-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Camelo-Castillo, Anny; Henares, Desir\u00E9e; Brotons, Pedro; Galiana, Antonio; Rodr\u00EDguez, Juan Carlos; Mira, Alex; Mu\u00F1oz-Almagro, Carmen","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/233b6a7c5234ef4a8bb7918dab6d5ea8fe0b1aad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6360994.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745895/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae","Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["nasopharyngeal microbiota of children","IPD children","Microbiota C","Microbiota B","different microbiota profiles","suggestive microbiota profiles","specific microbiota profiles","classification of children","invasive pneumococcal disease","months","pneumococcal pathogens","healthy controls","disease biomarkers","higher bacterial diversity","development of invasive disease","Porphyromonas","richness","pneumococcal infections","Streptococcus","impaired immune response","high diversity of anaerobic genera","respiratory tract samples","identification of beneficial bacteria","lack of immune competence","protective factor","median age","potential source","risk of suffering","explanatory factor","genus Dolosigranulum","present study","proteolytic anaerobic organisms","presence of keystone pathogens","potential antagonistic effect","characterizing health-associated inhabitants","way","Veillonella","Prevotella","rise","sex","role","V4 region","Principal coordinate analysis","infectious diseases","clinical variables","seasonality","microorganisms","milk","microbiotas","asymptomatic colonization","S rRNA gene","dramatic dysbiosis","applied viewpoint","significant negative correlation","Catalonia","overgrowth","V1","Haemophilus","breastfeeding","Conclusions","probiotic formula","Spain","bacterium","pneumoniae","Methodology","Results","Moraxella","Staphylococcus","Background"],"language":"en"},

These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations.

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To derive future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth rates. We evaluate our model for public data from Berlin, Germany, by first estimating the model parameters (i.e., time lag and average stay in ICU) for March 2020 and then using an exponential model to predict the future ICU load for April and May 2020. Assuming an ICU rate of 5%, a time lag of 5 days and an average stay of 14 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data and is in accord with independent estimates. Our model is then used to predict future ICU load assuming a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%). For example, based on our parameters the model predicts that the number of ICU patients at the end of May would be 246 if the exponential growth were to continue at a rate of 3%, 1,056 if the growth rate were 5% and 3,758 if the growth rate were 7%. The model can be adjusted as estimates of parameters develop and can thus also help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our predictions are based on a small data set, disregard non-stationary dynamics, and have a number of assumptions, especially an exponential development of cases, our model is simple, robust, adaptable and can be up-dated when further data become available.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ritter, Matthias; Haynes, John-Dylan; Ritter, Kerstin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43d3142577238110b20d1c498294b3c3ef76fd89.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03384v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU rate","exponential model","future ICU load","model parameters","number of ICU patients","exponential growth","simple statistical model","future intensive care","different future growth rates","potential exceedance of ICU capacity","varying growth rates","public data","time lags","estimates of parameters","exponential development of cases","continued exponential phase","days","small data set","number of assumptions","average stay","intensive care unit","predictions","limited number of critical care beds","dynamic development of infections","reported infections","independent estimates","non-stationary dynamics","pandemic","need","ongoing Covid","proportion","accounts","Berlin","Germany","best fit","major bottleneck","accord","example"],"language":"en"},

Axial images of routine and ULD chest CT were evaluated objectively by two expert radiologists and quantitatively by Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and pixel by pixel noise measurement. Results: It was observed that the ULD and routine dose chest CT images could detect Covid 19 related lung lesions in patients with PCR positive test. Also, SNR and pixel noise values were comparable in these protocols. Conclusion: ULD chest CT with 98% dose reduction can be used in non-pandemic situation as a substitute for chest radiograph for screening and follow up.

Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S).

Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume display.

The key priority is to contain the epidemic and prevent the infection rate. In this context, many countries are now in some degree of lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. Further, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 disease. However, manual contact tracing is time consuming and labor-intensive task which tremendously overload public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contact-tracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for government officials on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis.

In this paper, we detail GRANDMA\u0027s observational performance during Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo Observing Run 3 (O3), focusing on the second part of O3; this includes summary statistics pertaining to coverage and possible astrophysical origin of the candidates. To do so, we quantify our observation efficiency in terms of delay between gravitational-wave candidate trigger time, observations, and the total coverage. Using an optimised and robust coordination system, GRANDMA followed-up about 90 % of the gravitational-wave candidate alerts, i.e. 49 out of 56 candidates. This led to coverage of over 9000 deg2 during O3. The delay between the gravitational-wave candidate trigger and the first observation was below 1.5 hour for 50 % of the alerts. We did not detect any electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational-wave candidates during O3, likely due to the very large localisation areas (on average thousands of degrees squares) and relatively large distance of the candidates (above 200 Mpc for 60 % of BNS candidates). We derive constraints on potential kilonova properties for two potential binary neutron star coalescences (GW190425 and S200213t), assuming that the events\u0027 locations were imaged.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antier, S.; Agayeva, S.; Almualla, M.; Awiphan, S.; Baransky, A.; Barynova, K.; Beradze, S.; Blasek, M.; Boer, M.; Burkhonov, O.; Christensen, N.; Coleiro, A.; Corre, D.; Coughlin, M.

We implement an SEIR model, consisting of a set of first-order temporal differential equations (ODE\u0027s) to analyze the time evolution of the disease caused by the virus. The model is applied to the city of Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities (RMBA) with approximately 15 million inhabitants. The parameters of the model are calibrated by using as data the number of casualties officially reported. Since there are infinite solutions honouring the data, we show a set of cases by considering different situations. The first set of parameters yields initially a reproduction ratio R0 = 3.30 decreasing to 0.92 in April 8, after the lockdown, but increasing to 2.44 after April 27, most probably due to an increase of the contagion in highly populated slums. This case has incubation and infection periods of 11 and 7 days, approximately, and about 13 million people infected at the end of the epidemic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 1.88 % and the predicted number of casualties is approximately 249000 deaths at the end of the epidemic. However, this death toll is highly affected by the evolution of the reproduction ratio, and keeping R0 = 0.92 after April 27, would cause 1321 casualties and only 66000 infected individuals.Other cases, assuming the present trend, predict smaller incubation periods (between 4 and 5 days) and yield between 30000 and 90000 deaths and IFRs between 0.5 % and 1 %. This means that the intensity of the lockdown (and behaviour of the population) is essential and that the measures have to be guided by precise model predictions. We also consider doubling the number of casualties to date and, in this case, the death toll is almost 44000 individuals and about 5.1 million people being infected.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santos, Juan E.; Carcione, Jose\u0027 M.; Savioli, Gabriela B.; Gauzellino, Patricia M.; Ravecca, Alejandro; Moras, Alfredo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72fd1ce56f656ff2173c496c97f1b684efa25d69.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06297v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Argentina","Buenos Aires"],"keyphrases":["predicted number of casualties","set of cases","set of parameters","infected individuals","SEIR model","infection periods","reproduction ratio R0","virus","deaths","data","death toll","precise model predictions","epidemic patterns","days","lockdown","people","smaller incubation periods","time evolution","infection fatality rate","ODE\u0027s","RMBA","neighbouring cities","city of Buenos Aires","Argentina","present trend","order temporal differential equations","behaviour","COVID","mathematical modelling perspective","contagion","population","disease","different situations","decreasing","date","populated slums","increase","measures","intensity","infinite solutions","yield","inhabitants","IFRs"],"language":"en"},

The Chinese public transportation system between over 340 prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities, peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be used to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective government interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes.

We study the issue of existence of a generalized Hawkes process, and we provide a construction of a specific generalized multivariate Hawkes process. We investigate Markovian aspects of GMHPs, and we indicate some plausible important applications of GMHPs.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bielecki, Tomasz R.; Jakubowski, Jacek; Nieweglowski, Mariusz","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96fa41bd6ef10e87445fe78a8135d6d44fc7582f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13834v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hawkes"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["generalized Hawkes processes","generalized multivariate Hawkes processes","applications of Hawkes processes","specific generalized multivariate Hawkes process","multivariate process","new class of Hawkes processes","multivariate marked point processes","plausible important applications of GMHPs","Markovian aspects of GMHPs","different sources","different coordinates","important feature","explicit modelling of simultaneous occurrence of excitation events","special subclass","construction","family","theory","issue of existence","work"],"language":"en"},

Due to its easy transmission, developing techniques to accurately and easily identify the presence of COVID19 and distinguish it from other forms of flu and pneumonia is crucial. Recent research has shown that the chest Xrays of patients suffering from COVID19 depicts certain abnormalities in the radiography. However, those approaches are closed source and not made available to the research community for re-producibility and gaining deeper insight. The goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets and present an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID19 cases from other pneumonia cases. Our work utilizes state of the art training techniques including progressive resizing, cyclical learning rate finding and discriminative learning rates to training fast and accurate residual neural networks. Using these techniques, we showed the state of the art results on the open-access COVID-19 dataset. This work presents a 3-step technique to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture to improve model performance and reduce training time. We call it COVIDResNet. This is achieved through progressively re-sizing of input images to 128x128x3, 224x224x3, and 229x229x3 pixels and fine-tuning the network at each stage. This approach along with the automatic learning rate selection enabled us to achieve the state of the art accuracy of 96.23% (on all the classes) on the COVIDx dataset with only 41 epochs. This work presented a computationally efficient and highly accurate model for multi-class classification of three different infection types from along with Normal individuals. This model can help in the early screening of COVID19 cases and help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farooq, Muhammad; Hafeez, Abdul","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/049ea432acc08b04a3e21c390f62be3d845a2e2c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14395v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Convolutional Neural Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["differentiating COVID19 cases","accurate model","presence of COVID19","art training techniques","state","early screening of COVID19 cases","pneumonia cases","open source","novel COVID19 pandemic","cyclical learning rate","open access datasets","open-access COVID","art results","model performance","help","art accuracy","training time","accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework","accurate residual neural networks","automatic learning rate selection","discriminative learning rates","re-producibility","research community","closed source","Recent research","COVIDx dataset","re-sizing of input images","128x128x3","multi-class classification","progressive resizing","different infection types","224x224x3","pre-trained ResNet","architecture","burden","chest Xrays of patients","step technique","229x229x3 pixels","certain abnormalities","Normal individuals","deeper insight","forms of flu","healthcare systems","months","radiography","classes","epochs","approaches","easy transmission","world","stage","goal","COVIDResNet"],"language":"en"},

The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images. Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19 cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case. Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases, respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to classify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework. Clinical studies are the next milestone of this research work.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemdan, Ezz El-Din; Shouman, Marwa A.; Karar, Mohamed Esmail","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d37234b062b448966288c1b369b6af8f0e073979.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11055v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Visual Geometry Group Network","Google","Dense Convolutional Network"],"locations":["Middle East","Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["positive COVID","lack of public COVID","Chest X-ray images","deep neural network model","similar performance of automated COVID","proposed COVIDX-Net framework","different architectures of deep convolutional neural network models","Dense Convolutional Network","new deep learning framework","useful application of deep learning models","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","VGG19","study","Coronavirus disease","novel disease pneumonia","modified Visual Geometry Group Network","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","model training","Coronavirus outbreak","World Health Organization","DenseNet","patient status","perilous viruses","updated reports","city of Wuhan","Coronaviruses","classification","normalized intensities","number of infected people","milestone","deaths","datasets","evaluation","f1-scores","testing phases","China","day","Background","Purpose","Experiments","article","radiologists","version of Google MobileNet","Methods","Clinical studies","research work","end","Results","Conclusions","cases","Materials","aim"],"language":"en"},

We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only at the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire time-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate $\\alpha$ and by increasing the removal rate $\\beta$ by a factor of $\\lambda$. We show that for a given value of the size ($I_P$, the total, $I_E$ and average $\\hat I_P$ number of infected), its occurrence time $t_P$ and entire time-span $t_E$ can be reduced by a factor $1/\\lambda$ if the reduction of $I$ is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time $t_P$ and the entire time span $t_E$ could have been reduced by a factor $0.9 \\le 1/\\lambda\\le 0.34$ with containment measures focused on increasing $\\beta$ instead of reducing $\\alpha$.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cadoni, Mariano","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86f989f2bde0f90c445d81a38f0edbd2d6f15ea3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02189v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak time","occurrence time","entire time-span","entire time span","time domain","time reparametrization","epidemic peak","epidemic dynamics","epidemic containment measures","infection rate","removal rate","factor","SIR dynamics","size","COVID","timescale","reduction","beta","alpha","lambda","number of infected","SIR model","prompt isolation of infected individuals","early detection","tracing","scaling behaviour","epidemics","equations","speed","Northern Italy","amplitude","main challenges","social distancing","given value","problem","results","total","average","price"],"language":"en"},

Up to now, it has been impossible to screen a full viral genome for LRIs experimentally or in silico. Most known LRIs are cross-reacting structures (pseudoknots) undetectable by most bioinformatical tools. Results: We present LRIscan, a tool for the LRI prediction in full viral genomes based on a multiple genome alignment. We confirmed 14 out of 16 experimentally known and evolutionary conserved LRIs in genome alignments of HCV, Tombusviruses, Flaviviruses and HIV-1. We provide several promising new interactions, which include compensatory mutations and are highly conserved in all considered viral sequences. Furthermore, we provide reactivity plots highlighting the hot spots of predicted LRIs.

During recent decades in which the challenges for biodiversity conservation and public health have escalated, zoos have made significant changes to address these difficulties. Zoos increasingly have four key areas of focus: education, recreation, conservation, and research. These key areas are important in addressing an interrelated global conservation (i.e. habitat and wildlife loss) and public health crisis. Zoo and public health professionals working together within a One Health framework represent a powerful alliance to address current and future conservation and public health problems around the world. For researchers, practitioners, and students, the collaboration between zoos and public health institutions offers the opportunity to both teach and operationalize this transdisciplinary approach. Using examples from our programs, we give a template for moving forward with collaborative initiatives and sustainable solutions involving partners in both zoos and public health institutions.

Although the rate of new infections in China has decreased, currently, 169 countries report confirmed cases, with many nations showing increasing numbers daily. Testing for COVID-19 infection is performed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, but availability is limited in many parts of the world. The role of chest computed tomography is yet to be determined and may vary depending on the local prevalence of disease and availability of laboratory testing. A common but nonspecific pattern of disease with a somewhat predictable progression is seen in patients with COVID-19. Specifically, patchy ground-glass opacities in the periphery of the lower lungs may be present initially, eventually undergoing coalescence, consolidation, and organization, and ultimately showing features of fibrosis. In this article, we review the computed tomography features of COVID-19 infection.

The selected mAb showed specificity to Taiwan IBV strains but had no cross-reactivity with the vaccine strain H120. Using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test as a standard, the cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity of a b-ELISA using this mAb were evaluated in 390 field samples. The type-specificity of detection was validated using a panel of chicken hyperimmune sera. The results showed that the b-ELISA demonstrated high sensitivity (98.0%) and specificity (97.2%) of detection. The agreement between the results of the b-ELISA and the HI test was statistically significant (Kappa=0.95), and there was no significant difference between these two methods (McNemar p =0.72). The b-ELISA specifically detected Taiwan IBV serotypes but not three non-Taiwan IBV serotypes nor sera against other avian pathogens. This b-ELISA provides type-specific antibody detection of local IBV strains.

Antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) based on ex vivo expanded peripheral CTLs, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), gene-engineered TCR- and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have all shown durable clinical efficacies in multiple types of cancers. However, these immunotherapeutic approaches only benefit a small fraction of cancer patients as various immune resistance mechanisms and limitations make their effective use a challenge in the majority of cancer patients. For example, adaptive resistance to therapeutic PD-1 blockade is associated with an upregulation of some additional immune checkpoint receptors. The efficacy of transferred tumor-specific T cells under the current clinical ACT protocol is often limited by their inefficient engraftment, poor persistence, and weak capability to attack tumor cells. Recent studies demonstrate that the complement receptor C3aR and C5aR function as a new class of immune checkpoint receptors. Complement signaling through C3aR and C5aR expressed on effector T lymphocytes prevent the production of the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Removing C3aR/C5aR-mediated transcriptional suppression of IL-10 expression results in endogenous IL-10 production by antitumor effector T cells, which drives T cell expansion and enhances T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Importantly, preclinical, and clinical data suggest that a signaling axis consisting of complement/C3aR/C5aR/IL-10 critically regulates T cell mediated antitumor immunity and manipulation of the pathway ex vivo and in vivo is an effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy.

Evidence for change within the ORF1ab coding sequence during the SARS epidemic, as well as evidence from studies with other coronaviruses, indicates that it is likely that the ORF1ab proteins play roles in virus pathogenesis distinct from or in addition to functions directly involved in viral replication. Recent reverse genetic studies have confirmed that proteins of ORF1ab may be involved in cellular signaling and modification of cellular gene expression, as well as virulence by mechanisms yet to be determined.

According to the 2017 report of the European Commission in Mobility and Transport, the performance of all modes for passenger transport (roadways and airways) are reaching record highs. Although the benefits of the increased demand for mobility are substantial and welcome, an effort should be paid such as to ameliorate possible threatening side-effects that may also arise. As World Health Organization (WHO) denotes and as has been evident from the global COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, infectious diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another under common exposure circumstances such as air transportation (especially long-haul airline connections) that may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases. In this paper, analytical and realistic models have been integrated, for providing evidence on the spread dynamics of infectious diseases that may face Europe through the airlines system. In particular, a detailed epidemiological model has been integrated with the airlines\u2019 and land transport network, able to simulate the epidemic spread of infectious diseases originated from distant locations. Additionally, a wide set of experiments and simulations have been conducted, providing results from detailed stress-tests covering both mild as well as aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios. The results provide convincing evidence on the effectiveness that the European airports\u0027 system offer in controlling the emergence of epidemics, but also on the time and extent that controlling measures should be taken in order to break the chain of infections in realistic cases.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikolaou, Paraskevas; Dimitriou, Loukas","journal":"Journal of Air Transport Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca252c3e6de4fc1a1be047cf6fc880ef8a3bd5c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720300454; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969699720300454","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Commission","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["epidemic spread of infectious diseases","spread dynamics of infectious diseases","mobility increases","passenger transport","epidemic outbreak","results","realistic cases","aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios","land transport network","European airports\u0027 system","air transportation","transportation connectivity","increased demand","global COVID","global population","European Commission","long-haul services","convincing evidence","realistic models","airlines system","detailed stress-tests","long-haul airline connections","detailed epidemiological model","effectiveness","prices","common exposure circumstances","airways","roadways","airlines\u2019","modes","performance","simulations","chain of infections","quality","distant locations","time","measures","wide set of experiments","order","person","paper","benefits","report","record highs","emergence of epidemics","possible threatening side-effects","World Health Organization","extent","effort","Abstract","medium"],"language":"en"},

Mutations in the viral spike (S) gene have been associated with FCoVs found in tissues from cats with FIP, but not FCoVs found in faeces from healthy cats, and are implicated in monocyte/macrophage tropism and systemic spread. This study was designed to determine whether S gene mutation analysis can reliably diagnose FIP. Cats were categorised as with FIP (n = 57) or without FIP (n = 45) based on gross post-mortem and histopathological examination including immunohistochemistry for FCoV antigen. RNA was purified from available tissue, fluid and faeces. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on all samples using FCoV-specific primers, followed by sequencing of a section of the S gene on RT-qPCR positive samples. Samples were available from a total of 102 cats. Tissue, fluid, and faecal samples from cats with FIP were more likely to be FCoV RT-qPCR-positive (90.4, 78.4 and 64.6% respectively) than those from cats without FIP (7.8, 2.1 and 20% respectively). Identification of S gene mutated FCoVs as an additional step to the detection of FCoV alone, only moderately increased specificity for tissue samples (from 92.6 to 94.6%) but specificity was unchanged for fluid samples (97.9%) for FIP diagnosis; however, sensitivity was markedly decreased for tissue (from 89.8 to 80.9%) and fluid samples (from 78.4 to 60%) for FIP diagnosis. These findings demonstrate that S gene mutation analysis in FCoVs does not substantially improve the ability to diagnose FIP as compared to detection of FCoV alone.

For safety, although disease transmission is a tangible risk, this possibility has been dramatically minimized through modern tissue-processing methods. These include steps to prevent processing tissues with unacceptable bioburden through rigorous screening using donor medical and social histories along with microbial testing of recovered tissue and viral testing of donor serum. Potential bioburden is also controlled through aseptic recovery and processing methods and then reduced through disinfection steps that can include antibiotics, detergents, mechanical process, chemical solutions, and terminal sterilization. Processing steps may also include decellularization methods to lower immunogenic potential of some tissues. To enhance fusion potential of bone void fillers, demineralization steps may be used, and the resultant demineralized bone matrices may be combined with a carrier to improve handling. Bone void fillers and osteochondral allografts may also be specially processed to retain a living cellular component. To preserve relevant biological, biochemical, and physical properties of allografts for clinical use and ease of handling, a number of methods may be used which include: (1) refrigeration in media, (2) freeze-drying, (3) cryopreservation, (4) freezing, and (5) media storage at room temperature. As academic and industry research continue to drive advances, the future direction of allograft tissue likely includes injectables, coatings, cellular therapies, and combinations with other materials. The technology approaches outlined here will be further described along with future directions.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, Mark A.; Samsell, Brian; McLean, Julie","journal":"Biologics in Orthopaedic Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f76d1232bed4d35c275586cae342338b4cb5d9d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151900.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323551403000059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323551403000059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Processing steps","processing tissues","modern tissue-processing methods","Potential bioburden","decellularization methods","demineralization steps","number of methods","disinfection steps","fusion potential of bone void fillers","clinical use","future direction of allograft tissue","Abstract Allograft tissues","immunogenic potential","safety","microbial testing of recovered tissue","donor medical","viral testing of donor serum","unacceptable bioburden","osteochondral allografts","resultant demineralized bone matrices","cellular therapies","ease of handling","media storage","future directions","physical properties of allografts","living cellular component","rigorous screening","social histories","chemical solutions","detergents","coatings","injectables","mechanical process","antibiotics","advances","aseptic recovery","tangible risk","disease transmission","combinations","terminal sterilization","variety of technologies","industry research","possibility","room temperature","orthopedic surgeons","materials","freeze-drying","carrier","technology approaches","cryopreservation","refrigeration"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults is largely underestimated, and relevant data mostly concern infants and children. Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults hospitalized in Italy. Study design During April 2004\u2013May 2005, 510 consecutive lower respiratory tract samples were prospectively collected. These were evaluated with a molecular panel that detected 12 respiratory viruses. Results Two hundred and fifteen samples were positive for at least one viral pathogen, with an overall sample prevalence of 42.2%. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most commonly detected viruses (32.9%), followed by influenza virus (FLU)-A (9.0%); the other viruses were 2% or less. Multiple agents were detected in 30 samples from 29 patients, resulting in a co-infection rate of 6.7%. Conclusions This study shows a high prevalence of viruses in the lower respiratory tract samples of hospitalized adults, mostly HRV and FLU-A. It is not possible to establish the role of viruses detected at low frequency, but our findings suggest the necessity to consider them as potential causes or precursors of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minosse, C.; Selleri, M.; Zaniratti, M.

A total of 691 cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection had been confirmed as of February 23. The government initially assumed that the infection was not spreading aboard and therefore indicated that any persons who either tested negative for the virus or were asymptomatic should immediately disembark. However, on February 5, the government set a 14-day health observation period because of the severity of the infection. Passengers confirmed to be free from infection began disembarking on Day 15 (February 19) of the quarantine. The effectiveness and validity of infection control, justification for the timing of inspections, and even the nature of COVID-19 itself now are all in question. The ethical considerations related to cruise ship infection control include the reasonable justification for isolation, the psychological fragility and quality of life of the isolated passengers and crew members, the procedural justice inherent in a forced quarantine, and the optimization of control measures. The international coordination framework and the global ramifications of such outbreaks should be reevaluated by the international community. Denying a ship\u2019s entry based on local politics is incompatible with global justice.

In order to ensure a thorough and informed revision of this guidance following the H1N1 2009 pandemic, a systematic review of published and unpublished economic evaluations of preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics was conducted. METHODS: The search was performed in September 2011 using 10 electronic databases, 2 internet search engines, reference list screening, cited reference searching, and direct communication with relevant authors. Full and partial economic evaluations considering both costs and outcomes were included. Conversely, reviews, editorials, and studies on economic impact or complications were excluded. Studies were selected by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: 44 studies were included. Although most complied with the cost effectiveness guidelines, the quality of evidence was limited. However, the data sources used were of higher quality in economic evaluations conducted after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Vaccination and drug regimens were varied. Pharmaceutical plus non-pharmaceutical interventions are relatively cost effective in comparison to vaccines and/or antivirals alone. Pharmaceutical interventions vary from cost saving to high cost effectiveness ratios. According to ceiling thresholds (Gross National Income per capita), the reduction of non-essential contacts and the use of pharmaceutical prophylaxis plus the closure of schools are amongst the cost effective strategies for all countries. However, quarantine for household contacts is not cost effective even for low and middle income countries. CONCLUSION: The available evidence is generally inconclusive regarding the cost effectiveness of preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics. Studies on their effectiveness and cost effectiveness should be readily implemented in forthcoming events that also involve the developing world. Guidelines for assessing the impact of disease and interventions should be drawn up to facilitate these studies.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez Velasco, Rom\u00E1n; Praditsitthikorn, Naiyana; Wichmann, Kamonthip; Mohara, Adun; Kotirum, Surachai; Tantivess, Sripen; Vallenas, Constanza; Harmanci, Hande; Teerawattananon, Yot","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a07f0ba055d2d843908ad7683bc36c3f46e1550.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3290611.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22393352/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cost effectiveness guidelines","studies","cost effectiveness of preparedness strategies","cost effective strategies","high cost effectiveness ratios","non-pharmaceutical interventions","pandemic preparedness","economic impact","unpublished economic evaluations of preparedness strategies","partial economic evaluations","H1N1 pandemic","use of pharmaceutical prophylaxis","quality of evidence","influenza pandemics","public health guidelines","middle income countries","higher quality","reduction of non-essential contacts","response guidance","household contacts","available evidence","impact of disease","cited reference searching","reference list screening","internet search engines","Gross National Income","direct communication","implications","resource allocation","systematic review","closure of schools","issues","ceiling thresholds","electronic databases","informed revision","costs","comparison","editorials","relevant authors","data sources","forthcoming events","vaccines","BACKGROUND","outcomes","complications","developing world","Vaccination","drug regimens","antivirals","order","CONCLUSION","quarantine","independent reviewers","reviews","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Hemoglobin hydrolysis has been described as an ordered process initiated by aspartic proteases, but cysteine protease inhibitors completely block the process, suggesting that cysteine proteases can also initiate hemoglobin hydrolysis. To characterize the specific roles of falcipains, we used three approaches. First, using random P(1) \u2013 P(4) amino acid substrate libraries, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 demonstrated strong preference for cleavage sites with Leu at the P(2) position. Second, with overlapping peptides spanning \u03B1 and \u03B2 globin and proteolysis-dependent (18)O labeling, hydrolysis was seen at many cleavage sites. Third, with intact hemoglobin, numerous cleavage products were identified. Our results suggest that hemoglobin hydrolysis by malaria parasites is not a highly ordered process, but rather proceeds with rapid cleavage by falcipains at multiple sites. However, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 show strong specificity for P(2) Leu in small peptide substrates, in agreement with the specificity in optimized small molecule inhibitors that was identified previously. These results are consistent with a principal role of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 in the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by P. falciparum and with the possibility of developing small molecule inhibitors with optimized specificity as antimalarial agents.","publish_time":"2009-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramanian, Shoba; Hardt, Markus; Choe, Youngchool; Niles, Richard K.; Johansen, Eric B.; Legac, Jennifer; Gut, Jiri; Kerr, Iain D.; Craik, Charles S.; Rosenthal, Philip J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aed44d8b5c29a7cdf02ed56dc2cbac07dd1d6eed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2663817.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19357776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hemoglobin hydrolysis","hydrolysis of hemoglobin","cleavage sites","host hemoglobin","intact hemoglobin","Plasmodium falciparum cysteine proteases falcipain","principal role of falcipain","optimized specificity","optimized small molecule inhibitors","strong specificity","rapid cleavage","ordered process","random P","cysteine protease inhibitors","aspartic proteases","Leu","numerous cleavage products","multiple sites","results","small peptide substrates","free amino acids","demonstrated strong preference","specific roles of falcipains","amino acid substrate libraries","\u03B2 globin","agreement","parasite protein synthesis","malaria parasites","proteolysis-dependent","antimalarial agents","overlapping peptides","possibility","approaches","position"],"language":"en"},

Overall, our studies indicate a comparable analytical performance of the three assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uhteg, Katharine; Jarrett, Junko; Richards, Mahmia; Howard, Craig; Morehead, Elizabeth; Geahr, Melissa; Gluck, Linda; Hanlon, Ann; Ellis, Brandon; Kaur, Harsimar; Simner, Patricia; Carroll, Karen C.; Mostafa, Heba H.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6173eb1b4099a7177e7ded44f19bf7d87159e5a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194987.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361285/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104384; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Johns Hopkins Molecular Virology","CDC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS CoV","diagnostic assays","different molecular assays","detection of SARS","molecular diagnostic methods","diagnostic laboratories","existing molecular platforms","RT-PCR tests","Johns Hopkins Molecular Virology laboratory","comparable analytical performance","new tests","unprecedented energy","testing","RealStar","resources","months","China","FDA-EUA guidance","CDC COVID","validation","cases","ePlex","global community","Wuhan city","rapid spread","studies","novel coronavirus","devastating pandemic","study"],"language":"en"},

Objective To investigate the viral load of WUPyV in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), stool, and serum samples of pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract diseases. Study design We established a real-time PCR for WUPyV DNA and tested NPA obtained between 2002 and 2007 from pediatric in-patients with acute respiratory tract diseases. In addition, 14 stool and 14 serum samples of children with WUPyV DNA positive NPA were analysed. Results WUPyV DNA was found in 5.2% of 1232 NPA. The median viral load in the NPA was 950copies/ml (maximum 3.4E10copies/ml). The WUPyV load in NPA was neither associated with the coinfection status nor with the clinical diagnoses. WUPyV DNA was found in 3 of 14 serum samples and in 2 of 14 stool samples. The WUPyV load in NPA tended to be higher in viremic children. Conclusion WUPyV DNA was found in NPA, serum, and stool of hospitalised children with acute respiratory tract diseases.

We have witnessed within some of our classrooms a more empowered hostility and intolerance to conversations pertaining to social justice. We agree that this phenomenon is pedagogical because this language usage not only teaches, but also legitimizes hate speech. We have witnessed the illogical extension of this hate speech with an increase in hate crimes across the country since the 2016 election, Without peaceful protest and grassroots feminist activism, we fear that this speech, this pedagogy, will spread even more violent forms of hate. This research was conducted in and around the first Women\u0027s March of 2017. We wanted to know: What were marchers\u0027 prior histories of political activism prior to the election? If this was their first time participating in such a manner, how did the election and its early political fallout inspire marchers to attend? 2) What plans did marchers have for political activism after the march? 3) What can be learned from these participants about the current state of political activism in our current era? A total of 788 individuals had taken part in the online survey. Among the participants, 45% marched on Washington, and 55% participated in the march in their local cities. We found that issues of gender equality were of great concern to many of the marchers. In particular, issues related to economic and social equity, including salary. These findings are interesting as they speak to the broader implications of gender equality. And, as the past few years have demonstrated, these issues continue to be of concern.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Jennifer L.; Smith, Julia","journal":"Womens Stud Int Forum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd7bbc405a334e1098309700d0b5e92b662328af.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394998/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277539520300170?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277539520300170; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2020.102375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hate speech","election","current state of political activism","hate crimes","issues of gender equality","marchers\u0027 prior histories of political activism","grassroots feminist activism","early political fallout","social equity","violent forms of hate","participants","social justice advocacy teaching","current era","broader implications of gender equality","great concern","intolerance","conversations","peaceful protest","increase","empowered hostility","shift","country","phenomenon","language usage","classrooms","salary","illogical extension","individuals","years","manner","pedagogy","online survey","Abstract","professors","local cities","total","findings","past","time","Washington","research","Women\u0027s"],"language":"en"},

It is emphasised that care must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, using maternal and fetal monitoring when appropriate. It is also suggested that there must be monitoring of oxygen saturation and maternal haemodynamics in order to minimise fetal hypoxaemia.

In China, a country stereotyped as a major source of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, research on the public understanding of animal influenza is limited to the Han, the main ethnic group. The present qualitative study in Southwest China investigated awareness of animal influenza among the Dai, an ethnic minority. The participants (15 men and 10 women, ages 18\u201383) were smallholder farmers of pigs and poultry in rural areas of Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province. A mixture of interviews and group discussions took place in homes and villages. The participants were asked about their knowledge of avian influenza (H7N9), swine influenza (H1N1), precautions taken to protect against influenza, procedures when animals were sick and perceived risk of animal influenza. The data were analysed following coding and thematic analysis. The findings demonstrated a limited understanding of animal health and welfare among participants. Specifically, they were largely unaware of animal influenza (H7N9, H1N1) including its causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment.

To further characterize the earliest apoptotic signaling events, here we treated cells with an antibody specific to the MHV receptor prior to and during virus infection or with an antibody specific to MHV spike protein following virus binding. Both treatments blocked virus infection and apoptosis, indicating that virus\u2013receptor binding is necessary but not sufficient for the apoptosis induction. Furthermore, virus infection significantly increased the formation of the \u201Cdeath\u2013receptor complexes\u201D consisting of Fas, Fas-associated death domain and procaspase-8, but did not induce the complexes involving the tumor necrosis factor receptor and its associated death domain, demonstrating the specific activation of the Fas signaling pathway. Moreover, virus infection did not alter the abundance of the individual proteins of the complexes, suggesting that the activation of the Fas signaling pathway was at the post-translational level. Treatment with a Fas/Fc chimera, which blocks Fas-Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis, inhibited the formation of the complexes and blocked the activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis in MHV-infected cells. It also inhibited the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-9. These results demonstrate that oligodendrocyte apoptosis is triggered by MHV infection during cell entry through the activation of the Fas signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2007-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yin; Zhang, Xuming","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c696ad98a8f1f5e073df3405efbda15a18674319.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1851929.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206008002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206008002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV infection","Fas-Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis","MHV receptor","virus binding","specific activation","receptor complexes","oligodendrocyte apoptosis","apoptosis induction","treatments blocked virus infection","Fas-associated death domain","activation of caspase","receptor binding","pathway","infection of rat oligodendrocytes","MHV-infected cells","antibody specific","MHV spike protein","ultraviolet light-inactivated mouse hepatitis virus","formation","cell entry","tumor necrosis factor receptor","mitochondria","Fc chimera","abundance","procaspase","release of cytochrome c","post-translational level","events","individual proteins","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We conducted a pilot prospective open, single-arm multicentre study on off-label use of tocilizumab (TCZ) involving 63 hospitalised adult patients (56 males, age 62.6\u00B112.5) with severe COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14. No moderate-to severe adverse events attributable to TCZ were recorded. RESULTS We observed a significant improvement in the levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer. The ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa02) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02) improved (mean\u00B1SD Pa02/Fi02 at admission: 152\u00B153; at day 7: 283.73 \u00B1 115.9, at day 14: 302.2 \u00B1 126, p\u003C0.05).

All of this, complying with privacy policies and making the measurement acceptable. To this end, we introduce the Visual Social Distancing (VSD) problem, defined as the automatic estimation of the inter-personal distance from an image, and the characterization of the related people aggregations. VSD is pivotal for a non-invasive analysis to whether people comply with the SD restriction, and to provide statistics about the level of safety of specific areas whenever this constraint is violated. We then discuss how VSD relates with previous literature in Social Signal Processing and indicate which existing Computer Vision methods can be used to manage such problem. We conclude with future challenges related to the effectiveness of VSD systems, ethical implications and future application scenarios.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cristani, Marco; Bue, Alessio Del; Murino, Vittorio; Setti, Francesco; Vinciarelli, Alessandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c79223d2bcf821a3fdc1e1d723d64133ab1ebc0d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04813v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Visual Social Distancing","VSD","Social Signal Processing"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["minimum inter-personal distance","effectiveness of VSD systems","so-called Social Distancing","Visual Social Distancing","distance limitations","physical constraint","problem","related people aggregations","Social Signal Processing","possible breaks","future challenges","possible threat","SD restriction","future application scenarios","ethical implications","maintenance","restrictions","transports","recent viral outbreak","public institutions","previous literature","automatic estimation","effective measures","existing Computer Vision methods","level of safety","schools","statistics","specific areas","workplaces","characterization","non-invasive analysis","image","privacy policies","measurement acceptable","scene context","reasons","compliance","order","life","actual scenario","end"],"language":"en"},

In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\u0022risk\u0022and\u0022spread\u0022), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent super spreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic\u0022friendship paradox\u0022-- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allard, Antoine; Moore, Cristopher; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Althouse, Benjamin M.; H\u0027ebert-Dufresne, Laurent","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/010d6e911db7b0ed6fdfe2f2bf0b861d31971b52.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11283v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["models of epidemic spread","high spread","backward contact tracing","types of individuals","mass-action models","forward links","backward links lead","contact tracing strategy","structured SIR models","backward version","complex contact patterns","directed structure","high risk","types of heterogeneity","theory of random directed graphs","standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models","superspreading events","simplest mass-action model","epidemic size","social networks","super spreading events","future cascades of infection","joint distributions of various kinds","interventions","friendship paradox","reproductive number","deviation","activity","age","classic","contacts","important quantities","possible policy implications","mixtures of Poisson processes","results","assumption","disease","combination","direction","correlation","degrees","COVID"],"language":"en"},

A critical assessment through the case of Italy","doi":null,"pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"arxiv","abstract":"As the COVID-19 outbreak is developing the two most frequently reported statistics seem to be the raw confirmed case and case fatalities counts. Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15th-22nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus\u0027s dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15th April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10th May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work we do not fit models but we rather investigate whether this task is possible at all.

However, assessing these interactions with surveys fails to capture their dynamic nature. While these behaviors can be captured with client-based passive sensing, these techniques are limited in scalability. By contrast, infrastructure-based approaches can scale to a large cohort and infer social interactions based on collocation of students. This paper investigates one such approach by leveraging WiFi association logs archived by a managed campus network. In their raw form, access point logs can approximate a student\u0027s location but with low spatio-temporal resolution. This paper first demonstrates that processing these logs can infer the collocation of 46 students in 34 lectures over 3 months, with a precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.75. Next, we investigate how this WiFi-based coarse collocation reflects signals of social interaction. With 163 students in 54 project groups, we find that member performance shows a correlation of 0.75 with performance determined from collocation of groups through 14 weeks. Additionally, this paper presents preliminary insights for other campus-centric applications of automatically inferred social interactions.

The challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections are compounded by the geographic heterogeneity of the population. To address this problem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The setting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency of contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may change over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other communities where the infection is present. To account for these important aspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact between its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census and cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network, which can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation measures. In order to make the network SEIR model that we propose easy to customize, it is formulated in terms of easily interpretable parameters that can be estimated from available community level data. The models parameters are estimated with Bayesian techniques using COVID-19 data for the states of Ohio and Michigan. The network model also gives rise to a geographically distributed computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion, e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvetti, Daniela; Hoover, Alexander; Rose, Johnie; Somersalo, Erkki","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0ad00ae0e1491027e3adb0c32d77f57cfcfd578.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06137v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["network model","account","network SEIR model","models parameters","model parameters","distributed models","rural areas","frequency of contact","human contact","nested SEIR models","distributed computational model","Mathematical models of SARS","SARS-CoV","available community level data","contagion","interpretable parameters","cell phone data","geographic dynamics","influx of individuals","urban settings","uninfected community","geographic heterogeneity","level of connectivity","design of mitigation steps","different levels of mitigation measures","impending breaches of health care system surge capacity","distinct local cohorts","pandemic","Bayesian techniques","rise","fact","new infections","larger cities","lacunary information","virus spreads","communities","COVID","members","differences","states of Ohio","Census","transmission","order","important aspects","Michigan","challenges","probability","nodes","population","terms","adjacency matrix","time","problem","turn"],"language":"en"},

A simple way to evaluate the development and efficacy of control is described and shown to provide a useful measure for the future evolution of an epidemic. This may contribute to improve strategic response from the government. The evaluation process here is universal and therefore applicable to many similar homogeneous epidemic diseases within a fixed population. A novel model consisting of map systems involving the Small-World network principle is also described. We find that this model reproduces qualitative features of the random disease propagation observed in the true data.

While these strategies have effectively dealt with the critical situations of outbreaks, the combination of the pandemic and mobility controls has slowed China\u0027s economic growth, resulting in the first quarterly decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since GDP began to be calculated, in 1992. To characterize the potential shrinkage of the domestic economy, from the perspective of mobility, we propose two new economic indicators: the New Venues Created (NVC) and the Volumes of Visits to Venue (V^3), as the complementary measures to domestic investments and consumption activities, using the data of Baidu Maps. The historical records of these two indicators demonstrated strong correlations with the past figures of Chinese GDP, while the status quo has dramatically changed this year, due to the pandemic. We hereby presented a quantitative analysis to project the impact of the pandemic on economies, using the recent trends of NVC and V^3. We found that the most affected sectors would be travel-dependent businesses, such as hotels, educational institutes, and public transportation, while the sectors that are mandatory to human life, such as workplaces, residential areas, restaurants, and shopping sites, have been recovering rapidly.

Overall, while this conversion may technically be possible, poor gas transport likely requires multiple HD membranes for one patient.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Abhimanyu; Robinson, Matthew L.; Warsinger, D.

However, the inverse problem of backward diffusion is known to be ill-posed and straightforward numerical algorithms are unstable. So far, existing stabilisation strategies in the literature require sophisticated numerics to solve the underlying initial value problem. Therefore, it is desirable to establish a backward diffusion model which implements a smart stabilisation approach that can be used in combination with a simple numerical scheme. We derive a class of space-discrete one-dimensional backward diffusion as gradient descent of energies where we gain stability by imposing range constraints. Interestingly, these energies are even convex. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive theory for the time-continuous evolution and we show that stability carries over to a simple explicit time discretisation of our model. Finally, we confirm the stability and usefulness of our technique in experiments in which we enhance the contrast of digital greyscale and colour images.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bergerhoff, Leif; C\u0027ardenas, Marcelo; Weickert, Joachim; Welk, Martin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90d56dc714661b333088d2ef9f39864b492dc2b4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03491v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["backward diffusion model","Backward diffusion processes","stability","inverse problem of backward diffusion","discrete one-dimensional backward diffusion","simple numerical scheme","simple explicit time discretisation","gradient descent of energies","straightforward numerical algorithms","time-continuous evolution","smart stabilisation approach","existing stabilisation strategies","underlying initial value problem","sophisticated numerics","image enhancement","literature","class of space","contrast of digital greyscale","colour images","combination","comprehensive theory","imposing range constraints","experiments","deblurring applications","usefulness","technique"],"language":"en"},

Findings: The main themes identified for the 87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life; attitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with COVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research limitations/implications: Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers, and helped each other to cope with social isolation. A few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government messages sometimes failed. Practical implications: Public health campaigns in future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support campaign goals. At a methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised politics and ignored practical implementation issues.

The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting Covid-19 cases using chest X-rays. Therefore, in this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect Covid-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The deep model called CoroNet has been trained and tested on a dataset prepared by collecting Covid-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. The experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.5%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for Covid-19 cases are 97% and 100%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available.

In this paper, we collate a large data repository containing COVID-19 information from a range of different sources. We use this data to develop several predictors and prediction intervals for forecasting the short-term (e.g., over the next week) trajectory of COVID-19-related recorded deaths at the county-level in the United States. Specifically, using data from January 22, 2020, to May 10, 2020, we produce several different predictors and combine their forecasts using ensembling techniques, resulting in an ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our individual predictors include county-specific exponential and linear predictors, an exponential predictor that pools data together across counties, and a demographics-based exponential predictor. In addition, we use the largest prediction errors in the past five days to assess the uncertainty of our death predictions, resulting in prediction intervals that we refer to as Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction Intervals (MEPI). We show that MEPI is an effective method in practice with a 94.5\\% coverage rate when averaged across counties.

However, literature findings indicate that most mask designs do not provide reliable protection. This paper investigates the hypothesis that the impaired protection is mainly due to imperfect fitting of the masks, so that airflow, which contains virus-transporting droplets, can leak through gaps into or out of the mask. The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient 2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that already gap heights larger than 0.1mm can result in the mask not fulfilling FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1mm most of the airflow and droplets may pass through the gap. The implications of these findings are discussed and improvements to existing mask designs are suggested.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peri\u0027c, Robinson; Peri\u0027c, Milovan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04c1f9b198ded294d0bb80dcc8c51bb2cce2ecd4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08800v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D-flow simulations","D-flow models","gap heights of","existing mask designs","use of face masks","literature findings","droplets","airflow","fluid dynamics of face masks","impaired protection","virus transmission","reliable protection","heights larger","present results","FFP3 standards","general public","global COVID","improvements","imperfect fitting","hypothesis","FFP2","means","numerical computations","paper","pandemic","gaps","implications"],"language":"en"},

This note emphasizes the crucial delay of two weeks between infection and listing of infection in a central database. Our estimates of the time course of Covid-19 activity and reproduction rates can reduce the information gap by several days. We show that Spain and Germany are already beyond the turning point. In general the estimated reproduction rates become undercritical a short time after the main lockdown measures, and the Covid-19 activity starts to decrease afterwards.

As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, gonorrhea, influenza, Zika, measles, polio, whooping cough, and mumps--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for time series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences in predictability across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches to prediction and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long disease time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scarpino, Samuel V.; Petri, Giovanni","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03cc61010171d8c71d4350f18d7c57e8b90cd5bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07317v4.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Infectious disease outbreaks","implying prediction","long disease time series","question of outbreak prediction","time scale of single outbreaks","practice of disease","model independent measure of predictability","predictability of complex adaptive systems","model selection","model structures","fundamental entropy barrier","different components of outbreaks","growing field of epidemiological forecasting","broad set of infectious diseases","diverse collection of historical outbreaks","presence of fundamental limits","complex systems approach","permutation entropy","tempo of cases","likely mechanisms","expected number of cases","information theoretic limits","dynamic modeling approaches","pathogens","polio","measles","pace","challenges","social network heterogeneity","Zika","treatment","gonorrhea","observed differences","testing","multi-level interaction of hosts","whooping cough","importation probability","influenza","mumps","biology","contagions","importance","Recent studies","shared environment","forecast horizon","science","results","findings"],"language":"en"},

The analysis describes appropriately the infection curve for Germany. The model is applied to predict an infection curve for Cuba, which estimates a maximum number of infected as less than 2000 in the middle of May, depending on the rigor of the isolation. This is suggested by the ratio between the daily detected cases and the total. We consider the ratio between the observed and real infected cases (k) less than unity. The low value of k decreases the maximum obtained when $\\beta^*-\\gamma\u003E0$. The observed evolution is independent of k in the linear region. The value of $\\beta^*$ is also studied by time intervals, adjusting to the data of Cuba, Germany and South Korea. We compare the extrapolation of the evolution of Cuba with the contagion rate until 16.04.20 with that obtained by a strict quarantine at the end of April. This model with variable $\\beta^*$ correctly describes the observed infected evolution curves. We emphasize that the desired maximum of the SIR infected curve is not the maximum standard with constant $\\beta^*$, but one achieved due to quarantine when $\\tilde R_0=\\beta^*/\\gamma\u003C1$.

Due to the large number of affected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the numbers of training data.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Hengyuan; Xia, Liming; Yan, Fuhua; Wan, Zhibin; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Sui, He; Zhang, Changqing; Shen, Dinggang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccaec82634891b11a2daaabc922a883819c886f9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03227v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COVID","different aspects of features","series of features","multiple features","highdimensional features","type of features","CT images","diagnosis process","different views","computer-aided diagnosis","different types of pneumonia","large margin","unified latent representation","promising class structure","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","large number of affected patients","heavy labor","doctors","proposed method","comparison methods","machine learning algorithm","CAP","group of backward neural networks","Extensive experimental results","stable performances","separability","Chest computed tomography","case","community","informative tool","information","efforts of clinicians","numbers of training data","model","overfitting","classes","way","completeness","world","study"],"language":"en"},

Whereas there remains the question of how we can protect ourselves from being infected while helping others by donating resources in fighting against the epidemic. To answer the question, we propose a novel resource allocation model by considering the awareness of self-protection of individuals. In the model, a tuning parameter is introduced to quantify the reaction strength of individuals when they are aware of the disease. And then, a coupled model of resource allocation and disease spreading is proposed to study the impact of self-awareness on resource allocation and, its impact on the dynamics of epidemic spreading. Through theoretical analysis and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that in the stationary state, the system converges to two states: the whole healthy or the completely infected, which indicates an abrupt increase in the prevalence when there is a shortage of resources. More importantly, we find that too cautious and too selfless for the people during the outbreak of an epidemic are both not suitable for disease control. Through extensive simulations, we find the optimal point, at which there is a maximum value of the epidemic threshold, and an outbreak can be delayed to the greatest extent. At last, we study further the effects of network structure on the coupled dynamics. We find that the degree heterogeneity promotes the outbreak of disease, and the network structure does not alter the optimal phenomenon in behavior response.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaolong; Liu, Quanhui; Wang, Ruijie; Li, Qing; Wang, Wei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/498ac6766188dfb4f108d7feddccd346648f25a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02607v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease spreading","outbreak of disease","dynamics of epidemic spreading","coupled model of resource allocation","epidemic threshold","novel resource allocation model","Resource support","disease control","extensive simulations","coupled dynamics","question","effects of network structure","reaction strength of individuals","extensive Monte Carlo simulations","optimal phenomenon","impact of self-awareness","optimal point","shortage of resources","theoretical analysis","particular importance","people","awareness of self-protection","system","prevalence","abrupt increase","behavior response","maximum value","degree heterogeneity","tuning parameter","stationary state","states","fighting","pandemics","greatest extent"],"language":"en"},

Inactivation of YopH activity would lead to the loss of bacterial pathogenicity. We have studied the inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) against YopH phosphatase and found that at nanomolar concentrations ATA reversibly decreases the activity of YopH. Computational docking studies indicated that in all binding poses ATA binds in the YopH active site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the predicted binding pose, ATA binds to the essential Cys403 and Arg409 residues in the active site and has a stronger binding affinity than the natural substrate (pTyr). The cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that ATA reacts remarkably strongly with molecular oxygen. Additionally, the electrochemical reduction of ATA in the presence of a negative potential from \u22122.0 to 2.5 V generates a current signal, which is observed for hydrogen peroxide. Here we showed that ATA indicates a unique mechanism of YopH inactivation due to a redox process. We proposed that the potent inhibitory properties of ATA are a result of its strong binding in the YopH active site and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide near catalytic cysteine residue.","publish_time":"2015-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuban-Jankowska, Alicja; Sahu, Kamlesh K; Niedzialkowski, Pawel; Gorska, Magdalena; Tuszynski, Jack A; Ossowski, Tadeusz; Wozniak, Michal","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4621896.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4621896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YopH phosphatase","activity of YopH","YopH active site","binding poses ATA binds","Inactivation of YopH activity","nanomolar concentrations ATA","electrochemical reduction of ATA","potent inhibitory properties of ATA","unique mechanism of YopH inactivation","strong binding","stronger binding affinity","predicted binding pose","essential Cys403","situ generation of hydrogen peroxide","inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid","bacterial protein tyrosine phosphatase","molecular oxygen","loss of bacterial pathogenicity","Molecular dynamics simulations","Arg409 residues","plague","natural substrate","catalytic cysteine residue","presence","result","pathogenic virulence","viability","Yersinia","pTyr","negative potential","Computational docking studies","cyclic voltammetry experiments","redox process","current signal"],"language":"en"},

This second part provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms and targets of still-experimental drugs for the treatment and management of influenza. Briefly, we can distinguish between compounds with anti-influenza activity that target influenza virus proteins or genes, and molecules that target host components that are essential for viral replication and propagation. These latter compounds have been developed quite recently. Among the first group, we will focus especially on hemagglutinin, M2 channel and neuraminidase inhibitors. The second group of compounds may pave the way for personalized treatment and influenza management. Combination therapies are also discussed. In recent decades, few antiviral molecules against influenza virus infections have been available; this has conditioned their use during human and animal outbreaks. Indeed, during seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, antiviral drugs have usually been administered in mono-therapy and, sometimes, in an uncontrolled manner to farm animals. This has led to the emergence of viral strains displaying resistance, especially to compounds of the amantadane family. For this reason, it is particularly important to develop new antiviral drugs against influenza viruses. Indeed, although vaccination is the most powerful means of mitigating the effects of influenza epidemics, antiviral drugs can be very useful, particularly in delaying the spread of new pandemic viruses, thereby enabling manufacturers to prepare large quantities of pandemic vaccine. In addition, antiviral drugs are particularly valuable in complicated cases of influenza, especially in hospitalized patients. To write this overview, we mined various databases, including Embase, PubChem, DrugBank and Chemical Abstracts Service, and patent repositories.","publish_time":"2014-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"GASPARINI, R.; AMICIZIA, D.; LAI, P.L.; BRAGAZZI, N.L.; PANATTO, D.","journal":"J Prev Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/544a005c6288491bc6229435fddcdec62d6e24b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4718316.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4718316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical Abstracts Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of influenza","influenza management","influenza viruses","influenza virus proteins","influenza virus infections","new antiviral drugs","available drugs","anti-influenza activity","complicated cases of influenza","effects of influenza epidemics","antiviral molecules","experimental drugs","overview","group of compounds","pandemic outbreaks","spread of new pandemic viruses","personalized treatment","viral replication","large quantities of pandemic vaccine","animal outbreaks","emergence of viral strains","PubChem","Chemical Abstracts Service","manufacturers","way","Embase","DrugBank","host components","targets","genes","pharmacological action","hemagglutinin","M2 channel","neuraminidase inhibitors","patent repositories","various databases","life cycle","powerful means","molecular mechanisms","recent decades","resistance","propagation","addition","hospitalized patients","uncontrolled manner","animals","vaccination","mono-therapy","Combination therapies","amantadane family","reason"],"language":"en"},

We examined whether polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus were related to the risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) among Chinese populations. In the first stage, 26 tag SNPs were genotyped in a Guangxi population (855 patients and 1036 controls). In the second stage, the SNPs, which showed significant association, were further genotyped in a Guangdong population (997 patients and 972 controls). Functional analyses were conducted to verify the biological relevance of the associated polymorphism. In the 1st stage, four SNPs (rs2736098, rs2735845, rs402710, and rs401681) were significantly associated with the risk of developing NPC. After the 2nd stage validation, rs2735845 and rs401681 were independently associated with the risk of developing NPC in the additive model (rs2735845, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04\u20131.37, P = 0.011; rs401681, OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74\u20130.99, P = 0.034). Furthermore, we observed higher CLPTM1L messenger RNA levels in fetal mesenchymal stem cells from the rs2735845 G allele carriers compared with that from non-carriers. In addition, using an immunohistochemistry assay, we observed higher TERT and CLPTM1L levels in NPC tissues compared with that in non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissues. Our findings suggest that polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus may play a role in mediating the susceptibility to NPC in Chinese populations.","publish_time":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yang; Zhang, Xiaoai; Zhang, Hongxing; Zhai, Yun; Wang, Zhifu; Li, Peiyao; Yu, Lixia; Xia, Xia; Zhang, Ying; Zeng, Yixin; He, Fuchu; Zhou, Gangqiao","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2810296105b6ae2ca21d299d27f83c6d1b071f28.json; document_parses/pdf_json/786da349a33148e24e09edd6378da80ea2f40e07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4808031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPC"],"locations":["Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["TERT-CLPTM1L locus","risk of developing NPC","CLPTM1L levels","NPC tissues","higher TERT","rs401681","tag SNPs","stage validation","higher CLPTM1L messenger RNA levels","rs2735845 G allele carriers","non-carriers","Chinese populations","patients","controls","associated polymorphism","non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissues","single nucleotide polymorphisms","nasopharyngeal carcinoma","Guangxi population","Guangdong population","fetal mesenchymal stem cells","5p15","additive model","immunohistochemistry assay","Associations","susceptibility","rs402710","role","rs2736098","multiple cancer types","biological relevance","addition","significant association","findings","Functional analyses"],"language":"en"},

N95 respirators are the most common respirators used in the health care system and negligence in using them may cause health problems. Hence, more emphasis should be on ergonomic aspects of this mask. This study aimed to develop a tool for ergonomic evaluation of these respirators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After reviewing previous studies and employees\u2019 problems in the use of the N95 respirators, 50 questionnaires were designed and their validity was assessed. Then, the questionnaire was completed by 290 staff members of Masih Daneshvari Hospital and its internal consistency and reproducibility were investigated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient and test-retest method, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess its consistency and internal consistency (construct validity). RESULTS: With the confirmation of the face and content validities, internal consistency (0.89) calculated by the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient and reproducibility of the questionnaire (0.997; p\u003C0.001) assessed by using the ICC Index, were approved. Following examining internal consistency and stability, the questionnaire convergent construct validity was also confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire contained 42 items and it is beneficial to use it in the health care system to evaluate the ergonomic problems of the respirators and to have optimal choice in this respect. Also, it can be used in the promotion of the staffs\u2019 behavior in wearing these respirators when necessary.","publish_time":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jazani, Reza Khani; Seyedmehdi, Seyed Mohammad; Kavousi, Amir; Javazm, Somaye Tahernezhad","journal":"Tanaffos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35229a458e5e6c73b9bcc155eedb15c62a24ce17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6534796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6534796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Masih Daneshvari Hospital","Cronbach"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N95 respirators","common respirators","health problems","examining internal consistency","health care system","ergonomic problems","Health care workers","questionnaire convergent construct validity","reproducibility","Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient","ergonomic aspects","employees\u2019 problems","ergonomic evaluation","Confirmatory factor analysis","use","stability","infectious diseases","high risk of exposure","staff members of Masih Daneshvari Hospital","previous studies","face","content validities","test-retest method","confirmation","tool","negligence","airborne transmission","staffs\u2019 behavior","METHODS","items","optimal choice","BACKGROUND","questionnaires","respect","promotion","MATERIALS","emphasis","mask","CONCLUSION","ICC Index","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of the sequences around 40 unique recombination sites reveals several features that differ significantly from those expected of randomly located sites. These features, which include a broad zone of elevated homology on the 3\u0027 side of the cross-over, support the theory that RNA recombination occurs by a template-switching mechanism during synthesis of the complementary strand, and that sites are chosen to minimise the adverse free energy change involved in switching to a heterotypic template.

These features shed new light on the extent of base-pairing in replicative intermediate RNA, and on the mechanism of chain initiation.","publish_time":"1988-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"King, A M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC339105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["features","RNA recombination","single strand of RNA","unique recombination sites","replicative intermediate RNA","complementary strand","synthesis of UU","thirds of cross","heterotypic template","mechanism of chain initiation","extent of base","overs","new light","sequences","adverse free energy change","broad zone of elevated homology","computer simulation","Analysis","theory","strong sequence bias","genome of poliovirus"],"language":"en"},

In the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the gag and pol genes overlap by 241 nucleotides with pol in the -1 phase with respect to gag. The gag-pol fusion is produced via a -1 ribosomal frameshifting event that brings the overlapping, out-of-phase gag and pol genes into translational phase. Frameshifting occurs at a so called \u0027shift site\u0027 8-10 nucleotides upstream of a hairpin loop which may play a role in the regulation of frameshifting. We have fused this region of HIV-1 to the 5\u0027 end of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in order to quantitatively measure ribosomal frameshifting both in cells and by in vitro translation. A series of 2\u0027-O-methyl oligonucleotides was designed to specifically bind the sequences which flank the gag-pol hairpin. Ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced up to 6 fold by those oligonucleotides which bind the area just 3 to the stem. Oligonucleotides which bind 5\u0027 to the stem have no effect on frameshift efficiency. In addition, we have constructed a series of fusion genes which mimic the effect of the bound oligonucleotides with intramolecular hairpins. The results suggest that increasing RNA secondary structure downstream of the shift site increases the frequency of ribosomal frameshifting, and that this effect can be mimicked by antisense oligonucleotides.","publish_time":"1992-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vickers, T A; Ecker, D J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC334071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pol genes","gag-pol hairpin","phase gag","gag-pol fusion protein","frequency of ribosomal frameshifting","ribosomal frameshifting event","regulation of frameshifting","effect","bound oligonucleotides","antisense oligonucleotides","series of fusion genes","O-methyl oligonucleotides","translational phase","shift site","stem","hairpin loop","region of HIV","firefly luciferase reporter gene","order","increasing RNA secondary structure","results","end","role","overlapping","intramolecular hairpins","human immunodeficiency virus","frameshift efficiency","cells","retroviruses","area","respect","fold","sequences","viral enzymes","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. METHODS: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). RESULTS: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3\u00B1 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test.

The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic. The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure. COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells. Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells. Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases. In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time. However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Angel-Korman, Avital; Brosh, Tal; Glick, Karina; Leiba, Adi","journal":"Harefuah","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307955/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["penetration of COVID","INTRODUCTION COVID","severe cases","respiratory failure","enzyme ACE2","virus manifests","pandemic","new corona virus","medical staff","enzyme abundant","lower respiratory tract infection","risk of infection","community based dialysis units","hemodialysis patients","setting of chronic kidney disease","acute kidney injury","unique group of patients","multi organ failure","renal tubular epithelial cells","hospital","diabetes","fever","Beta Coronavirus genus","logistic challenge","AKI","ways","cough","previous diagnoses","ACE inhibitors","RAAS inhibition","ARBs","dyspnea","high prevalence of hypertension","human cell","bats","World Health Organization","microhematuria","proteinuria","medications","life","treatment","time","source","China","areas"],"language":"en"},

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020. RESULTS All 9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children. Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea. There were only symptoms of the respiratory system. Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count. Among the 9 children, 6 had an increase in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count. CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near the interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass opacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign. CONCLUSIONS Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Chest CT has guiding significance for the early diagnosis of asymptomatic children.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yun; Yang, Gen-Dong; Feng, Kai; Huang, Hua; Yun, Yong-Xing; Mou, Xin-Yan; Wang, Li-Fei","journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32204756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["young children","infected children","diagnosis of COVID","early diagnosis of asymptomatic children","CT examination","chest CT images","patchy lesions","imaging findings","nodular lesions","leukocyte count","lymphocyte count","chest CT findings of coronavirus disease","mild clinical symptoms","clinical features","clinical data","epidemiological history","nucleic acid detection","increase","CONCLUSIONS Infants","typical paving stone sign","Laboratory examination","halo sign","ground glass opacity","reductions","significance","consolidation","family clustering","pleura","retrospective analysis","interlobar fissure","pulmonary inflammation","cough","METHODS","fever","respiratory system","OBJECTIVE","bronchovascular bundles","adults","years","rhinorrhea","morphology"],"language":"en"},

What should I tell parents worried about their children contracting the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19, and what symptoms should I look for to determine if there is a need to test for the virus?Answer The COVID-19 global pandemic affects all ages. Severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults, with what seems to be rapid deterioration necessitating mechanical ventilation. Only 5% of those tested and found to have COVID-19 have been younger than 19 years, possibly owing to limited testing, as the symptoms in children are usually mild. Symptoms in children include fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and fatigue, and in 10% diarrhea or vomiting. Rarely dyspnea or hypoxemia were also described. Blood tests and imaging have been shown to be of little value in children and should only be ordered for those in whom you would normally order these investigations for viral-like illness. No specific therapy is available and supportive care with rest, fluids, and antipyretics for children is the recommended approach. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and pain can be given. Antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment is not recommended at this time for otherwise healthy children, and corticosteroids should also not be used.

Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only interrupt an organisation\u0027s operations and compromise long-term viability of an enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees\u0027 and customers\u0027 health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community and economy.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koonin, Lisa M","journal":"Journal of business continuity \u0026 emergency planning","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic plans","businesses","address pandemic preparedness","potential infectious disease pandemic","business continuity plans","critical healthcare","provision of critical functions","current growing spread of coronavirus disease","influenza","essential component","novel corona virus","safety","employees\u0027","customers\u0027 health","key role","long-term viability","COVID","harmful impacts","organisations","organisation\u0027s operations","infrastructure services","negative impact","enterprise","article","practical steps","world","community","case","people","epidemic","economy","communities","Pandemics"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare,the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jincheng; Liu, Jinpeng; Wang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Wei; Chen, Xiaoqun; Sun, Chao; Shen, Xiaoyong; Wang, Qidong; Wu, Yaping; Liang, Wenjie; Ruan, Lingxiang","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age \u003E60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khot, Wasim Yunus; Nadkar, Milind Y","journal":"The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32138488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","COVID","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission dynamics","nosocomial transmission","Isolation of symptomatic cases","COVID","transmissible disease","management","severe life threatening disease","Bacterial co-infection","appropriate clinical background","Standard infection control","varying transmission patterns","severe pneumonia","chest imaging","Novel Corona virus infection","Vigilant screening of suspected cases","investigation tools","international co-ordination","spectrum of clinical features","home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts","testing of appropriate respiratory samples","ongoing public health emergency of international significance","ARDS","Smoking history","Lymphopenia","consolidation","major complications","Multilobular infiltration","Chronic medical conditions","epidemiology","acute cardiac injury","Hypertension","Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity","newer antivirals","lopinavir ritonavir","Poor prognostic factors","PCR","Remdesivir","septic shock","evolution","years","significant knowledge gaps","prevention techniques","suspicion","new coronavirus epidemic","MuLBSTA score","available evidence","area of concern","Role of steroids","article","decades","Diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

Cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one. However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu, may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wicke, Philipp; Bolognesi, Marianna M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04fc9f631e698a53691d96eaf89141354420539d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06986v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WAR frame","related discourse","public discourse","WAR framing","FAMILY literal frame","use of war","Covid","War-related terminology","figurative framings WAR","social media","current epidemic","related metaphors","civilians","tweets","current pandemic","corpus","current situation","communication of various aspects","specific topics","virus treatment","alternative figurative frames","plethora of framing options","effects of social distancing","non-experts of mass communication","STORM","MONSTER","opinions","TSUNAMI","wider portion","previous suggestions","weeks","trenches","feelings","ideas","metaphor menu","new invisible enemy","nurses","line","population","expression","control","Doctors","spreading","homes","topic modelling","results","epidemics","diseases","analysis","popularity","Cities","Twitter"],"language":"en"},

Their positions rely upon a set of studies and experience about outbreaks and transmission mechanisms in Africa as well as assumptions about what those studies imply about outbreaks in the US. According to this view the probability of a single infection is low and that of a major outbreak is non-existent. In a series of brief reports we will provide insight into why properties of networks of contagion that are not considered in traditional statistics suggest that risks are higher than those assumptions suggest. We begin with the difference between thin and fat tailed distributions applied to the number of infected individuals that can arise from a single one. Traditional epidemiological models consider the contagion process as described by $R_0$, the average number of new infected individuals arising from a single case. However, in a complex interdependent society it is possible for the actual number due to a single individual to dramatically differ from the average number, with severe consequences for the ability to contain an outbreak when it is just beginning. Our analysis raises doubts about the scientific validity of policy recommendations of public health authorities.

We compare the solution to these equations, uSEIR, to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases with the uSEIR solution.

Our evaluation reveals that the extension which retains the original noise model of the noisy images and additionally has a comprehensive connectivity of 2D and temporal image information at both pixel and patch levels, gives the best results. Additionally, we find a surprising change in performance of one the four extensions due to the specific application of the VST.

The current gold standard method for COVID-19 detection is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application. The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving, the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based technology solutions for point-of-care diagnosis of respiratory infection, and in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Neeraj; Krishnan, Prashant; Kumar, Rohit; Ramoji, Shreyas; Chetupalli, Srikanth Raj; Nirmala, R.; Ghosh, Prasanta Kumar; Ganapathy, Sriram","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a98ddaa12f12752a8c36c7191b68485870f5b204.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10548v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic","respiratory sounds","analysis of Coswara","cough","prominent symptoms of COVID","care diagnosis of respiratory infection","alternate diagnosis tool","sound samples","useful insights","diagnostic tool","sound based technology solutions","current gold standard method","detection","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","point","boundaries of country","global challenges","race","worldwide crowdsourcing","machine learning techniques","religion","work","design","limitations","data collection","curated dataset","open access","website application","testing","near future","breath","need","social distancing","paper","early effort","large scale","economy","voice","progress","database","difficulties"],"language":"en"},

Many countries and research groups have launched or announced mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users\u0027 phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users. In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of users\u0027 contacts from both central services and other users, and provides protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients have small input sets and the server\u0027s database of tokens is much larger.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trieu, Ni; Shehata, Kareem; Saxena, Prateek; Shokri, Reza; Song, Dawn","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13293v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Epione alerts users","privacy of users\u0027 contacts","case of large-scale contact tracing","end-to-end privacy","intersection items","privacy considerations","querying of tokens","released tokens","random tokens","private sets","linkage attacks","intersection size","strong privacy protections","set of items","server\u0027s database of tokens","prior approaches","false reporting","secure two-party private set intersection cardinality","essential tool","users\u0027 phones","Prior systems","small input sets","new cryptographic tool","clients","token metadata","PSI-CA","lightweight system","mobile apps","central services","infectious diseases","collection","research groups","key building block","encounters","countries","COVID","parties","focus","order","proximity","work"],"language":"en"},

The adoption of social distancing and heavy lockdown measures is posing a heavy burden on the population and the economy. The timing of the measures has crucial policy-making implications. Using publicly available data for the pandemic progression in Italy, we quantitatively assess the effect of the intervention time on the pandemic expansion, with a methodology that combines a generalized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model together with statistical learning methods. The modeling shows that the lockdown has strongly deviated the pandemic trajectory in Italy. However, the difference between the forecasts and real data up to 20 April 2020 can be explained only by the existence of a time lag between the actual issuance date and the full effect of the measures. To understand the relative importance of intervention with respect to other factors, a thorough uncertainty quantification of the model predictions is performed. Global sensitivity indices show that the the time of intervention is 4 times more relevant than quarantine, and eight times more important than intrinsic features of the pandemic such as protection and infection rates. The relevance of their interactions is also quantified and studied.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borgonovo, Emanuele; Lu, Xuefei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f13edf13cdb5709fadd85c3c420567edae637b7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01833v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intervention time","time of intervention","pandemic progression","pandemic expansion","pandemic trajectory","Italy","heavy lockdown measures","times","time lag","effect","relative importance of intervention","heavy burden","model predictions","real data","available data","thorough uncertainty quantification","respect","factors","actual issuance date","adoption of social distancing","intrinsic features","SEIR","crucial policy","methodology","protection","quarantine","statistical learning methods","difference","forecasts","population","timing","implications","infection rates","Global sensitivity indices","economy","existence","COVID","relevance","interactions","countries","modeling"],"language":"en"},

The molecular interaction study revealed that Rifampin (-16.3 kcal/mol) were topmost inhibitor of MPP where Azobechalcone were found most potent plant therapeutics for blocking the RdRp (-15.9 kcal /mol) and S (-14.4 kcal/mol) protein of SARS-CoV-2. After the comparative analysis of all docking results, Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline were exhibited as the most potential inhibitory plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, amino acid positions; H41, C145, and M165 of MPP played crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where F368, L371, L372, A375, W509, L514, Y515 were pivotal for RdRP. In addition, the drug interaction surface of S proteins also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum inhibitors.

One of the effective protection methods for human beings is to wear masks in public areas. Furthermore, many public service providers require customers to use the service only if they wear masks correctly. However, there are only a few research studies about face mask detection. To contribute to public healthcare for human beings, we propose RetinaMask, which is a high-accuracy and efficient face mask detector. The proposed RetinaMask is a one-stage detector, which consists of a feature pyramid network to fuse high-level semantic information with multiple feature maps, and a novel context attention module to focus on detecting face masks. In addition, we also propose a novel cross-class object removal algorithm to reject predictions with low confidences and the high intersection of union. Experimental results show that RetinaMask achieves state-of-the-art results on a public face mask dataset with 2.3% and 1.5% higher than the baseline result in the face and mask detection precision, respectively, and $11.0\\%$ and $5.9\\%$ higher than baseline for recall.

We present an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations.

Karn","doi":"10.1006/jmbi.1997.1134","pmcid":"PMC7126968","pubmed_id":"9237903","license":"els-covid","abstract":"Abstract Eukaryotic ribosomal frameshift signals generally contain two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (XXXYYYN) and an RNA secondary structure, often an RNA pseudoknot, located downstream. Frameshifting takes place at the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of two ribosome-bound tRNAs. All of the tRNAs that are predicted to decode frameshift sites in the ribosomal A-site (XXXY YYN ) possess a hypermodified base in the anticodon-loop and it is conceivable that these modifications play a role in the frameshift process. To test this, we expressed slippery sequence variants of the coronavirus IBV frameshift signal in strains of Escherichia coli unable to modify fully either tRNALys or tRNAAsn. At the slippery sequences UUUA AAC and UUUA AAU (underlined codon decoded by tRNAAsn, anticodon 5\u2032 QUU 3\u2032), frameshifting was very inefficient (2 to 3%) and in strains deficient in the biosynthesis of Q base, was increased (AAU) or decreased (AAC) only two-fold. In E. coli, therefore, hypomodification of tRNAAsn had little effect on frameshifting. The situation with the efficient slippery sequences UUUA AAA (15%) and UUUA AAG (40%) (underlined codon decoded by tRNALys, anticodon 5\u2032 mnm5s2UUU 3\u2032) was more complex, since the wobble base of tRNALys is modified at two positions. Of four available mutants, only trmE (s2UUU) had a marked influence on frameshifting, increasing the efficiency of the process at the slippery sequence UUUA AAA . No effect on frameshifting was seen in trmC1 (cmnm5s2UUU) or trmC2 (nm5s2UUU) strains and only a very small reduction (at UUUA AAG ) was observed in an asuE (mnm5UUU) strain. The slipperiness of tRNALys, therefore, cannot be ascribed to a single modification site on the base. However, the data support a role for the amino group of the mnm5 substitution in shaping the anticodon structure. Whether these conclusions can be extended to eukaryotic translation systems is uncertain. Although E. coli ribosomes changed frame at the IBV signal (UUUAAAG) with an efficiency similar to that measured in reticulocyte lysates (40%), there were important qualitative differences. Frameshifting of prokaryotic ribosomes was pseudoknot-independent (although secondary structure dependent) and appeared to require slippage of only a single tRNA.","publish_time":"1997-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brierley, Ian; Meredith, Michayla R; Bloys, Alison J; Hagervall, Tord G","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28ef2f6aa0e0c14f92055d24d72b151fd4da910a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126968.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283697911347; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283697911347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["RNA","IBV","Escherichia","UUUA AAU","UUUA AAA","UUUA AAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["slippery sequence UUUA AAA","UUUA AAU","slippery sequences UUUA AAC","UUUA AAG","slippery sequence variants","heptanucleotide slippery sequence","anticodon structure","efficient slippery sequences UUUA AAA","frameshift process","wobble base of tRNALys","Frameshifting of prokaryotic ribosomes","frameshift sites","hypermodified base","anticodon-loop","coli ribosomes","slipperiness of tRNALys","RNA secondary structure","coronavirus IBV frameshift signal","IBV signal","underlined codon","Abstract Eukaryotic ribosomal frameshift signals","strains deficient","strains of Escherichia coli unable","RNA pseudoknot","secondary structure dependent","biosynthesis of Q base","hypomodification of tRNAAsn","role","single modification site","simultaneous slippage","pseudoknot-independent","efficiency similar","little effect","single tRNA","eukaryotic translation systems","ribosome-bound tRNAs","elements","XXXYYYN","UUUAAAG","mnm5 substitution","XXXY YYN","amino group","trmE","trmC2","cmnm5s2UUU","marked influence","trmC1","small reduction","situation","place","available mutants","asuE","modifications","QUU","reticulocyte lysates","important qualitative differences","mnm5UUU","conclusions","data","fold","positions"],"language":"en"},

At this point, crystal structures are available for the viral proteases NSP1\u03B1, NSP1\u03B2 and NSP4 and the nucleocapsid protein, N. The NSP1\u03B1 and NSP1\u03B2 structures have revealed additional non-protease domains that may be involved in modulation of host functions. The N protein forms a dimer with a novel fold so far only seen in PRRSV and other nidoviruses. Cryo-electron tomographic studies have shown the three-dimensional organization of the PRRSV virion and suggest that the viral nucleocapsid has an asymmetric, linear arrangement, rather than the isometric core previously described.

Some countries are seeing a tailing down of cases, while others are still having persistent and sustained community spread. These evolving disease patterns call for a customized and dynamic approach to the selection, screening, planning, and for the conduct of surgery for these patients. METHODS: The current literature and various international society guidelines were reviewed and a set of recommendations were drafted. These were circulated to the Governors of the Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgeons of Asia (ELSA) for expert comments and discussion. The results of these were compiled and are presented in this paper. RESULTS: The recommendations include guidance for selection and screening of patients in times of active community spread, limited community spread, during times of sporadic cases or recovery and the transition between phases. Personal protective equipment requirements are also reviewed for each phase as minimum requirements. Capability management for the re-opening of services is also discussed. The choice between open and laparoscopic surgery is patient based, and the relative advantages of laparoscopic surgery with regard to complications, and respiratory recovery after major surgery has to be weighed against the lack of safety data for laparoscopic surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. We provide recommendations on the operating room set up and conduct of general surgery. If laparoscopic surgery is to be performed, we describe circuit modifications to assist in reducing plume generation and aerosolization. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic requires every surgical unit to have clear guidelines to ensure both patient and staff safety. These guidelines may assist in providing guidance to units developing their own protocols. A judicious approach must be adopted as surgical units look to re-open services as the pandemic evolves.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shabbir, Asim; Menon, Raj K.; Somani, Jyoti; So, Jimmy B.

So, some persons are willing to vaccinate, but other persons are willing to take risks. In this paper, we establish two different risk assessment systems using the technique of dynamic programming, and then compare the effects of the two different systems on the prevention of diseases on complex networks. One is that the perceived probability of being infected for each individual is the same (uniform case). The other is that the perceived probability of being infected is positively correlated to individual degrees (preferential case).

However, it is unclear which viral gene causes these effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein on PK-15 cells. We found that TGEV N protein suppressed cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases and apoptosis. Characterization of various cellular proteins that are involved in regulating cell cycle progression demonstrated that the expression of N gene resulted in an accumulation of p53 and p21, which suppressed cyclin B1, cdc2 and cdk2 expression. Moreover, the expression of TGEV N gene promoted translocation of Bax to mitochondria, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c, followed by activation of caspase-3, resulting in cell apoptosis in the transfected PK-15 cells following cell cycle arrest. Further studies showed that p53 inhibitor attenuated TGEV N protein induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases and apoptosis through reversing the expression changes of cdc2, cdk2 and cyclin B1 and the translocation changes of Bax and cytochrome c induced by TGEV N protein. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TGEV N protein might play an important role in TGEV infection-induced p53 activation and cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases and apoptosis occurrence.","publish_time":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Li; Huang, Yong; Du, Qian; Dong, Feng; Zhao, Xiaomin; Zhang, Wenlong; Xu, Xingang; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecb9a19c4b8cb6167cdddffa5db9aa210e9165ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092941.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.02.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548406/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X14002915; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X14002915","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","TGEV N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell apoptosis","expression of TGEV N gene","TGEV N protein suppressed cell proliferation","cell cycle progression","p53 inhibitor attenuated TGEV N protein induced cell cycle arrest","expression of N gene","TGEV infection-induced p53 activation","effects of TGEV nucleocapsid","activation of p53","G2","cdk2 expression","phases","apoptosis occurrence","expression changes of cdc2","accumulation of p53","translocation of Bax","translocation changes of Bax","cyclin B1","activation of caspase","viral gene","release of cytochrome c","cultured host cells","transfected PK","previous studies","important role","turn","mitochondria","p21","Characterization of various cellular proteins","results","study"],"language":"en"},

In these latter hosts, the ORF3 gene systematically displays one or two identical deletions leading to the synthesis of truncated proteins gp3-\u03941 and gp3-\u03942. As deletions in CoV accessory proteins have already been involved in tissue or host switch, studies of these different gp3 proteins were conducted in canine and feline cell. All proteins oligomerise through covalent bonds, are N-glycosylated and are maintained in the ER in non-infected but also in CCoV-II infected cells, without any specific retention signal. However, deletions influence their level of expression. In canine cells, all proteins are expressed with similar level whereas in feline cells, the expression of gp3-\u03941 is higher than the two other forms of gp3. None of the gp3 proteins modulate the viral replication cycle of heterologous genotype II CCoV in canine cell line, leading to the conclusion that the gp3 proteins are probably advantageous only for CCoV-I and atypical FCoV strains.","publish_time":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pham-Hung d\u2019Alexandry d\u2019Orengiani, Anne-Laure; Duarte, Lidia; Pavio, Nicole; Le Poder, Sophie","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c39831e4fb50476f1d02c29f62deb4756133de0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114440.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25665789/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215000520; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.01.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215000520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different gp3 proteins","expression of gp3","gp3-\u03942","forms of gp3","CCoV","proteins oligomerise","synthesis of truncated proteins gp3-\u03941","canine cells","CoV accessory proteins","feline cells","accessory glycoprotein gp3 of unknown function","canine strain","infected cells","canine cell line","atypical feline FCoV strains","level of expression","atypical FCoV strains","identical deletions","Abstract ORF3","ORF3 gene","similar level","viral replication cycle of heterologous genotype","supplemental open reading frame coding","studies","host switch","covalent bonds","tissue","conclusion","specific retention signal","hosts"],"language":"en"},

Extensive use of antibiotics by livestock producers promotes the spread of new resistant strains, some of zoonotic concern, which increases food-borne illness in humans and causes significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Furthermore, consumer preferences for meat/poultry/fish produced without the use of antibiotics shape today\u2019s market demand. So, it is viewed as inevitable by the One Health Initiative that humans need to reduce the use of antibiotics and turn to alternative, improved means to control disease: vaccination and prophylactics. Besides the intense research focused on novel therapeutic molecules, both these strategies rely heavily on the availability of cost-effective, efficient and scalable production platforms which will allow large-volume manufacturing for vaccines, antibodies and other biopharmaceuticals. Within this context, plant-based platforms for production of recombinant therapeutic proteins offer significant advantages over conventional expression systems, including lack of animal pathogens, low production costs, fast turnaround and response times and rapid, nearly-unlimited scalability. Also, because dried leaves and seeds can be stored at room temperature for lengthy periods without loss of recombinant proteins, plant expression systems have the potential to offer lucrative benefits from the development of edible vaccines and prophylactics, as these would not require \u201Ccold chain\u201D storage and transportation, and could be administered in mass volumes with minimal processing. Several biotechnology companies currently have developed and adopted plant-based platforms for commercial production of recombinant protein therapeutics. In this manuscript, we outline the challenges in the process of livestock immunization as well as the current plant biotechnology developments aimed to address these challenges.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolotilin, Igor; Topp, Ed; Cox, Eric; Devriendt, Bert; Conrad, Udo; Joensuu, Jussi; St\u00F6ger, Eva; Warzecha, Heribert; McAllister, Tim; Potter, Andrew; McLean, Michael D; Hall, J Christopher; Menassa, Rima","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8915fde10e62d4b033a9141910e5639590f0bae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4280687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559098/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-014-0117-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plant expression systems","plant-based platforms","production of recombinant therapeutic proteins","scalable production platforms","Extensive use of antibiotics","loss of recombinant proteins","low production costs","commercial production of recombinant protein therapeutics","conventional expression systems","healthcare systems","current plant biotechnology developments","humans","challenges","prophylactics","use of antibiotics shape today\u2019s market demand","significant advantages","livestock producers","Health Initiative","biotechnology companies","lack of animal pathogens","significant economic burden","novel therapeutic molecules","development of edible vaccines","process of livestock immunization","World Health Organization","fast turnaround","response times","lengthy periods","spread of new resistant strains","room temperature","infectious diseases","emergence of antibiotic resistance","lucrative benefits","poultry","large-volume manufacturing","fish","alternative","potential","zoonotic concern","improved means","availability of cost-effective","seeds","meat","alarming increase","antibodies","vaccination","food","strategies","intense research","illness","consumer preferences","serious threat","cold chain","storage","transportation","mass volumes","minimal processing","context","unlimited scalability","dried leaves","biopharmaceuticals","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

Planners automatically assume that emergency health care workers will respond. However, we need to ask: Should they, and will they, work rather than flee? The answer involves basic moral and personal issues. This article identifies and examines the factors that influence health care workers\u2019 decisions in these situations. After reviewing physicians\u2019 response to past disasters and epidemics, we evaluate how much danger they actually faced. Next, we examine guidelines from medical professional organizations about physicians\u2019 duty to provide care despite personal risks, although we acknowledge that individuals will interpret and apply professional expectations and norms according to their own situation and values. The article goes on to articulate moral arguments for a duty to treat during disasters and social crises, as well as moral reasons that may limit or override such a duty. How fear influences behavior is examined, as are the institutional and social measures that can be taken to control fear and to encourage health professionals to provide treatment in crisis situations. Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of effective risk communication in enabling health care professionals and the public to make informed and defensible decisions during disasters. We conclude that the decision to stay or leave will ultimately depend on individuals\u2019 risk assessment and their value systems. Preparations for the next pandemic or disaster should include policies that encourage emergency physicians, who are inevitably among those at highest risk, to \u201Cstay and fight.\u201D","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iserson, Kenneth V.; Heine, Carlton E.; Larkin, Gregory Luke; Moskop, John C.; Baruch, Jay; Aswegan, Andrew L.","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/333cbdcd64f39287a3e3d98cd9497c05f559c4f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124291.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064407014357; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064407014357","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care professionals","emergency health care workers","health care system\u2019s","health professionals","health care workers\u2019 decisions","emergency physicians","article","physicians\u2019 duty","highest risk","individuals\u2019 risk assessment","personal issues","personal risks","social crises","past disasters","moral arguments","moral reasons","importance of effective risk communication","emergency department support staff","physicians\u2019 response","defensible decisions","professional expectations","crisis situations","social measures","medical professional organizations","fear influences behavior","nurses","public","epidemics","factors","value systems","guidelines","answer","policies","treatment","hospital personnel","norms","pandemic","leave","Planners","Preparations","families","values","danger","fight"],"language":"en"},

Methods An observational study was performed in 11 hospitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program between January 7 and March 30, 2011. Using a standardized data collection tool, observers recorded HCWs selecting and removing PPE and performing hand hygiene on entry into the rooms of febrile respiratory illness patients. Results The majority of HCWs put on gloves (88%, n = 390), gown (83%, n = 368), and mask (88%, n = 386). Only 37% (n = 163) were observed to have put on eye protection. Working in a pediatric unit was significantly associated with not wearing eye protection (7%), gown (70%), gloves (77%), or mask (79%). Half of the observed HCWs (54%, n = 206) removed their PPE in the correct sequence. Twenty-six percent performed hand hygiene after removing their gloves, 46% after removing their gown, and 57% after removing their mask and/or eye protection. Conclusion Overall adherence with appropriate PPE use in health care settings involving febrile respiratory illness patients was modest, particularly on pediatric units. Interventions to improve PPE use should be targeted toward the use of recommended precautions (eg, eye protection), HCWs working in pediatric units, the correct sequence of PPE removal, and performing hand hygiene.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Robyn; Roth, Virginia; Gravel, Denise; Astrakianakis, George; Bryce, Elizabeth; Forgie, Sarah; Johnston, Lynn; Taylor, Geoffrey; Vearncombe, Mary","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09e29610427ec5c1d3dd8fab6571c8168087f190.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23073484/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655312008140; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2012.04.332; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655312008140","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eye protection","appropriate PPE use","observed HCWs","majority of HCWs","hand hygiene","gloves","gown","mask","correct sequence of PPE removal","pediatric units","use of recommended precautions","rooms of febrile respiratory illness patients","health care settings","health care workers","proper use of personal protective equipment","spread of infection","Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program","observers","entry","Conclusion Overall adherence","hospitals","standardized data collection tool","implications","observational study","HCW safety","Methods","percent","Half","Interventions"],"language":"en"},

Positively charged PMOs (PMOplus\u2122) are effective for the postexposure protection of two fulminant viral diseases, Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever in nonhuman primates, and this class of antisense agent may also have possibilities for treatment of other viral diseases. PMOs are highly stable, are effective by a variety of routes of administration, can be readily formulated in common isotonic delivery vehicles, and can be rapidly designed and synthesized. These are properties which may make PMOs good candidates for use during responses to emerging or reemerging viruses that may be insensitive to available therapies or for use during outbreaks, especially in regions that lack a modern medical infrastructure. While the efficacy of sequence-specific therapies can be limited by target-site sequence variations that occur between variants or by the emergence of resistant mutants during infections, various PMO design strategies can minimize these impacts. These strategies include the use of promiscuous bases such as inosine to compensate for predicted base-pair mismatches, the use of sequences that target conserved sites between viral strains, and the use of sequences that target host products that viruses utilize for infection.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warren, Travis K.; Shurtleff, Amy C.; Bavari, Sina","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23427874b3cbf78a67ca6a7dc63d02c2bf1240c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114334.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22353544/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421200037X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421200037X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.02.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of sequences","use of promiscuous bases","fulminant viral diseases","viral strains","specific RNA sequences","PMOs good candidates","specific therapies","target-site sequence variations","base-pair duplexes","predicted base-pair mismatches","available therapies","reemerging viruses","efficacy of sequence","class of antisense agent","various PMO design strategies","synthetic antisense oligonucleotide analogs","infections","Marburg hemorrhagic fever","Ebola","nonhuman primates","responses","emergence of resistant mutants","variants","regions","inosine","possibilities","postexposure protection","host products","conserved sites","Abstract Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers","treatment","outbreaks","variety of routes","translational processes","common isotonic delivery vehicles","modern medical infrastructure","impacts","properties","administration","PMOplus"],"language":"en"},

Mutant selection may jeopardize control of the viral disease. Strategies intended to minimize vaccination and treatment failures are proposed and justified based on fundamental features of viral dynamics explained in the preceding chapters. The recommended use of complex, multiepitopic vaccines, and combination therapies as early as possible after initiation of infection falls under the general concept that complexity cannot be combated with simplicity. It also follows that sociopolitical action to interrupt virus replication and spread as soon as possible is as important as scientifically sound treatment designs to control viral disease on a global scale.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virus as Populations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07ceca318dbbdee22104dd4460a9cac3c29d0685.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153035.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128163313000088; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128163313000088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral disease","selection of viral mutants","genetic composition of viral populations","fundamental features of viral dynamics","RNA viruses","control","adaptive potential of viruses","multiepitopic vaccines","general concept","genomic composition","treatment failures","Mutant selection","sound treatment designs","inhibitors","combination therapies","infected host","degree of resistance","evolutionary forces","recommended use of complex","initiation of infection","virus replication","sociopolitical action","vaccination","complexity","tangible challenge","progress","Abstract Medical interventions","preceding chapters","global scale","epidemiological level","Strategies","simplicity"],"language":"en"},

This work presents a novel mathematical modeling framework that integrates both outbreak dynamics and outbreak control into a decision support tool for mitigating infectious disease pandemics that spread through passenger air travel. An ensemble of border control strategies that exploit properties of the air traffic network structure and expected outbreak behavior are proposed. A stochastic metapopulation epidemic model is developed to evaluate and rank the control strategies based on their effectiveness in reducing the spread of outbreaks. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to illustrate the robustness of the proposed control strategies across a range of outbreak scenarios, and a case study is presented for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

The continuum limit of this model is a system of Delay Differential Equations, the analysis of which reveals clearly the dependence of epidemic evolution on model parameters including disease reproductive number, isolation probability, speed of identification of infected hosts and recovery rates.

METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty Chinese children and adolescents (8 to 16 years) underwent graded cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill until volitional exhaustion. Peak VO(2) was corrected for the effects of body mass by ratio or allometric scaling. Z score equations for predicting peak VO(2) were developed. Correlations between scaled peak VO(2), z scores, body size and age were tested to examine the effectiveness of the approach. RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-two participants (48% male) were included in the analyses. Absolute peak VO(2) significantly increased with age in both sexes (both P\u003C0.05), while ratio-scaled peak VO(2) increased only in males (P\u003C0.05). Allometrically scaled peak VO(2) increased from 11 years in both sexes, plateauing by 12 years in girls and continuing to rise until 15 years in boys. Allometically scaled peak VO(2) was not correlated with body mass, but remained correlated with height and age in all but the older girls. Peak VO(2) z score was not correlated with body mass, height or age. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute and allometric scaled peak VO(2) values are provided for Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents by age and sex. Peak VO(2) z scores improve the evaluation of cardiopulmonary fitness, allowing comparisons across ages and sex and will likely provide a better metric for tracking change over time in children and adolescents, regardless of body size and age.","publish_time":"2019-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Clare C.

Hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target in the therapeutic treatment and diagnostic detection of the influenza virus. Influenza A virus encompasses several different HA subtypes with different strains, which are constantly changing. In this study, we identified a fully human H1N1 neutralizing antibody (32D6) via an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell-based technology. 32D6 specifically neutralizes the clinically isolated H1N1 strains after the 2009 pandemic but not the earlier strains. The epitope was identified through X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 complex structure, which revealed a unique loop conformation located on the top surface of HA. The major region is composed of two peptide segments (residues 172\u2013177 and 206\u2013213), which form an abreast loop conformation. The residue T262 between the two loops forms a conformational epitope for recognition by 32D6. Three water molecules were observed at the interface of HA and the heavy chain, and they may constitute a stabilizing element for the 32D6-HA association. In addition, each 32D6-Fab is likely capable of blocking one HA trimer. This study provides important information on the strain specificity of 32D6 for the therapeutic treatment and detection of viral infection.","publish_time":"2019-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Cheng-Chung; Yang, Chih-Ya; Lin, Li-Ling; Ko, Tzu-Ping; Chang, Alarng Hsun-Lang; Chang, Stanley Shi-Chung; Wang, Andrew H.-J.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf533451f25297fe0d1a6006fc562568358cefb6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6418199.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6418199/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hemagglutinin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["32D6-HA association","32D6-Fab","interface of HA","HA trimer","surface of HA","influenza virus infection","strain specificity of 32D6","different HA subtypes","different strains","therapeutic treatment","isolated H1N1 strains","earlier strains","study","detection of viral infection","unique loop conformation","abreast loop conformation","diagnostic detection","important information","important target","conformational epitope","human H1N1","Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell-based technology","likely capable of blocking","contagious acute respiratory disease","loops","HA1 complex structure","pandemic","X-ray crystallographic analysis","recognition","antibody","peptide segments","stabilizing element","heavy chain","major region","residues","residue T262","water molecules","Hemagglutinin","addition"],"language":"en"},

In the clinical setting with limited resources, high degree of suspicion is needed to diagnose cardiac involvement including myocarditis. Although myocarditis is not reported as a common complication due to lack of diagnostic facilities, there are evidence to support myocarditis is more prevalent in post mortem studies of patients died due to leptospirosis. We present a case series of severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement observed during a period of one month at Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here five patients with severe leptospirosis complicated with cardiac involvement, admitted to a single medical ward, Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka during a one-month period. Out of six suspected leptospirosis patients admitted during that period, five in a raw developed severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement. In this case series, four patients were confirmed serologically or quantitative PCR and one patient had possible leptospirosis. All patients developed shock during their course of illness. Two patients developed rapid atrial fibrillation. One patient had dynamic T wave changes in ECG and the other two had sinus tachycardia. Two patients had evidence of myocarditis in 2D echocardiogram, whereas other two patients had nonspecific findings and one patient had normal 2D echocardiogram. All five patients had elevated cardiac troponin I titre and it was normalized with the recovery. All five patients developed acute kidney injury. Four patients needed inotropic/vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure and one patient recovered from shock with fluid resuscitation. All patients were recovered from their illness and repeat 2D echocardiograms after recovery did not show residual complications. One patient had serologically proven dengue co-infection with leptospirosis. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis and cardiac involvement in leptospirosis may be overlooked due to non-specific clinical findings and co-existing multi-organ dysfunction. Atypical presentation of this case series may be due to micro-geographic variation and unusual outbreak of leptospirosis. Co-infection of dengue with leptospirosis should be considered in managing patients especially in endemic areas.","publish_time":"2019-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jayathilaka, P. G. N. S.; Mendis, A.

Although typical ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, ZIKV infection during pregnancy is increasingly associated with microcephaly and other fetal developmental abnormalities. In the last few years, genomic and molecular investigations have established a remarkable progress on the pathogenic mechanisms of ZIKV infection using in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we highlight recent advances in ZIKV-host cell interaction studies, including cellular targets of ZIKV, ZIKV-mediated cell death mechanisms, host cell restriction factors that limit ZIKV replication, and immune evasion mechanisms utilized by ZIKV.

We used latent class growth analysis to identify school academic recovery trajectories for a cohort of 462 Texas public schools that were in the path of Hurricane Ike in 2008. Using Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) data from 2005 to 2011, we found that attendance and percent of economically disadvantaged youth emerged as significant risk factors for two identified academic recovery trajectories (High\u2010Stable and Low\u2010Interrupted). Higher levels of economically disadvantaged youth were associated with lower likelihood of falling in the High\u2010Stable trajectory, relative to the Low\u2010Interrupted trajectory. Higher levels of attendance were associated with higher likelihood of membership in the High\u2010Stable trajectory, relative to the Low\u2010Interrupted trajectory. These findings are consistent with the notion that disasters do not affect all people or communities equally.

We test whether a species genetic diversity is higher when it has congeners in the community with which it can exchange genes and if shared haplotypes are more frequent in genetically diverse species, as expected in the presence of introgression. We sampled a total of 1,681 individual trees from 472 species corresponding to 198 genera and sequenced them at a noncoding chloroplast DNA fragment. Polymorphism was more frequent in species that have congeneric species in the study site than in those without congeners (30% vs. 12%). Moreover, more chloroplast haplotypes were shared with congeners in polymorphic species than in monomorphic ones (44% vs. 28%). Despite large heterogeneities caused by genus\u2010specific behaviors in patterns of hybridization, these results suggest that the higher polymorphism in the presence of congeners is caused by local introgression rather than by incomplete lineage sorting. Our findings suggest that introgression has the potential to drive intraspecific genetic diversity in species\u2010rich tropical forests.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caron, Henri; Molino, Jean\u2010Fran\u00E7ois; Sabatier, Daniel; L\u00E9ger, Patrick; Chaumeil, Philippe; Scotti\u2010Saintagne, Caroline; Frig\u00E9rio, Jean\u2010Marc; Scotti, Ivan; Franc, Alain; Petit, R\u00E9my J.","journal":"Ecol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed178f9c8d2bf5490cc4af97da39b931a8952a7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6476754.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476754/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polymorphic species","congeneric species","diverse species","species genetic diversity","presence of congeners","chloroplast haplotypes","presence of introgression","chloroplast DNA variation","patterns of intraspecific","intraspecific genetic diversity","local introgression","higher polymorphism","shared haplotypes","noncoding chloroplast DNA fragment","hyperdiverse community of tropical rainforest trees","patterns of hybridization","individual trees","interspecific variation","rich tropical forests","French Guiana","specific behaviors","genus","potential","results","study site","incomplete lineage sorting","large heterogeneities","monomorphic ones","genes","total","findings","genera"],"language":"en"},

We have demonstrated that loss-of-function of the three components of eIF4F, including eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G, remarkably promotes the levels of rotavirus genomic RNA and viral protein VP4. Consistently, knockdown of the negative regulator of eIF4F and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) inhibits the expression of viral mRNA and the VP4 protein. Mechanically, we confirmed that the silence of the eIF4F complex suppressed the protein level of IRF1 and IRF7 that exert potent antiviral effects against rotavirus infection. Thus, these results demonstrate that the eIF4F complex is an essential host factor restricting rotavirus replication, revealing new targets for the development of new antiviral strategies against rotavirus infection.","publish_time":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Sunrui; Feng, Cui; Fang, Yan; Zhou, Xinying; Xu, Lei; Wang, Wenshi; Kong, Xiangdong; P.

DESIGN: A prospective, qualitative exploratory study that employed online questionnaires and open-ended, semi-structured interviews with two participant groups: (1) global health physicians and (2) global health programme leaders affiliated with USA-based academic medical centres. Open coding procedures and thematic content analysis were used to analyse data and derive themes for discussion. PARTICIPANTS: 159 global health physicians and global health programme leaders at 25 academic medical institutions were invited via email to take a survey and participate in a follow-up interview. Twelve participants completed online questionnaires (7.5% response rate) and eight participants (four survey participants and four additionally recruited participants) participated in in-depth, in-person or phone semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Five themes emerged that highlight how global health physicians and academic global health programme leaders perceive global health work abroad in shaping USA-based medical practices: (1) a sense of improved patient rapport, particularly with low-income, refugee and immigrant patients, and improved and more engaged patient care; (2) reduced spending on healthcare services; (3) greater awareness of the social determinants of health; (4) deeper understanding of the USA\u2019s healthcare system compared with systems in other countries; and (5) a reinforcement of values that initially motivated physicians to pursue work in global health. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of participating global health physicians and programme leaders believed that international engagements improved patient care back in the USA. Participant responses relating to the five themes were contextualised by highlighting factors that simultaneously impinge on their ability to provide improved patient care, such as the social determinants of health, and the challenges of changing USA healthcare policy.","publish_time":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matthews-Trigg, Nathaniel; Citrin, David; Halliday, Scott; Acharya, Bibhav; Maru, Sheela; Bezruchka, Stephen; Maru, Duncan","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7ec0563ddbb18f183ddbd147056d8a2aca9fef2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ad8c7c22faa32a928133bfeb767353400262040c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6500299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6500299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health work","academic global health programme leaders","majority of participating global health physicians","social determinants of health","based physicians","improved patient care","motivated physicians","survey participants","healthcare practices","themes","academic medical institutions","academic medical centres","engaged patient care","healthcare services","medical practices","sense of improved patient rapport","challenges of changing USA healthcare policy","online questionnaires","USA\u2019s healthcare system","phone semi-structured interviews","participant groups","reinforcement of values","Participant responses","qualitative exploratory study","thematic content analysis","viewpoints","international engagements","Open coding procedures","person","greater awareness","deeper understanding","perspectives of US","refugee","data","systems","response rate","email","ability","immigrant patients","DESIGN","CONCLUSIONS","spending","countries","follow-up interview","discussion","factors","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, IFN-I is associated with CD4 T cell depletion and attenuation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Therefore, therapeutic manipulation of IFN-I signaling to improve HIV disease outcome is a source of much interest and debate in the field.

The nasopharyngeal region could be a potent carrier of long-term bioaerosol exposure agents. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of swine workers and the swine barns bioaerosol biodiversity. Methods: Air samples from eight swine barns as well as nasopharyngeal swabs from pig workers (n = 25) and from a non-exposed control group (n = 29) were sequenced using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Wastewater treatment plants were used as the industrial, low-dust, non-agricultural environment control to validate the microbial link between the bioaerosol content (air) and the nasopharynxes of workers. Results: A multivariate analysis showed air samples and nasopharyngeal flora of pig workers cluster together, compared to the non-exposed control group. The significance was confirmed with the PERMANOVA statistical test (p-value of 0.0001). Unlike the farm environment, nasopharynx samples from wastewater workers did not cluster with air samples from wastewater treatment plants. The difference in the microbial community of nasopharynx of swine workers and a control group suggest that swine workers are carriers of germs found in bioaerosols.

However, there are great challenges to investigate telocytes functions using primary telocytes, due to the difficulties of isolation, identification, and stability. The present study aims at constructing continuous cell strain of mouse lung telocyte cell line with stable characters by gene modification and investigating biological behaviors and responses of gene-modified telocytes to inflammation. METHODS: Mouse primary lung telocytes were isolated and identified using immune-labeling markers and immunoelectron microscopy. Primary telocytes were transformed with Simian vacuolating virus 40 small and large T antigen (SV40). Biological characters, behaviors morphology, and proliferation of those gene-modified telocytes were defined and monitored dynamically for 50 generations, as compared with primary lung telocytes. Cell cycle of mouse primary lung telocytes or gene-modified telocytes was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Gene modified telocytes of generations 5, 10, 30 and 50 were observed with telopodes and also showed CD34 and ckit positive. Multiple cellular morphology were also observed on telocyte cell-line under monitor of celliq and enhanced cell proliferation were showed. SV40 transduction was also reduced apoptosis and increased the ratio of S and G2 phases in telocyte cell-line. CONCLUSION: We successfully constructed mouse lung telocyte cell-line which maintained the biological properties and behaviors as primary telocytes and could responses to inflammation induced by LPS. Thus, gene-modified lung telocytes, Telocyte Line, would provide a cell tool for researchers exploring the roles and applications of telocytes involved in physiological and pathological states in future.

A major limitation that has hindered the use of Treg immunotherapy in humans is the difficulty of consistently isolating and obtaining highly purified Tregs after ex vivo expansion. Methods: We isolated bona fide Tregs from expansion cultures based on their selective surface expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP). The TCR V\u03B2 diversity and intracellular cytokine production of Tregs were determined by flow cytometer. The TSDR methylation was determined by epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay. Their in vitro and in vivo potency was confirmed with suppression assay and humanized xenogeneic GVHD (xGVHD) murine model, respectively. Results: LAP(\u002B) repurification results in \u003E90% LAP(\u002B)FOXP3(\u002B) Tregs, leaving behind FOXP3(-) and FOXP3(\u002B) nonTregs within the LAP(-) population.

In the xGVHD model, exogenous CD25(-)PBMC administered alone results in a median survival of 32 days. The co-transfer of LAP(\u002B) Tregs increased median survival to 47 days, while the LAP parent (CD25(\u002B)) and LAP(-) nonTregs had median survival of 39 and 31 days, respectively. Conclusions: These preclinical data together provide evidence that LAP(\u002B) Tregs are highly purified with fully suppressive function for cell therapy. This population results in a more effective and safer product for immunotherapy to treat GVHD and provides the necessary preclinical data for transition into a clinical trial with LAP(\u002B) Tregs to prevent or treat GVHD and other autoimmune diseases.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Huihui; Song, Hyo; Pham, Anha V.; Cooper, Laurence J.; Schulze, Janika J.; Olek, Sven; Tran, Dat Q.","journal":"Theranostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13b16688b86661a6165f9c688c4f45893b7e47c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6531299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TSDR","GVHD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAP parent","purified Tregs","co-transfer of LAP","intracellular cytokine production of Tregs","median survival","days","population results","repurification results","humanized xenogeneic GVHD","TCR V\u03B2 diversity","epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay","xGVHD model","expansion cultures","autoimmune diseases","week expansion","nonTregs","necessary preclinical data","suppression assay","murine model","exogenous CD25","cell therapy","TSDR methylation","suppressive function","host diseases","Adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells","use of Treg immunotherapy","potential curative immune therapy","selective surface expression of latency","transition","associated peptide","clinical trial","safer product","humans","PBMC","evidence","difficulty","graft","flow cytometer","major limitation","potency","anergic","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

It still remains a main public health concern at global level and in Arab world mainly in low-income countries. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the Arab world\u2019s growing contribution to global leishmaniasis research. METHODS: This study describes a bibliometric review of all leishmaniasis research publications published between January 1998 and December 2017 indexed on the Scopus database. RESULTS: The total number of publications published at global level was 17,570 papers, which achieves an average annual productivity of 878.50 papers publications. Brazil was responsible for the greatest output with the total number of publications of 3865 followed by the Unites States (n = 2729), India (n = 2119), the United Kingdom (n = 1363), and Spain (n = 1274). By limiting the analysis to the publications that have been published by Arab world, the research productivity was 993 papers, which represents 5.65% of total research output at global level in research regarding leishmaniasis. Tunisia was responsible for the greatest output from Arab world with the total number of publications of 297 followed by Sudan (n = 192), Saudi Arabia (n = 131), Morocco (n = 119) and Egypt (n = 67). Since 1998, the growth of publications on leishmaniasis fluctuates, overall showing a rising trend in both global and Arab world. There is a highly significant correlation between publication productivity related to leishmaniasis at global level and the Arab world (r = 0.936; p-value\u003C 0.001). Leishmaniasis treatment, intracellular mechanism of infection, and lifecycle of leishmania are the major current hot topics for the research in this subject at global level and the Arab world. CONCLUSIONS: The current study presents a novel review of the current Arab leishmaniasis-related research, and how these results are related to worldwide output. In comparison to the global research output, the Arab world produced less leishmaniasis research. The data presented in the current study by this innovative approach may serve relevant researchers to direct the global leishmaniasis research to Arab counties in which leishmaniasis is endemic.","publish_time":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Jabi, Samah W.","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43e0f5f9add9380a45d39f55aab2ca96d589280c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532175.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6532175/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","India","United Kingdom","Tunisia"],"keyphrases":["global leishmaniasis research","leishmaniasis research publications","global research output","current Arab leishmaniasis-related research","global level","research productivity","total research output","Leishmaniasis treatment","Arab counties","papers publications","total number of publications","current study","growth of publications","greatest output","Arab world\u2019s growing contribution","worldwide output","publication productivity","RESULTS","major current hot topics","average annual productivity","bibliometric review","novel review","lifecycle of leishmania","Leishmania genus","parasitic disease","neglected tropical disease","intracellular mechanism of infection","relevant researchers","main public health concern","innovative approach","subject","protozoan","rising trend","significant correlation","BACKGROUND","Brazil","Tunisia","Saudi Arabia","low-income countries","comparison","p-value","United Kingdom","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Sudan","India","Spain","Morocco","Egypt","Scopus database","analysis","States"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the stimulatory effect of emodin on BSEP signaling pathway in cholestasis. METHODS: Cell and animal experiments were given different concentrations of emodin. The BSEP upstream molecule farnesoid X receptor was down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology or guggulsterones and up-regulated by lentivirus or GW4064. Real-time PCR and Western blotting was employed to detect the mRNA and protein levels of BSEP in LO2 cell, rat primary hepatocytes and liver tissue. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the expression of BSEP in liver tissues. Rat liver function and pathological changes of liver tissue were performed by biochemical test and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. RESULTS: Emodin could increase the mRNA and protein expression of BSEP and FXR. When down-regulating farnesoid X receptor expression with the siRNA or inhibitor guggulsterones, and up-regulating farnesoid X receptor expression with the lentivirus or agonist GW4064, emodin could increase the mRNA level of BSEP and FXR and the protein level of BSEP, FXR1, and FXR2. Emodin also had a notable effect on rat primary hepatocytes experiment, rat pathological manifestation, BSEP, FXR1, and FXR2 positive staining in liver tissues and the test of liver function.

Following Lakoff\u2019s work on emerging infectious diseases, the paper illustrates that while an \u2018actuarial\u2019 approach to AMR may be challenging to stabilise due to definitional and logistical issues, it has been successfully stabilised through a \u2018sentinel\u2019 approach that emphasises the threat of AMR. Second, the paper draws out a contrast between the way AMR is formulated in terms of a problem of connectedness\u2014a \u2018One Health\u2019 issue\u2014and the frequent solutions to AMR being focused on individual behaviour. The paper suggests that AMR presents an opportunity to take seriously connections, scale and systems but that this effort is undermined by the prevailing tendency to reduce health issues to matters for individual responsibility. Third, the paper takes AMR as a moment of infrastructural inversion (Bowker and Star) when antimicrobials and the work they do are rendered more visible. This leads to the proposal of antibiotics as infrastructure\u2014part of the woodwork that we take for granted, and entangled with our ways of doing life, in particular modern life. These explorations render visible the ways social, economic and political frames continue to define AMR and how it may be acted upon, which opens up possibilities for reconfiguring AMR research and action.","publish_time":"2019-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandler, Clare I.

Little is known about norovirus infections in most non-human hosts, but the close genetic relatedness between some animal and human noroviruses coupled with lack of understanding where newly appearing human norovirus genotypes and variants are emerging from has led to the hypothesis that norovirus may not be host restricted and might be able to jump the species barrier.

In parallel, binding of PRC1/2 to target genes is strongly reduced, coinciding with a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 marks. Nucleolar-accumulated CBX proteins are immobile, but remarkably both CBX protein accumulation and loss of PRC1/2 epigenetic marks are reversible.

Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the non-structural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.","publish_time":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russo, Alice G; Kelly, Andrew G; Enosi Tuipulotu, Daniel; Tanaka, Mark M; White, Peter A","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfb3f090f09ba13429edc88b5f1d8a595df81fc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6580184.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6580184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["scapularis NIRVS","novel NIRVS","NIRVS landscape","characterised NIRVS","NIRVS phylogeny","NIRVS formation","Ixodes scapularis","viral cDNA","viral titre","relevant arthropods","scapularis ISE6 cell line","non-LTR","Aedes mosquitoes","incoming viral transcripts","remnants of past germline RNA viral infections","Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences","untapped wealth of viral diversity","Small RNA","LTR retrotransposons","ticks","possible antiviral mechanism","alternative arbovirus vectors","genomic piRNA clusters","efficient arbovirus vector","Rhipicephalus microplus","main antiviral defence mechanism","silencing pathways","genomic proximity","blacklegged tick","important vector","virus groups","dominant host","host genome","hard tick","emerging arboviruses","fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat","traditional mosquito vectors","primary piRNA production","Ixodes-specific adaptation","transmission of pathogenic arboviruses","Culicoides sonorensis","Anopheles gambiae","Phlebotomus papatasi","Culex quinquefasciatus","replicase","Future studies","integration patterns","organism","negative-sense viruses","template","PIWI","midges","bunya","potential source of sRNAs","structural regions","non-structural region","sand flies","Drosophila melanogaster","studeis","study","unexpected abundance","adaptive immunity","glycoprotein","piRNAs","orthomyxo","aegypti"],"language":"en"},

With other pathogens, they cause bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in ruminants. The aim of the study was the detection and molecular characterisation of BPIV3 and BRSV from nasal swabs and lung samples of cows in and around the Erzurum region of eastern Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 155 samples were collected. Of animals used in the study 92 were males and 63 females. The age of the animals was between 9 months and 5 years, mean 1.4 years. Most males were in the fattening period and being raised in open sheds; females were in the lactating period and kept in free stall barns. All samples were tested for the presence of viral genes using RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers in a molecular method (RT-PCR) identified BRSV (fusion gene) and BPIV3 (matrix gene) strains at the genus level. RESULTS: RNA from BRSV and BPIV3 was detected in two (1.29%) and three (1.93%) samples, respectively, one of each of which was sequenced and the sequences were aligned with reference virus strains. Phylogenetic analyses clustered the strains in genotype C/BPIV3 and subgroup III/BRSV. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that BRSV and BPIV3 contribute to bovine respiratory disease cases in Turkey. This is the first report on their detection and molecular characterisation in ruminants in Turkey.","publish_time":"2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Timurkan, Mehmet Ozkan; Aydin, Hakan; Sait, Ahmet","journal":"J Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f245596ffe228f1eb183e60f02428bf156bea645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6598183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6598183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":["Turkey"],"keyphrases":["BRSV","molecular characterisation of BPIV3","bovine respiratory disease complex","bovine respiratory disease cases","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","cause of respiratory disease","Bovine parainfluenza virus","reference virus strains","molecular method","matrix gene","fusion gene","RT-PCR","detection","study","ruminants","lung samples of cows","females","RESULTS","animals","years","Gene-specific primers","lactating period","fattening period","Erzurum region of eastern Turkey","nasal swabs","genotype C","BRDC","open sheds","presence of viral genes","subgroup","free stall barns","Phylogenetic analyses","genus level","METHODS","total","sequences","INTRODUCTION","report","cattle","pathogens","RNA","MATERIAL","months","aim","CONCLUSION","age"],"language":"en"},

The vaccination with immunogenic PiCV recombinant capsid protein (PiCV rCP) is a potential tool for disease control. Because of the high prevalence of PiCV asymptomatic infections, the subclinically infected pigeons will be vaccinated in practice. The aim of this study was to answer a question if vaccination of asymptomatic, infected with PiCV pigeons induces a similar immune response to PiCV rCP as in uninfected birds. One hundred and twenty 6-week-old carrier pigeons were divided into 4 groups (2 groups of naturally infected and uninfected with PiCV individuals). Birds from groups V and V1 were vaccinated twice with PiCV rCP mixed with an adjuvant, whereas pigeons from groups C and C1 were immunized with an adjuvant only. The expression of genes encoding IFN-\u03B3, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocyte receptors; the number of anti-PiCV rCP IgY-secreting B cells (SBC) and anti-PiCV rCP IgY were evaluated 2, 21, 39 and 46 days post vaccination (dpv). Study results showed that the expression of CD8 and IFN-\u03B3 genes was higher in both groups of infected pigeons than in the uninfected birds, irrespective of vaccination. In the uninfected birds, the expression of these genes was insignificantly higher in the vaccinated pigeons. The anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC were detected on 2 and 23 dpv and seroconversion was noted on 23 and 39 dpv in V and V1 groups, respectively. In the light of the results obtained, it could be concluded that pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein elicits the immune response in both naturally infected and uninfected pigeons, but its rate varies depending on PiCV infectious status. The infection with PiCV masks the potential cellular immune response to the vaccination with PiCV rCP and leads to the suppression of humoral immunity.","publish_time":"2019-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stenzel, Tomasz; Dziewulska, Daria; \u015Amia\u0142ek, Marcin; Tyka\u0142owski, Bart\u0142omiej; Kowalczyk, Joanna; Koncicki, Andrzej","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e78cecafd32aeadea4fe12d0a7d3f7883d222b58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6599111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6599111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PiCV pigeons","PiCV individuals","number of anti-PiCV rCP","groups of infected pigeons","uninfected pigeons","PiCV infectious status","vaccinated pigeons","uninfected birds","subclinically infected pigeons","immunogenic PiCV recombinant capsid protein","high prevalence of PiCV asymptomatic infections","V1 groups","groups V","vaccination of asymptomatic","groups C","expression of genes","week-old carrier pigeons","dpv","expression of CD8","similar immune response","IFN-\u03B3 genes","days post vaccination","potential cellular immune response","pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein","SBC","immunosuppressive pigeon circovirus","adjuvant","Study results","global pigeon breeding","potential tool","CD8 T lymphocyte receptors","CD4","secreting B cells","severe health problem","rate","C1","disease control","question","suppression of humoral immunity","practice","aim","light","seroconversion"],"language":"en"},

We developed a modeling framework to evaluate this contribution and key epidemic features of the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique in 2015\u20132016 from the joint analysis of a household transmission study (n = 68 households), a study among symptomatic pregnant women (n = 281), and seroprevalence surveys of blood donors (n = 457). We estimated that the probability of mosquito-mediated within-household transmission (from an infected member to a susceptible one) was 21% (95% credible interval (CrI): 5, 51), and the overall probability of infection from outside the household (i.e., in the community) was 39% (95% CrI: 27, 50). Overall, 50% (95% CrI: 43, 58) of the population was infected, with 22% (95% CrI: 5, 46) of infections acquired in households and 40% (95% CrI: 23, 56) being asymptomatic. The probability of presenting with Zika-like symptoms due to another cause was 16% (95% CrI: 10, 23).

They constitute an early diverging novel monophyletic clade within the Avastrovirus phylogeny, representing a putative new astrovirus species (provisionally designated as Avastrovirus 5) according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification criteria. Their genomic organization shares some characteristics with Avastrovirus but also with Mamastrovirus.

Identifying direct interactions between the mosquito miRNAs and the RNA genome of arboviruses and choosing the relevant miRNA candidates to explore resulting antiviral mechanisms are critical. Here, we carried out genomic analyses to identify Aedes aegypti miRNAs that potentially interact with various lineages and genotypes of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. By using prediction tools with distinct algorithms, several miRNA binding sites were commonly found within different genotypes/and or lineages of each arbovirus. We further analyzed those miRNAs that could target more than one arbovirus, required a low energy threshold to form miRNA-viralRNA (vRNA) complexes, and predicted potential RNA structures using RNAhybrid software. We predicted miRNA candidates that might participate in regulating arboviral replication in Ae. aegypti. Even without any experimental validation, which should be done as a next step, this study can shed further light on the role of miRNA in mosquito innate immunity and targets for future studies.","publish_time":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yen, Pei-Shi; Chen, Chun-Hong; Sreenu, Vattipally; Kohl, Alain; Failloux, Anna-Bella","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/393091a75a8617bf9fd5127a834c16743a9e89cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631873.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of miRNA","mosquito miRNAs","miRNA-viralRNA","relevant miRNA candidates","mosquito antiviral immunity","miRNA binding sites","mosquito innate immunity","role of mosquito cellular microRNA","potential RNA structures","RNA genome of arboviruses","role of exogenous small interfering RNA","Aedes aegypti miRNAs","genotypes of chikungunya","various lineages","antiviral mechanisms","different genotypes","siRNA","distinct algorithms","complexes","targets","piRNA","P-element","PIWI","dengue","pathways","low energy threshold","wimpy testis","future studies","RNAhybrid software","vRNA","genomic analyses","prediction tools","little knowledge","Zika viruses","direct interactions","light","arboviral replication","study","experimental validation","step"],"language":"en"},

They are categorized into three classes; IFN1 and IFN3 are the primary antiviral cytokine lineages, while IFN2 responds to a broader variety of pathogens. The evolutionary relationships within and between these three classes have proven difficult to resolve. Here, we reassess interferon evolution, considering key phylogenetic pitfalls including taxon sampling, alignment quality, model adequacy, and outgroup choice. We reveal that cartilaginous fishes, and hence the jawed vertebrate ancestor, possess(ed) orthologs of all three interferon classes. We show that IFN3 groups sister to IFN1, resolve the origins of the human IFN3 lineages, and find that intronless IFN3s emerged at least three times. IFN2 genes are highly conserved, except for IFN-\u03B3-rel, which we confirm resulted from a teleost-specific duplication. Our analyses show that IFN1 phylogeny is highly sensitive to phylogenetic error. By accounting for this, we describe a new backbone IFN1 phylogeny that implies several IFN1 genes existed in the jawed vertebrate ancestor. One of these is represented by the intronless IFN1s of tetrapods, including mammalian-like repertoires of reptile IFN1s and a subset of amphibian IFN1s, in addition to newly-identified intron-containing shark IFN1 genes. IFN-f, previously only found in teleosts, likely represents another ancestral jawed vertebrate IFN1 family member, suggesting the current classification of fish IFN1s into two groups based on the number of cysteines may need revision. The providence of the remaining fish IFN1s and the coelacanth IFN1s proved difficult to resolve, but they may also be ancestral jawed vertebrate IFN1 lineages. Finally, a large group of amphibian-specific IFN1s falls sister to all other IFN1s and was likely also present in the jawed vertebrate ancestor. Our results verify that intronless IFN1s have evolved multiple times in amphibians and indicate that no one-to-one orthology exists between mammal and reptile IFN1s. Our data also imply that diversification of the multiple IFN1s present in the jawed vertebrate ancestor has occurred through a rapid birth-death process, consistent with functional maintenance over a 450-million-year host-pathogen arms race. In summary, this study reveals a new model of interferon evolution important to our understanding of jawed vertebrate antiviral immunity.","publish_time":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Redmond, Anthony K.; Zou, Jun; Secombes, Christopher J.; Macqueen, Daniel J.; Dooley, Helen","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c76b6ad3636678e30cdb1093360aa425ba71928.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6640115.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6640115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific IFN1s","jawed vertebrate ancestor","coelacanth IFN1s","ancestral jawed vertebrate IFN1 lineages","intronless IFN1s of tetrapods","multiple IFN1s present","subset of amphibian IFN1s","remaining fish IFN1s","repertoires of reptile IFN1s","ancestral jawed vertebrate IFN1 family member","jawed vertebrates","understanding of jawed vertebrate antiviral immunity","shark IFN1 genes","current classification of fish IFN1s","new backbone IFN1 phylogeny","interferon classes","IFN2 genes","human IFN3 lineages","IFN3 groups sister","new model of interferon evolution important","primary antiviral cytokine lineages","host antiviral responses","multiple times","intronless IFN3s","model adequacy","phylogenetic error","IFN-\u03B3","IFN-f","key phylogenetic pitfalls","large group of amphibian","teleost-specific duplication","year host-pathogen arms race","taxon sampling","alignment quality","rapid birth-death process","mammalian","origins","functional maintenance","study","addition","diversification","orthologs","Interferons","outgroup choice","number of cysteines","teleosts","orthology","providence","amphibians","broader variety of pathogens","cartilaginous fishes","revision","summary","analyses","results","evolutionary relationships","data","accounting"],"language":"en"},

We report the first case of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection that had significant improvement with corticosteroid treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old male admitted to intensive care unit because of respiratory failure. He was diagnosed as severe pneumonia caused by avian influenza H7N9 viral infection. After initial clinical improvement supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the patient\u2019s condition worsened with persistent fever, refractory hypoxemia. Chest x-rays and computed tomographies showed areas of consolidation and ground glass opacification. Although OP was suspected and 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone was used, the patient\u2019s condition didn\u2019t improved considerably. An open lung biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the specimen was compatible with OP. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg for 5 days.

CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of successful management of refractory severe respiratory failure caused by avian influenza H7N9 infection complicated with OP.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients (severe to critical) during Jan-2011 to Feb-2018 from five hospitals, followed by a systematic analysis of cases from 2017 to 2018 (n = 289) and all previous epidemics during 2011\u20132017 (n = 169). RESULTS: In-hospital fatality was over 5-folds higher during the 2017\u20132018 (p \u003C 0.01) in which 19 patients died (6.6%), whereas only 2 mortalities (1.2%) were observed during 2011\u20132017. Of the 289 hospitalized in 2017\u20132018, 153 were confirmed with influenza B virus, 110 with A/H1N1pdm09, and 26 A/H3N2, whereas A/H1N1pdm09 was the predominant cause of hospitalization in previous seasons combined (45%). Fatal cases in 2017\u20132018 were exclusively associated with either influenza B or A/H1N1pdm09. Our results show that a significant lower proportion of patients aged 14 or greater were treated with oseltamivir, during the 2017\u20132018 epidemic, and exhibited higher levels of clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital fatality rate might be significantly higher in the 2017\u20132018 season in China. A sufficient supply of oseltamivir and antiviral therapy within 48 h from onset could reduce fatality rates.

It aids in planning and response activities specific to the event but is often overlooked by the event organizers. This paper reports the content validity process of a newly developed tool called Mass Gathering Risk Assessment Tool (MGRAT), which intends to assess the risks associated with religious mass gathering events in Indian settings. METHODS: Qualitative approach was followed to identify the risks associated with mass gathering events and to identify the domains and items to be included in the RA tool. The draft tool was shared with six experts who were selected by the convenient method; selected experts were requested to assess the tool and give their comments about the domains, items, relevant responses, and overall presentation of the tool using content validity questionnaire. Content validity index and Fleiss kappa statistics were calculated to assess the agreement between multiple raters. RESULTS: Agreement proportion expressed as scale-level content validity index (S-CVI) calculated by the averaging method is 0.92. S-CVI; calculated by universal agreement is 0.78. Fleiss kappa statistics to measure the agreement between multiple experts after adjusting the component of the chance agreement is 0.522 (95% CI: 0.417, 0.628, P value: 0.001). CONCLUSION: MGRAT is a valid tool, which has an appropriate level of content validity. As the number of raters increases, there will be difficulty in achieving consensus among all the items, which is the reason for lower Content Validity Index/Universal Average (CVI/UA) when compared with Content Validity Index/Average (CVI/Ave). Fleiss kappa statistics also indicated moderate agreement among the raters beyond the chance agreement, which also supports the appropriate content validity of MGRAT.","publish_time":"2019-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Upasana; Desikachari, BR; Sarma, Sankara","journal":"J Family Med Prim Care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6691416.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mass Gathering Risk Assessment Tool","RA","MGRAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["content validity process","content validity questionnaire","lower Content Validity Index","appropriate content validity of MGRAT","appropriate level of content validity","scale-level content validity index","universal agreement","RA tool","chance agreement","developed tool","Agreement proportion","valid tool","moderate agreement","draft tool","Risk Assessment Tool","events","S-CVI","Fleiss kappa statistics","items","religious mass","multiple experts","multiple raters","selected experts","Universal Average","domains","risks","number of raters","convenient method","averaging method","event organizers","overall presentation","relevant responses","reason","response activities specific","Indian settings","component","potential health hazards","planning","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","comments","paper","Qualitative approach","METHODS","P value","consensus","difficulty"],"language":"en"},

Developing standards for abiotic and biotic characteristics would provide quantitative metrics for comparison across different data types and observational time frames. The evidence for life detection falls into three categories of biosignatures: (1) substances, such as elemental abundances, isotopes, molecules, allotropes, enantiomers, minerals, and their associated properties; (2) objects that are physical features such as mats, fossils including trace-fossils and microbialites (stromatolites), and concretions; and (3) patterns, such as physical three-dimensional or conceptual n-dimensional relationships of physical or chemical phenomena, including patterns of intermolecular abundances of organic homologues, and patterns of stable isotopic abundances between and within compounds. Five key challenges that warrant future exploration by the astrobiology community include the following: (1) examining phenomena at the \u201Cright\u201D spatial scales because biosignatures may elude us if not examined with the appropriate instrumentation or modeling approach at that specific scale; (2) identifying the precise context across multiple spatial and temporal scales to understand how tangible biosignatures may or may not be preserved; (3) increasing capability to mine big data sets to reveal relationships, for example, how Earth\u0027s mineral diversity may have evolved in conjunction with life; (4) leveraging cyberinfrastructure for data management of biosignature types, characteristics, and classifications; and (5) using three-dimensional to n-D representations of biotic and abiotic models overlain on multiple overlapping spatial and temporal relationships to provide new insights.","publish_time":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Marjorie A.; Hinman, Nancy W.; Potter-McIntyre, Sally L.; Schubert, Keith E.; Gillams, Richard J.; Awramik, Stanley M.; Boston, Penelope J.; Bower, Dina M.; Des Marais, David J.; Farmer, Jack D.; Jia, Tony Z.; King, Penelope L.; Hazen, Robert M.; L\u00E9veill\u00E9, Richard J.; Papineau, Dominic; Rempfert, Kaitlin R.; S\u00E1nchez-Rom\u00E1n, M\u00F3nica; Spear, John R.; Southam, Gordon; Stern, Jennifer C.; Cleaves, Henderson James","journal":"Astrobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/002c8c43cea5f3ec8c97d30fe181c01b919d789a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6708275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Earth"],"keyphrases":["multiple scales","spatial scales","life detection","Microbial life","extraterrestrial life","temporal relationships","physical features","temporal scales","different data types","conceptual n-dimensional relationships of physical","biotic characteristics","data management of biosignature types","patterns of stable isotopic abundances","elemental abundances","categories of biosignatures","tangible biosignatures","patterns of intermolecular abundances of organic homologues","big data sets","Earth\u0027s critical zone","abiotic models","n-D representations of biotic","trace-fossils","chemical phenomena","biological processes","vast time","nonliving processes","geological features untouched","observational time frames","Earth\u0027s mineral diversity","comparison","quantitative metrics","molecules","future exploration","modeling approach","minerals","enantiomers","isotopes","allotropes","microbialites","example","mats","cyberinfrastructure","precise context","beginning","astrobiology community","stromatolites","objects","Universe","astrobiologists","appropriate instrumentation","specific scale","associated properties","new insights","sedimentary rock record","key challenges","abiosignatures","following","concretions","capability","compounds","search","conjunction","substances","standards","classifications","compares","planet\u0027s surface","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, proposed exoskeleton reduces the force of inertia that the wearer experiences. In addition, the lower frame length of the exoskeleton can be changed to align with the complex movement of the knee. Furthermore, the length between the knee center of rotation and the ankle (LBKA) is measured by using this structure, and the LBKA values are used as the data for intention detection. These value helps to detect the intention because it changes faster than a motor encoder value. A neural network was trained using the motor encoder values, and LBKA values.

The health care infrastructure in Iraq is inadequately prepared to serve the health needs of the millions of pilgrims. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the temporary health care facilities installed and run by the local community to provide health care services to Arbaeenia pilgrims in Karbala, Iraq. METHODS: A survey was conducted in all community-based health care facilities located along part of Najaf to Karbala road within Karbala governorate. A structured questionnaire was answered through an interview with the workers and direct observation. Data were collected on staff profile, type of services provided, use of basic infection control measures, medical equipment, drugs and supplies, and the most commonly encountered medical problems. RESULTS: The total number of health care facilities was 120, staffed by 659 workers. Only 18 (15.0%, 18/120) facilities were licensed, and 44.1% (53/120) of the workers were health professionals. The health care workers provided different services including dispensing drugs (370/1692, 21.87%), measuring blood pressure and blood sugar (350/1692, 20.69%), and caring for wounds and injuries (319/1692, 18.85%). Around 97% (116/120) health facilities provided services for musculoskeletal disorders and only 16.7% (20/120) provided services for injuries. The drugs available in the clinic were analgesics, drugs for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, and antibiotics, with an availability range of 13.3% to 100.0%. Infection control practices for individual protection, environmental sanitation, and medical waste disposal were available in a range of 18.1% to 100.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based health care facilities experienced a profound shortage of trained human resources and medical supplies. They can significantly contribute to health services if they are adequately equipped and follow standardized operation procedures.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lami, Faris; Hameed, Inam; Arbaji, Ali","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f20c8063e9b843c787707e5fc938200b3fd14ebf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6800459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6800459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Karbala","Iraq","Najaf"],"keyphrases":["health services","health facilities","health care services","health care workers","health care infrastructure","temporary health care facilities","health needs","health professionals","community-based health care facilities","total number of health care facilities","different services","type of services","medical supplies","drugs available","Iraq","medical equipment","dispensing drugs","medical problems","Karbala road","Karbala governorate","medical waste disposal","local community","Arbaeenia pilgrims","injuries","Infection control practices","basic infection control measures","millions of pilgrims","Arbaeenia mass","blood pressure","blood sugar","availability range","environmental sanitation","profound shortage of trained human resources","individual protection","analgesics","Najaf","antibiotics","interview","clinic","respiratory diseases","staff profile","musculoskeletal disorders","CONCLUSIONS","direct observation","study","RESULTS","largest MGs","world","standardized operation procedures","structured questionnaire","Data","BACKGROUND","survey","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","wounds"],"language":"en"},

Several studies have suggested that T1IFNs also contribute very substantially to the secondary (recall) response; they are thought (i) to be required to drive the early attrition of memory T cells, (ii) to support the subsequent expansion of surviving virus-specific memory cells, and (iii) to assist in the suppression and clearance of the infectious agent. However, many of these observations were predicated upon models in which T1IFN signaling was interrupted prior to a primary immune response, raising the possibility that the resulting memory cells might be intrinsically abnormal. We have directly addressed this by using an inducible-Cre model system in which the host remains genetically-intact during the primary response to infection, and in which T1IFN signaling can be effectively ablated prior to secondary viral challenge. We report that, in stark contrast to primary infection, T1IFN signaling is not required during the recall response. IFN\u03B1\u03B2R-deficient memory CD8(\u002B) and CD4(\u002B) memory T cells undergo attrition and expansion with kinetics that are indistinguishable from those of receptor-sufficient cells. Moreover, even in the absence of functional T1IFN signaling, the host\u2019s immune capacity to rapidly suppress, and then to eradicate, a secondary infection remains intact. Thus, this study shows that T1IFN signaling is dispensable during the recall response to a virus infection. Moreover, two broader implications may be drawn. First, a T cell\u2019s requirement for a cytokine is highly dependent on the cell\u2019s maturation / differentiation status. Consequently, second, these data underscore the importance of evaluating a gene\u2019s impact by modulating its expression or function in a temporally-controllable manner.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosking, Martin P.; Flynn, Claudia T.; Whitton, J.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10774671, presumably responsible for alternate splicing of this gene, has frequently been associated with a variety of viral diseases, including emerging respiratory infections. We investigated the SNP-dependent expression of OAS1 variants in primary cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. Total RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR with specific primer sets designed to amplify each transcript variant. We found that the p46 transcript was mainly expressed in cells with the GG genotype, whereas the p42 transcript was highly expressed, and the p44a (alternate exon in intron 5), p48, and p52 transcripts were expressed to a lesser extent, in cells with the AA genotype. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the p46 isoform and a smaller amount of the p42 isoform were present in cells with the GG genotype, whereas only the p42 isoform was clearly observed in cells with the AA genotype. Cellular DNA fragmentation induced by neutrophil elastase was more preferentially found in cells with the AA genotype. Thus, our findings provide insights into the potential role of OAS1 polymorphisms in respiratory infection.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noguchi, Satoshi; Hamano, Emi; Matsushita, Ikumi; Hijikata, Minako; Ito, Hideyuki; Nagase, Takahide; Keicho, Naoto","journal":"Human Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/742fd14b9bd7da21152e470d64a16dd60be21466.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115495.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220500/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198885912006180; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885912006180; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2012.11.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Immunoblot"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AA genotype","GG genotype","p42 isoform","p42 transcript","p46 isoform","p46 transcript","viral infection","transcript variant","primary cultured human bronchial epithelial cells","SNP-dependent expression of OAS1 variants","potential role of OAS1 polymorphisms","alternate exon","alternate splicing","emerging respiratory infections","variety of viral diseases","critical component","real-time RT-PCR","rs10774671","host defense system","specific primer sets","major interferon-inducible proteins","neutrophil elastase","p48","Cellular DNA fragmentation","intron","insights","lesser extent","single nucleotide polymorphism","p52 transcripts","Total RNA","findings","p44a","gene","oligoadenylate synthetase","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Several different infectious agents can cause neurodegenerative conditions, with prominent examples being human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) dementia and prion disorders.

Infectious agents may enter the central nervous system in infected migratory macrophages, by transcytosis across blood\u2013brain barrier cells or by intraneuronal transfer from peripheral nerves. Synapses and lipid rafts are important sites at which infectious agents may enter neurons and/or exert their cytotoxic effects. Recent findings suggest the possibility that infectious agents may increase the risk of common age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke. While scenarios can be envisioned whereby viruses such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, herpes simplex and influenza promote damage to neurons during aging, there is no conclusive evidence for a major role of these pathogens in neurodegenerative disorders.

Emergency Department (ED)-based syndromic surveillance systems have been introduced for early detection of infectious outbreaks. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a forecasting model of respiratory infectious disease outbreaks based on a nationwide ED syndromic surveillance using daily number of emergency department visits with fever. METHODS: We measured the number of daily ED visits with body temperature \u2265 38.0 \u00B0C and daily number of patients diagnosed as respiratory illness by the ICD-10 codes from the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database of Seoul, Korea. We developed a forecast model according to the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method using the NEDIS data from 2013 to 2014 and validated it using the data from 2015. We defined alarming criteria for extreme numbers of ED febrile visits that exceed the forecasted number. Finally, the predictive performance of the alarm generated by the forecast model was estimated. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2015, data of 4,080,766 ED visits were collected. 303,469 (7.4%) were ED visits with fever, and 388,943 patients (9.5%) were diagnosed with respiratory infectious disease. The ARIMA (7.0.7) model was the most suitable model for predicting febrile ED visits the next day. The number of patients with respiratory infectious disease spiked concurrently with the alarms generated by the forecast model. CONCLUSIONS: A forecast model using syndromic surveillance based on the number of ED visits was feasible for early detection of ED respiratory infectious disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2018-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Tae Han; Hong, Ki Jeong; Shin, Sang Do; Park, Gwan Jin; Kim, Sungwan; Hong, Nhayoung","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3255f63d5509232c3755c6294ae43caf9f5fe22f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126969.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2018.05.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073567571830370X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29779674/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073567571830370X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Emergency Department","National Emergency Department Information System","Autoregressive Integrated","ARIMA"],"locations":["Seoul","Korea"],"keyphrases":["number of ED visits","number of daily ED visits","febrile ED","forecast model","forecasting model of respiratory infectious disease outbreaks","early detection of ED respiratory infectious disease outbreak","daily number of emergency department visits","sudden outbreaks of respiratory infectious disease","nationwide ED syndromic surveillance","daily number of patients","extreme numbers of ED febrile visits","suitable model","forecasted number","respiratory illness","early detection of infectious outbreaks","NEDIS data","syndromic surveillance systems","ARIMA","fever","National Emergency Department Information System","codes","Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average","body temperature","database of Seoul","alarming criteria","ICD","Monitoring","alarms","Korea","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","predictive performance","day","aim","study","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Damage to the heart is induced both directly by virally mediated cell destruction and indirectly due to the immune and autoimmune processes reacting to virus infection. This review addresses antiviral therapeutics for cardiac coxsackievirus infections discovered over the last 25 years. One group represents pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances that inhibit virus uptake by binding to the virus capsid (e.g., pleconaril) or inactivate viral proteins (e.g., NO-metoprolol and ribavirin) or inhibit cellular proteins which are essential for viral replication (e.g., ubiquitination inhibitors). A second important group of substances are interferons. They have antiviral but also immunomodulating activities. The third and most recently discovered group includes biological and cellular therapeutics. Soluble receptor analogues (e.g., sCAR-Fc) bind to the virus capsid and block virus uptake. Small interfering RNAs, short hairpin RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides bind to and led to degradation of the viral RNA genome or cellular RNAs, thereby preventing their translation and viral replication. Most recently mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has been shown to possess antiviral activity in CVB3 infections. Taken together, a number of antiviral therapeutics has been developed for the treatment of myocardial CVB infection in recent years. In addition to low molecular weight inhibitors, biological therapeutics have become promising anti-viral agents.","publish_time":"2011-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fechner, Henry; Pinkert, Sandra; Geisler, Anja; Poller, Wolfgang; Kurreck, Jens","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa0630536ffb3bc1d387a3bfea810be65fd6f950.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6264230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21989310/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16108475","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular therapeutics","virus capsid","viral proteins","viral replication","biological therapeutics","cellular RNAs","number of antiviral therapeutics","block virus uptake","cellular proteins","antiviral activity","discovered group","viral RNA genome","promising anti-viral agents","low molecular weight inhibitors","CVB3 infections","important group of substances","active low molecular weight substances","short hairpin RNAs","Small interfering RNAs","treatment of myocardial CVB infection","ubiquitination inhibitors","infectious agents","recent years","cardiac coxsackievirus infections","mediated cell destruction","mesenchymal stem cell transplantation","antisense oligonucleotides","binding","chronic myocarditis","sCAR-Fc","degradation","autoimmune processes","review","addition","translation","pleconaril","Soluble receptor analogues","Subtype B coxsackieviruses","interferons","metoprolol","ribavirin","common variant","immunomodulating activities","Damage","heart"],"language":"en"},

Several diseases are associated with EBV, including Hodgkin\u0027s and post-transplant lymphomas, oral hairy leukoplakia, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. EBV has a double-stranded 172-kb DNA genome. Upon infection, the genome circularizes and persists as an episome in infected cells. More than 70 open reading frames exist, which encode proteins expressed during lytic and latent EBV infection. Lytic proteins encode viral proteins, which are necessary for the production of infectious virions, whereas latent proteins are needed to set up persistent infection by transforming and immortalizing host cells. EBV also encodes non-translated RNAs (e.g., EBER1 and EBER2), which are almost ubiquitously expressed and highly abundant in EBV-infected cells. Four EBV latency programs have been described with distinct sets of expressed proteins and viral RNAs: (1) Latency 0: EBER1 and EBER2 but no expression of proteins; (2) Latency 1 (true latency program): EBER1 and EBER2, EBNA1; (3) Latency 2 (default program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA1, latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, LMP2A, LMP2B; and (4) Latency 3 (growth program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA-leader protein (LP), EBNA 2\u20136, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B.

We also showed that N protein activated IL-6 expression through NF-\u03BAB by facilitating the translocation of NF-\u03BAB from cytosol to nucleus. Mutational analyses revealed that two regions of N protein were essential for its function in the activation of IL-6. These results provided new insights into understanding the mechanism involved in the function of SARS-CoV N protein and pathogenesis of the virus.","publish_time":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xue; Wu, Kailang; Wang, Di; Yue, Xin; Song, Degui; Zhu, Ying; Wu, Jianguo","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ea138d9b7afee3e1f18e06a7afd4464dbd7d706.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103332.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207002620; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207002620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mutational"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV N protein","regions of N protein","regulation of IL","activation of IL","NF-\u03BAB element","expression","NF-\u03BAB binding element","translocation of NF","function of SARS","roles of SARS","SARS patients","Promoter analyses","Results","CoV proteins","Mutational analyses","lung lesions","pathogenesis","viral nucleocapsid","cytosol","Abstract High levels of interleukin","acute stage","concentration-dependent manner","new insights","nucleus","virus","event","studies","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Here, we describe the development of a virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) that increases the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization. The system uses ~2 million probes that cover the genomes of members of the 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans. A biotinylated oligonucleotide library was synthesized on the NimbleGen cleavable array platform and used for solution-based capture of viral nucleic acids present in complex samples containing variable proportions of viral and host nucleic acids. The use of VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in a 100- to 10,000-fold increase in viral reads from blood and tissue homogenates compared to conventional Illumina sequencing using established virus enrichment procedures, including filtration, nuclease treatments, and RiboZero rRNA subtraction. VirCapSeq-VERT had a limit of detection comparable to that of agent-specific real-time PCR in serum, blood, and tissue extracts. Furthermore, the method identified novel viruses whose genomes were approximately 40% different from the known virus genomes used for designing the probe library. The VirCapSeq-VERT platform is ideally suited for analyses of virome composition and dynamics. Importance VirCapSeq-VERT enables detection of viral sequences in complex sample backgrounds, including those found in clinical specimens, such as serum, blood, and tissue. The highly multiplexed nature of the system allows both the simultaneous identification and the comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The operational simplicity and efficiency of the VirCapSeq-VERT platform may facilitate transition of high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostic as well as research applications.","publish_time":"2015-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Briese, Thomas; Kapoor, Amit; Mishra, Nischay; Jain, Komal; Kumar, Arvind; Jabado, Omar J.; Lipkin, W.

Serodiagnostic methods, typically ELISA (with either native or recombinant antigens), are often used for early diagnosis. The use of native antigens, as in the MM3-SERO ELISA (commercialized as BIO K 211, BIO-X Diagnostics), continues to be beneficial in terms of sensitivity and specificity; however, there is interest in developing ELISA tests based on recombinant antigens to avoid the need to culture parasites. Of the antigens secreted by adult flukes, recombinant procathepsin L1 (rFhpCL1) is the most commonly tested in ELISA to date. However, although adult flukes produce three different clades of CLs (FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5), to our knowledge, the diagnostic value of recombinant FhCL2 and FhCL5 has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we developed and tested three indirect ELISAs using rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 and evaluated their recognition by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with F. hepatica. Although the overall antibody response to these three rFhpCLs was similar, some animals displayed preferential recognition for particular rFhpCLs. Moreover, for cattle sera, the highest sensitivity was obtained using rFhpCL2 (97%), being equal for both rFhpCL1 and rFhpCL5 (87.9%), after adjusting cut-offs for maximum specificity. By contrast, for sheep sera, the sensitivity was 100% for the three rFhpCLs. Finally, the presence of truncated and/or partially unfolded molecules in antigen preparations is postulated as a possible source of cross-reactivity.","publish_time":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Sern\u00E1ndez, Victoria; Perteguer, Mar\u00EDa J.; Hern\u00E1ndez-Gonz\u00E1lez, Ana; Mezo, Mercedes; Gonz\u00E1lez-Warleta, Marta; Orbegozo-Medina, Ricardo A.; Romar\u00EDs, Fernanda; Paniagua, Esperanza; G\u00E1rate, Teresa; Ubeira, Florencio M.","journal":"Parasitol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f3802f9143f0aaf055fb3febecb171822ce6961.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29564626/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-018-5809-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["F. hepatica"],"organizations":["BIO K"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant antigens","rFhpCL1","cattle sera","sheep sera","use of native antigens","recombinant procathepsin L1","diagnostic value of recombinant FhCL2","adult flukes","FhCL5","particular rFhpCLs","developing ELISA tests","highest sensitivity","MM3-SERO ELISA","rFhpCL2","terms of sensitivity","rFhpCL5","preferential recognition","Fasciola hepatica","maximum specificity","BIO-X Diagnostics","animals","different clades of CLs","important economic losses","great importance","FhCL1","antigen preparations","veterinary field","possible source of cross","unfolded molecules","livestock producers","knowledge","overall antibody response","reactivity","indirect ELISAs","need","presence of truncated","cut-offs","Infections","Serodiagnostic methods","contrast","early diagnosis","present study","parasites","date"],"language":"en"},

This includes inflammatory bowel disease, viral and non-viral associated intestinal lymphomas and immunodeficiency associated syndromes. Morphologic and phenotypic characterization of the normal small intestinal diffuse MALT in 22 SPF cats was performed using flow cytometry and cytology on isolated intestinal leukocytes from the intra-epithelial and lamina proprial compartments, as well as immunohistology on tissues from the feline duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The intra-epithelial compartment (IEC) was dominated by lymphocytes (\u003E85%) which frequently contained intracytoplasmic granules. The most striking findings in the IEC were the elevated percentages of CD8\u03B1\u002B lymphocytes (40%), presumed to express CD8\u03B1\u03B1 chains, and CD4\u2212/CD8\u2212 (double negative) lymphocytes (44%), and the consistent presence of a minor subpopulation of CD3\u002B/CD11d\u002B IELs (6%). Small percentages of CD4\u002B lymphocytes (10%) were observed such that the IEL CD4:CD8 ratio (0.25) was low. The LPC also contained a majority of T cells and few plasma cells. However, this compartment had reduced percentages of CD8\u03B1\u002B lymphocytes (28%) and increased percentages of CD4\u002B lymphocytes (27%) relative to the IEC. However, the LPL CD4:CD8 ratio (1.0) remained low compared with the ratio in peripheral blood. In feline MALT, MHC class II expression was lower than in other peripheral lymphoid compartments.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients transported by the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) for confirmed or suspected Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to investigate surge capacity of, and operational implications for, the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19. Methods Prospective cohort study. To determine the characteristics of patients transported for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we included patient data from 02 February 2020 to 06 May 2020. To investigate surge capacity and operational implications for RFDS in dealing with COVID-19, we built, and validated, an interactive operations area level discrete-event simulation decision support model, underpinned by RFDS aeromedical activity data from 2015 to 2019 (4-years). This model was subsequently used in a factorial in silico experiment to systematically investigate both the supply of RFDS aeromedical services and the increased rates of demand for these services, for diseases of the respiratory system. Results The RFDS conducted 291 patient episodes of care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This included 288 separate patients, including 136 males and 119 females (gender missing=33), with a median age of 62.0 years (IQR=43.5-74.9). The simulation decision support model we developed is capable of providing dynamic and real-time support for RFDS decision-makers in understanding the system\u0027s performance under uncertain COVID-19 demand. With increased COVID-19 related demand, the ability of the RFDS to cope will be driven by the number of aircraft available. The simulation model provided each aviation section with estimated numbers of aircraft required to meet a range of anticipated demands. Conclusion Despite the lack of certainty in the actual level of COVID-19 related demand for RFDS services, modelling demonstrates that robustness of meeting such demand increases with the number of operational and medically staffed aircraft.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gardiner, Fergus W; Johns, Hannah; Bishop, Lara; Churilov, Leonid","journal":"Air medical journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ed8b3f98f2b0c16f457c6e70a4dac8f0452b594.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amj.2020.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425475/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067991X20301188?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1067991X20301188","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Royal Flying Doctor Service","RFDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RFDS services","suspected COVID","increased COVID","uncertain COVID","RFDS decision-makers","actual level of COVID","supply of RFDS aeromedical services","related demand","simulation model","RFDS aeromedical activity data","demand increases","increased rates of demand","operational implications","number of operational","characteristics of patients","real-time support","interactive operations area level discrete-event simulation decision support model","surge capacity","number of aircraft available","staffed aircraft","separate patients","patient data","years","estimated numbers of aircraft","suspected Coronavirus disease","patient episodes of care","aviation section","Royal Flying Doctor Service","system\u0027s performance","robustness","modelling","lack of certainty","diseases","ability","Methods Prospective cohort study","females","gender missing","median age","IQR","factorial","cope","silico experiment","respiratory system","range of anticipated demands","Conclusion","Abstract Introduction","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

However, the information found on the internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms \u201CPrevention coronavirus,\u201D \u201CPrevention COVID-19,\u201D \u201CPrevenci\u00F3n coronavirus,\u201D and \u201CPrevenci\u00F3n COVID-19\u201D. A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was \u201Cwash your hands frequently\u201D (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to \u201Cstay home if you feel unwell\u201D (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as \u201Cwash your hands frequently\u201D (OR 9.82), \u201Ccover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze\u201D (OR 4.59), or \u201Cstay home if you feel unwell\u201D (OR 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the internet. In this way, users will be able to obtain high-quality information more frequently, and such websites may improve their accessibility and positioning, given that search engines justify the positioning of links obtained in a search based on the frequency of access to them.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hern\u00E1ndez-Garc\u00EDa, Ignacio; Gim\u00E9nez-J\u00FAlvez, Teresa","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117090.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Spain","United States"],"keyphrases":["Prevention COVID","Prevenci\u00F3n COVID","internet","suspected COVID","websites of official public health organizations","large source of health information","Prevention coronavirus","high-quality information","users","Prevenci\u00F3n coronavirus","World Health Organization","prevention of coronavirus disease","search engines","significant differences","Google search","United States","country of publication","Spain","recommendations","OBJECTIVE","hands","study","digital media sources","scientific societies","type of authorship","positioning of links","scientific rigor","preventive measures","univariate analysis","frequent recommendation","cause of great concern","governments","tissue","nose","bent elbow","terms","mouth","factor","association","person","odds ratio","accessibility","capacity","RESULTS","total","weblinks","mask","frequency of access","way","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","content","sneeze","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Because the virus can establish latency, re-activation may be relatively common after transplantation. Methods We assessed adenovirus infection in 80 adult lung transplant recipients. Adenovirus polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR assay; limit of detection \u223C25 copies/ml plasma) was done on plasma samples collected at regular intervals until 1 year post-transplant. Results Adenovirus DNA was detected in 18 of 80 patients (22.5%) and in 19 of 595 (3.4%) plasma samples up to 12 months post-transplant. Median time to detection of viremia was 134 days post-transplant (range 1 to 370 days). Median viral load was 180 copies/ml plasma (range 50 to 360 copies/ml). Symptoms were evaluated at the time of adenovirus detection: 14 of 18 (78%) patients were asymptomatic; 4 of 18 (22%) patients had otherwise unexplained febrile/flu-like illness that resolved spontaneously.

However, key aspects of MVA biology require further research in order to provide data needed to evaluate the potential risks that may occur due to the use of MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines. The purpose of this paper is to identify knowledge gaps in the biology of MVA and recombinant MVA that are of relevance to its hazard characterization and discuss ongoing and future experiments aimed at providing data necessary to fill in the knowledge gaps.

Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids is expected to prevent cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with almost no intake of oily fish and those not taking statins.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of increasing awareness of TB and reducing the associated stigmas to reduce the incidence of TB and enable earlier diagnosis and effective treatment. This study investigated the knowledge and beliefs about transmission, symptoms and treatment of TB as well as attitudes towards patients with TB among the Roma population in Belgrade. METHODS: The focus-group method was considered to be appropriate for investigating knowledge and beliefs about TB. A total of 24 Roma people aged 19-55 years participated in three focus-group discussions. RESULTS: All participants knew that TB was a pulmonary disease and could be contagious. Saliva was the most commonly mentioned mode of transmission. Some individuals thought, albeit hesitantly, that TB could be transmitted by shaking hands with an infected individual. Of factors contributing to TB, participants mentioned bad living conditions, low quality and lack of food, and stress. Participants quoted chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, loss of appetite, loss of weight, weakness and sweating as basic symptoms of TB. Participants believed that effective treatment should include resting, taking prescribed medicines, inhaling fresh air and eating \u0022strong\u0022 food such as bacon and pork; these approaches were considered as important as taking antibiotics). In addition, participants mentioned that they use some folk medicines. Relatives and friends, and to a lesser extent television, were the main sources of information about TB. Participants most appreciate personal contact with doctors as a source of information. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that participants were aware of the seriousness TB as well as some of the modes of transmission; however, they had some misconceptions. An important finding was the confidence in doctors expressed by the Roma people.","publish_time":"2011-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vukovic, Dejana S; Nagorni-Obradovic, Ljudmila M","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a1e091e9ed956fa71921a76e014e1694c855d04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3210101.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22023788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of TB","participants","incidence of TB","seriousness TB","basic symptoms of TB","importance of increasing awareness of TB","Roma population","Roma people","effective treatment","mentioned mode of transmission","doctors","beliefs","important finding","knowledge","modes of transmission","important health problem","focus-group method","focus-group discussions","loss of appetite","loss of weight","lack of food","prescribed medicines","source of information","folk medicines","main sources of information","bad living conditions","low quality","haemoptysis","cough","weakness","earlier diagnosis","patients","fresh air","chest pain","lesser extent television","bacon","personal contact","resting","associated stigmas","confidence","years","attitudes","pulmonary disease","friends","pork","approaches","METHODS","hands","Serbia","Tuberculosis","Belgrade","Recent studies","infected individual","stress","Saliva","study","BACKGROUND","total","RESULTS","factors","Relatives","antibiotics","addition","CONCLUSIONS","misconceptions","individuals"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We genetically engineered the L. plantarum strains pPG612\u2010VP2/LP and pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP constitutively expressing the VP2 protein of vvIBDV. We found that the T7g10 enhancer efficiently upregulates VP2 expression in pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP. Orally administered, pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP exhibited significant levels of protection (87\u00B75%) against vvIBDV in chickens, indicating improved immunogenicity. Chickens in the pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP group produced higher levels of interferons (IFN\u2010\u03B3) and interleukins (IL\u20102 and IL\u20104) than those in the pPG612\u2010VP2/LP group. CD8\u002B and CD4\u002B lymphocyte counts indicated greater stimulation in the pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP group (13\u00B73 and 21\u00B70% respectively) than in the pPG612\u2010VP2/LP group (10\u00B74 and 14\u00B70% respectively).

Since its discovery in 2003, few studies have addressed bovine kobuvirus (BKoV; a species of Aichivirus B) infections. BKoV has been reported in Europe, Asia, and South America, suggesting a worldwide distribution. To investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 fecal specimens from diarrheic calves in two different Egyptian provinces (Cairo and Sharkia) were screened by RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were found positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the complete BKoV genome sequence. When compared to the only recorded BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the studied strain showed 94 amino acid (aa) substitutions through its entire polyprotein (2463 aa), one nucleotide (nt) insertion and one nt deletion in the 2B gene and 4-nt deletions in the UTRs (2 each). Additionally, five VP1 and seven 3D sequences were obtained from other samples by using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. A discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 and 3D was observed, where the Egyptian VP1 sequences were classified as a distinct cluster within the proposed lineage 1 (genotype A), which also contained strains from the UK, Brazil, and Japan. While, the 3D sequences from Cairo were related to those of Chinese strains unlike Sharkia ones that were more closer to Korean strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection and genomic characterization of BKoV in Egypt or indeed Africa.

We demonstrated the purification of virus from a mixture of virus and FBS protein, and enrichment of the virus using this novel microfluidic chip.","publish_time":"2014-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niimi, Miyako; Masuda, Taisuke; Kaihatsu, Kunihiro; Kato, Nobuo; Nakamura, Shota; Nakaya, Takaaki; Arai, Fumihito","journal":"Sens Actuators B Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b896a30f151326e3771fa5716674fb0d3d62af2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111472.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2014.04.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400514004122; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925400514004122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic analysis of infectious viruses","mixture of virus","purification of virus","spread of infectious diseases","novel microfluidic chip","microfluidic chromatography chip","generation sequencers","generation DNA sequencing techniques","hydroxyapatite particles","clinical samples","enrichment","FBS protein","global health concern","long time","micro-column","order"],"language":"en"},

The disease can result in progressive respiratory failure in adults and the mortality rate has been reported to be 8\u201315%. This infection spreads by droplet transmission and children appear to acquire SARS through close household contact exposure to infected adults. Disease severity is, however, much milder in the paediatric age group. The common laboratory findings in infected children and adolescents include lymphopaenia and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phosphokinase. Air space consolidation is commonly seen during the course of the illness although chest radiographs are normal on presentation in half of the cases. The pathophysiology of SARS appears to be related to immunological dysregulation in response to the coronavirus infection. The optimal treatment of SARS in children remains to be determined. No case fatality in infected children has been reported. The early and proper isolation of infected adults, meticulous infection control measures in the hospital setting, exhaustive contact tracing and quarantine measures are important steps in preventing the spread of the disease among health care workers and into the community. The development of a sensitive and rapid test for early diagnosis is underway. Further controlled trials are necessary to define the optimal treatment of this infection in children.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, T. F; Wong, G.W.K; Hon, K.L.E; Fok, T.

For multidomain proteins, using domains as queries depends on delineation of domain borders, which may be unknown. Thus, proteins are commonly used as queries that complicate establishing homology for similarities close to cutoff levels of statistical significance. RESULTS: In this article, we describe an iterative approach, called LAMPA, LArge Multidomain Protein Annotator, that resolves the above conundrum by gradual expansion of hit coverage of multidomain proteins through re-evaluating statistical significance of hit similarity using ever smaller queries defined at each iteration. LAMPA employs TMHMM and HHsearch for recognition of transmembrane regions and homology, respectively. We used Pfam database for annotating 2985 multidomain proteins (polyproteins) composed of \u003E1000 amino acid residues, which dominate proteomes of RNA viruses. Under strict cutoffs, LAMPA outperformed HHsearch-mediated runs using intact polyproteins as queries by three measures: number of and coverage by identified homologous regions, and number of hit Pfam profiles. Compared to HHsearch, LAMPA identified 507 extra homologous regions in 14.4% of polyproteins. This Pfam-based annotation of RNA virus polyproteins by LAMPA was also superior to RefSeq expert annotation by two measures, region number and annotated length, for 69.3% of RNA virus polyprotein entries. We rationalized the obtained results based on dependencies of HHsearch hit statistical significance for local alignment similarity score from lengths and diversities of query-target pairs in computational experiments.

The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively. For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day. But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment. The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions [Formula: see text] since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase. The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial. In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions [Formula: see text] could satisfy the aforementioned properties. By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results. They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to [Formula: see text] , in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to [Formula: see text] and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of [Formula: see text] 0.195% in the short-term period of infection. In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February. In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained. A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented. This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China. Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties.

Despite the molecular differences between viruses, an emerging theme in the study of host shutoff is that divergent viruses use similar mechanisms to enact host shutoff. Moreover, even viruses that encode few proteins often have multiple mechanisms to affect host gene expression, and we are only starting to understand how these mechanisms are integrated. In this review we discuss the multiplicity of host shutoff mechanisms used by the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus and members of the alpha- and gamma-herpesvirus subfamilies. We highlight the surprising similarities in their mechanisms of host shutoff and discuss how the different mechanisms they use may play a coordinated role in gene regulation.","publish_time":"2016-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rivas, Hembly G.; Schmaling, Summer K.; Gaglia, Marta M.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43740caefa35d11ce1aa130cd8ca86b60442b046.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4848596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27092522/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v8040102","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of host shutoff","multiplicity of host shutoff mechanisms","study of host shutoff","host gene expression","similar mechanisms","multiple mechanisms","different mechanisms","freeing host cell machinery","divergent viruses","gene regulation","viral replication","viral infections","emerging theme","shared feature","orthomyxovirus influenza","alpha","members","immune responses","molecular differences","coordinated role","gamma-herpesvirus subfamilies","surprising similarities","proteins","ability","review"],"language":"en"},

CoV-induced DMVs, however, lack conventional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi protein markers, leaving their membrane origins in question. We show that MHV co-opts the host cell machinery for COPII-independent vesicular ER export of a short-living regulator of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), EDEM1, to derive cellular membranes for replication. MHV infection causes accumulation of EDEM1 and OS-9, another short-living ER chaperone, in the DMVs. DMVs are coated with the nonlipidated LC3/Atg8 autophagy marker. Downregulation of LC3, but not inactivation of host cell autophagy, protects cells from CoV infection.

A technique that couples polymerase chain reaction to mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has recently been developed and an assay validated to identify and genotype S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the rates, risk factors, and molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in adult patients presenting to an inner-city academic emergency department. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess hospital and community risks for infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nasal swabs were analyzed by PCR/ESI-MS to identify and genotype S. aureus and CoNS. RESULTS: Of 200 patients evaluated, 59 were colonized with S. aureus; 27 of these were methicillin-resistant strains. Twenty-four of the 59 S. aureus carriers were co-colonized with a CoNS and 140 of the 200 patients were colonized exclusively with CoNS. The molecular genotypes of the 59 S. aureus strains were diverse; 21 unique molecular genotypes belonging to seven major clonal complexes were identified. Eighty-five of 200 patients carried strains with high-level mupirocin resistance. Of these eighty-five participants, 4 were colonized exclusively with S. aureus, 16 were co-colonized with S. aureus and CoNS, and 65 were colonized exclusively with CoNS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization in a random sample of patients seeking care in Emergency Department was 29.5% and 13.5%, respectively. A substantial fraction of the S. aureus-colonized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS. Determining the molecular genotype of S. aureus during intake screening may prove valuable in the future if certain molecular genotypes become associated with increased infection risk.","publish_time":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kecojevic, Aleksandar; Ranken, Ray; Ecker, David J; Massire, Christian; Sampath, Rangarajan; Blyn, Lawrence B; Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang; Rothman, Richard E; Gaydos, Charlotte A","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd28c322b33337c09ccb3d0785d8c2494efa0946.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3937163.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":["Emergency Department"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aureus-colonized patients","aureus strains","aureus colonization","aureus carriers","molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus","high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS","certain molecular genotypes","unique molecular genotypes","adult patients","molecular methods of screening","methicillin-resistant strains","random sample of patients","staphylococcal infection","increased infection risk","PCR","ESI-MS","Participants","high-level mupirocin resistance","intake screening","absence of colonization","risk factors","inner-city academic emergency department","colonizing strain type","mass spectrometry","couples polymerase chain reaction","community risks","future","hospital","information","current tests","care","structured questionnaire","coagulase-negative staphylococci","technique","presence","culture","rates","major clonal complexes","prevalence","MRSA","Nasal swabs","substantial fraction","BACKGROUND","limitation","study","CONCLUSION","assay","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here, to better understand the antigenicity and pathogenicity of this genotype, we conducted sequence analyses, cross neutralization tests, and also examined the pathogenicity of two strains, SD and SZ. Sequence analyses revealed that SD and SZ isolates belong to the QX-like IBV genotype and share high homology in their full-length genomes. Cross neutralization tests showed high cross neutralization between SD and SZ, but distant relationships with other representative strains of the classical IBV serotypes. Virus infection experiments showed that SD caused high mortality with strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity in chickens, whereas SZ caused milder lesions by comparison. This study highlights the big discrepancy in antigenicity that exists between QX-like strains and other serotypes.

The expected value of the number of condemned carcasses due to mycobacteriosis therefore would be a useful threshold to detect an outbreak, and the present study aims to develop such an expected value through time series modeling. The model was developed using eight years of inspection data (2003 to 2010) obtained at 2 abattoirs of the Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center, Japan. The resulting model was validated by comparing the predicted time-dependent values for the subsequent 2 years with the actual data for 2 years between 2011 and 2012. For the modeling, at first, periodicities were checked using Fast Fourier Transformation, and the ensemble average profiles for weekly periodicities were calculated. An Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the residual of the ensemble average on the basis of minimum Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC). The sum of the ARIMA model and the weekly ensemble average was regarded as the time-dependent expected value. During 2011 and 2012, the number of whole or partial condemned carcasses exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the predicted values 20 times. All of these events were associated with the slaughtering of pigs from three producers with the highest rate of condemnation due to mycobacteriosis.","publish_time":"2015-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"ADACHI, Yasumoto; MAKITA, Kohei","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca2fa034524ce26d06b3674b3c494635d7d5f13b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4591155.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.14-0675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["weekly ensemble average","ARIMA model","Mycobacteriosis","time-dependent expected value","ensemble average profiles","resulting model","years of inspection data","predicted time-dependent values","number of condemned carcasses","predicted values","weekly periodicities","outbreak","time series modeling","abattoirs","partial condemned carcasses","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average","meat inspections","actual data","Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center","basis of minimum Akaike\u2019s information criterion","common zoonosis","producers","confidence interval","Fast Fourier Transformation","highest rate of condemnation","AIC","Japan","veterinary authority","slaughtering of pigs","corrective actions","swine","times","useful threshold","residual","present study","sum","events"],"language":"en"},

Various hypotheses have been proposed, all involving opportunities for virus spread (for example, agricultural practices, climate changes, rainforest clearing or air travel). However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered a contributing factor to the emergence of infectious disease. In this review, we show that host nutritional status can influence not only the host response to the pathogen, but can also influence the genetic make-up of the viral genome.

The bacteria distribution was solved numerically by integrating the susceptibility constant, which was acquired from the experiments. Two types of bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis) were aerosolized and released into a 9-m ventilation duct system. Inactivation efficiencies were calculated for inlet velocities from 2 to 6.5 m/s and for various ion intensities. The efficiencies for S. marcescens and S. epidermidis were 31.53% (SD, 11.4%) and 12.17% (SD, 0.43%), respectively, with susceptibility constants of 8.67 \u00D7 10\u221211 Colony-Forming Units (CFU)/ions and 2.72 \u00D7 10\u221211 CFU/ions, respectively.

No specific drug is currently available for the effective treatment of CSFV infection; however, RNA interference (RNAi) has been applied successfully to inhibit the replication of human and other animal viruses. In this study, three effective siRNAs targeting NS3 of CSFV were selected. siNS3-2 targeting NS3 gene was chosen for further experimentation, while siN1 and siN2 targeting Npro gene, and siNS5B targeting NS5B gene describe previously. Single, double and quadruple anti-CSFV siRNA expression plasmids, with loxp sites at each end of the selectable marker genes, were constructed and analyzed using the same promoters or four different promoters, targeting Npro , NS3 and NS5B genes of CSFV. Results indicate that single or multiple siRNA expression plasmids can efficiently inhibit CSFV replication and that inhibition was markedly stronger when multiple siRNAs were expressed targeting different genes of CSFV. Since RNAi applied to anti-CSFV research, this study provides anti-CSFV methods by single and multiple siRNA expression which can target most viral isolates of different subtypes and prevent viral escape.

The many different biological pathways comprising the response to infection in lungs that are influenced by aging are complex and remain to be defined more thoroughly. Towards finding new directions in research on aging, we aimed to define biological pathways in the acute response to RSV that are affected in the lungs by aging. We therefore profiled the full transcriptome of lung tissue of mice prior to and during RSV infection both at young and old age. In the absence of RSV, we found aging to downregulate genes that are involved in constitution of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, uninfected old mice showed elevated expression of pathways that resemble injury, metabolic aberrations, and disorders mediated by functions of the immune system that were induced at young age only by an exogenous trigger like RSV. Furthermore, infection by RSV mounted stronger activation of anti-viral type-I interferon pathways at old age. Despite such exaggerated anti-viral responses, old mice showed reduced control of virus.

The etiological backgrounds of these infections remain unconfirmed in most clinical cases. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of human coronavirus infections in a series of children hospitalized with symptoms of acute respiratory tract disease in a one-year period in Slovenia. METHODS: The 664 specimens from 592 children under six years of age hospitalized at the University Children\u2019s Hospital in Ljubljana were sent for the routine laboratory detection of respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected with a direct immunofluorescence assay and human coronaviruses were detected with a modified real-time RT\u2013PCR. RESULTS: HCoV RNA was detected in 40 (6%, 95% CI: 4.3%\u20138.1%) of 664 samples. Of these specimens, 21/40 (52.5%) were identified as species HKU1, 7/40 (17.5%) as OC43, 6/40 (15%) as 229E, and 6/40 (15%) as NL63. Infection with HCoV occurred as a coinfection with one or more other viruses in most samples (70%). Of the HCoV-positive children, 70.3% had lower respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSION: The results of our study show that HCoV are frequently detected human pathogens, often associated with other respiratory viruses and acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children. An association between age and the viral load was found. The highest viral load was detected in children approximately 10 months of age.","publish_time":"2012-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jev\u0161nik, Monika; Ur\u0161i\u010D, Tina; \u017Digon, Nina; Lusa, Lara; Krivec, Uro\u0161; Petrovec, Miroslav","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac395d967bf4ce6affb506eb9cf5f1bf853e69f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3557153.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256846/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-365","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Slovenia","Ljubljana"],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory tract infections","Acute viral respiratory infections","lower respiratory tract infections","hospitalized children","HCoV-positive children","symptoms of acute respiratory tract disease","series of children","routine laboratory detection of respiratory viruses","prevalence of human coronavirus infections","HCoV RNA","human coronaviruses","human pathogens","years of age","highest viral load","months of age","study","RESULTS","specimens","samples","important cause of morbidity","Ljubljana","direct immunofluorescence assay","University Children\u2019s Hospital","mortality","modified real-time RT","year period","PCR","humans","etiological backgrounds","clinical cases","coinfection","association","Slovenia","CONCLUSION","species HKU1","METHODS","aim","OC43","NL63"],"language":"en"},

Replication of influenza vRNA occurs in the nucleus of infected cells, while progeny virions bud from the plasma membrane. However, the intracellular mechanics of vRNA assembly into progeny virions is not well understood. Here we used recent advances in microscopy to explore vRNA assembly and transport during a productive infection. We visualized four distinct vRNA segments within a single cell using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and observed that foci containing more than one vRNA segment were found at the external nuclear periphery, suggesting that vRNA segments are not exported to the cytoplasm individually. Although many cytoplasmic foci contain multiple vRNA segments, not all vRNA species are present in every focus, indicating that assembly of all eight vRNA segments does not occur prior to export from the nucleus. To extend the observations made in fixed cells, we used a virus that encodes GFP fused to the viral polymerase acidic (PA) protein (WSN PA-GFP) to explore the dynamics of vRNA assembly in live cells during a productive infection. Since WSN PA-GFP colocalizes with viral nucleoprotein and influenza vRNA segments, we used it as a surrogate for visualizing vRNA transport in 3D and at high speed by inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy. We observed cytoplasmic PA-GFP foci colocalizing and traveling together en route to the plasma membrane. Our data strongly support a model in which vRNA segments are exported from the nucleus as complexes that assemble en route to the plasma membrane through dynamic colocalization events in the cytoplasm.","publish_time":"2014-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lakdawala, Seema S.; Wu, Yicong; Wawrzusin, Peter; Kabat, Juraj; Broadbent, Andrew J.; Lamirande, Elaine W.; Fodor, Ervin; Altan-Bonnet, Nihal; Shroff, Hari; Subbarao, Kanta","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e20aef0065c509346a868a73020a7ba5862e1cd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3946384.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603687/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003971","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WSN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza vRNA segments","vRNA species","multiple vRNA segments","distinct vRNA segments","dynamics of vRNA assembly","Replication of influenza vRNA","visualizing vRNA transport","intracellular mechanics of vRNA assembly","nucleus of infected cells","plasma membrane","cytoplasmic PA-GFP foci colocalizing","WSN PA-GFP colocalizes","live cells","fixed cells","cytoplasmic foci","co-infected cells","viral nucleoprotein","Reassortment of influenza viral RNA","productive infection","viral polymerase acidic","progeny virions bud","selective-plane illumination microscopy","single cell","fluorescent","situ hybridization","high speed","dynamic colocalization events","external nuclear periphery","emergence of viruses","FISH","focus","recent advances","pandemic potential","surrogate","model","export","observations","complexes","data"],"language":"en"},

Despite international agreement to stockpile antivirals, evidence-based guidelines for their use do not exist. WHO assembled an international multidisciplinary panel to develop rapid advice for the pharmacological management of human H5N1 virus infection in the current pandemic alert period. A transparent methodological guideline process on the basis of the Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to develop evidence-based guidelines. Our development of specific recommendations for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of sporadic H5N1 infection resulted from the benefits, harms, burden, and cost of interventions in several patient and exposure groups. Overall, the quality of the underlying evidence for all recommendations was rated as very low because it was based on small case series of H5N1 patients, on extrapolation from preclinical studies, and high quality studies of seasonal influenza. A strong recommendation to treat H5N1 patients with oseltamivir was made in part because of the severity of the disease. Similarly, strong recommendations were made to use neuraminidase inhibitors as chemoprophylaxis in high-risk exposure populations. Emergence of other novel influenza A viral subtypes with pandemic potential, or changes in the pathogenicity of H5N1 virus strains, will require an update of these guidelines and WHO will be monitoring this closely.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00FCnemann, Holger J; Hill, Suzanne R; Kakad, Meetali; Bellamy, Richard; Uyeki, Timothy M; Hayden, Frederick G; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Beigel, John; Chotpitayasunondh, Tawee; Del Mar, Chris; Farrar, Jeremy; Hien, Tran Tinh; \u00D6zbay, B\u00FClent; Sugaya, Norio; Fukuda, Keiji; Shindo, Nikki; Stockman, Lauren; Vist, Gunn E; Croisier, Alice; Nagjdaliyev, Azim; Roth, Cathy; Thomson, Gail; Zucker, Howard; Oxman, Andrew D","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdd0027888c5da1a1d23710733b15c4e67747330.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106493.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309906706843; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309906706843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenicity of H5N1 virus strains","chemoprophylaxis of sporadic H5N1 infection","strong recommendations","evidence-based guidelines","pharmacological management of human H5N1 virus infection","Grading Recommendations","small case series of H5N1 patients","development of specific recommendations","novel influenza","underlying evidence","use","high quality studies of seasonal influenza","preclinical studies","pandemic potential","exposure groups","international agreement","Summary Recent spread of avian influenza","threat of human infections","high-risk exposure populations","international multidisciplinary panel","current pandemic alert period","basis","treatment","rapid advice","viral subtypes","Assessment","neuraminidase inhibitors","extrapolation","changes","Evaluation","benefits","wild birds","antivirals","cost of interventions","transparent methodological guideline process","burden","GRADE","harms","approach","poultry","Emergence","update","oseltamivir","severity","disease"],"language":"en"},

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (1). That same day, the first confirmed COVID-19-associated fatality occurred in New York City (NYC). To identify confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, defined as those occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on March 13, 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated a daily match between all deaths reported to the DOHMH electronic vital registry system (eVital) (2) and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Deaths for which COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or an equivalent term is listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death, but that do not have laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 are classified as probable COVID-19-associated deaths. As of May 2, a total of 13,831 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, and 5,048 probable COVID-19-associated deaths were recorded in NYC (3). Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths might not include deaths among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths also does not include deaths that are not directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death. Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5). Reporting of excess deaths might provide a more accurate measure of the impact of the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"MMWR.

They belong to the family Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Pneumovirinae) and is responsible for acute respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. We designed and tested a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) as a cost-effective alternative to real-time PCR and cell culture based detection for HMPV and HRSV. The newly developed PCR was used to screen nasal/throat swab samples from 356 patients with suspected acute respiratory infection attending the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The method was compared with a commercially available kit employing real time PCR, for its sensitivity and specificity. 53 (14.9 %) samples were positive for at least one tested pathogen by mRT-PCR. All except one among the positive samples showed similar pathogen profile when tested using real time PCR. 8 (15.1 %) among these 53 were positive for HRSVA, 33 (62.3 %) positive for HRSVB and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for HMPV. 17 (32.7 %) samples showed co-infections in them. Sensitivity and specificity of the mRT-PCR was comparable to that of the commercial kit. Our findings indicate that this newly developed mRT-PCR can be used as a cost-effective alternative for laboratory diagnosis of HMPV/HRSV infection and will significantly reduce diagnostic costs for these viruses in clinical settings.

However, little is known about microbial changes during cryptosporidiosis, one of the most important diarrhoeal diseases caused by protozoa in cattle. In this study, alterations in the faecal microbiota of neonatal calves as a result of Cryptosporidium parvum infection were investigated on a C. parvum-positive farm. Comparisons were made among groups of C. parvum-infected, rotavirus-infected, and the pathogen-negative calves. A specific increase in the abundance of Fusobacterium was observed in the faecal microbiota of C. parvum-infected animals.

Moreover, the specific increase of Fusobacterium appeared to be a universal feature of C. parvum infection, since neonatal calves from geographically separated areas showed the same result.

This generated a remarkable race to find solutions for the prevention, treatment and management of this disease which is involving a large amount of people. Every day, new Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solutions regarding personal protective equipment and medical devices populate social media feeds. Many companies (e.g., automotive or textile) are converting their traditional production to manufacture the most needed equipment (e.g., respirators, face shields, ventilators etc.). In this chaotic scenario, policy makers, international and national standards bodies, along with the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientific societies are making a joint effort to increase global awareness and knowledge about the importance of respecting the relevant requirements to guarantee appropriate quality and safety for patients and healthcare workers. Nonetheless, ordinary procedures for testing and certification are currently questioned and empowered with fast-track pathways in order to speed-up the deployment of new solutions for COVID-19. This paper shares critical reflections on the current regulatory framework for the certification of personal protective equipment. We hope that these reflections may help readers in navigating the framework of regulations, norms and international standards relevant for key personal protective equipment, sharing a subset of tests that should be deemed essential even in a period of crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pecchia, Leandro; Piaggio, Davide; Maccaro, Alessia; Formisano, Claudio; Iadanza, Ernesto","journal":"Health Technol (Berl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/744604511c3713a4223b4c3555f65fc41a36dde8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195610.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12553-020-00429-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["certification of personal protective equipment","key personal protective equipment","needed equipment","international standards relevant","deployment of new solutions","COVID","national standards bodies","national healthcare systems","relevant requirements","framework of regulations","new Do-It-Yourself","healthcare workers","critical reflections","current regulatory framework","World Health Organization","medical devices","unprecedented request","beds","DIY","policy makers","intensive care unit","ICU","safety","norms","Europe conditions typical of low","joint effort","appropriate quality","significant stress test","global awareness","importance","patients","respirators","social media feeds","speed-up","scientific societies","resources settings","textile","knowledge","supply-chain disruption","order","chaotic scenario","treatment","prevention","services","traditional production","face shields","subset of tests","disease","management","ventilators","pathways","ordinary procedures","testing","paper","day","readers","remarkable race"],"language":"en"},

Inhibition of PLA2G4A activity reduced core protein abundance at lipid droplets, core envelopment and secretion of particles.

There is a dearth of research about the role of viral pathogens in the etiology of respiratory infections in military trainees in Iran. Hence, we aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology and clinical symptoms of respiratory viruses among this population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 400 military trainees with symptoms of respiratory infection, referred to the military medical clinic center in the basic military training camp of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nucleic acid extraction from the throat or nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed by an automated extraction system. The extracts were then analyzed by the CLART\u00AE PneumoVir array system for the detection of respiratory viruses. Results: All military trainees were male, aged between 18 and 57 years (mean: 21.69 years). Sore throat (75.5%), rhinorrhea (63.2%), cough (59.2%), fever (59.2%), and nasal congestion (50.5%) were amongst the most common symptoms. Overall, viral pathogens were detected in a total count of 124 (31%). The most commonly detected viruses were rhinovirus (7.2%), respiratory syncytial virus A (7.2%) and influenza B virus (6%). Conclusion: This study was an important first step for understanding the etiological role of viral pathogens in respiratory infection among military trainees population in Iran. Our results indicated that rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A and influenza B virus are important viral pathogens causing respiratory infection in military trainees, respectively. However, further multi-center studies with larger sample size are strongly recommended to confirm our findings.","publish_time":"2019-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tavakoli, Ahmad; Karbalaie Niya, Mohammad Hadi; Bokharaei-Salim, Farah; Farahmand, Mohammad; Izadi, Morteza; Dorostkar, Ruhollah; Keyvani, Hossein","journal":"Med J Islam Repub Iran","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6708098.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456964/; https://doi.org/10.34171/mjiri.33.40","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["symptoms of respiratory infection","respiratory syncytial virus","military trainees population","Military populations","detection of respiratory viruses","etiology of respiratory infections","clinical symptoms of respiratory viruses","important viral pathogens","military medical clinic center","basic military training camp","etiological role of viral pathogens","influenza B virus","detected viruses","rhinovirus","common symptoms","Results","years","automated extraction system","Islamic Republic of Iran","cross-sectional study","Sore throat","multi-center studies","PneumoVir array system","Nucleic acid extraction","General Staff","Armed Forces","larger sample size","nasopharyngeal swab samples","molecular epidemiology","CLART","step","Background","dearth of research","male","total count","cough","rhinorrhea","Methods","mean","Conclusion","nasal congestion","fever","extracts","findings"],"language":"en"},

The current available therapies are ineffective in improving the quality of life and reducing mortality rates. There exists a clear unmet medical need to treat this disease, which necessitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets/agents for safe and successful therapy. An altered renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated as a causative factor in the pathogenesis of PAH. Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the RAS, can exert deleterious effects on the pulmonary vasculature resulting in vasoconstriction, proliferation and inflammation, all of which contribute to PAH development. Recently, a new member of the RAS, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was discovered. This enzyme functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system by metabolizing Angiotensin II to a putative protective peptide, Angiotensin-(1-7). ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the lung tissue and emerging evidence suggests a beneficial role for this enzyme against lung diseases. In this review, we focus on ACE2 in relation to pulmonary hypertension and provide proof of principle for its therapeutic role in PAH.","publish_time":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shenoy, Vinayak; Qi, Yanfei; Katovich, Michael J; Raizada, Mohan K","journal":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7518b826f53c63fba15d5870a80dee4ba8efe1dd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2c8a8461d046eeda9f76e88e5db50af4af949e22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3075309.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3075309?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471489210001797; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coph.2010.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471489210001797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21215698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RAS","ACE2","therapeutic role","pulmonary hypertension","altered renin-angiotensin system","pathogenesis of PAH","PAH development","chronic lung disease","pulmonary vasculature","lung tissue","lung diseases","Pulmonary arterial hypertension","enzyme functions","limited therapeutic options","beneficial role","discovery of novel therapeutic targets","key effector peptide","putative protective peptide","agents","poor diagnosis","proof of principle","emerging evidence","negative regulator","quality of life","vasoconstriction","proliferation","deleterious effects","relation","clear unmet medical need","successful therapy","current available therapies","mortality rates","causative factor","new member","inflammation","review"],"language":"en"},

Although RSV epidemics generally occur between October and April, the size and timing vary across epidemic seasons and are difficult to predict accurately. Prediction of epidemic characteristics would support management of resources and treatment. METHODS: The goals of this research were to examine the empirical relationships among early exponential growth rate, total epidemic size, and timing, and the utility of specific parameters in compartmental models of transmission in accounting for variation among seasonal RSV epidemic curves. RSV testing data from Primary Children\u0027s Medical Center were collected on children under two years of age (July 2001-June 2008). Simple linear regression was used explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length) and exponential growth calculated from four weeks of daily case data. A compartmental model of transmission was fit to the data and parameter estimated used to help describe the variation among seasonal RSV epidemic curves. RESULTS: The regression results indicated that exponential growth was correlated to epidemic characteristics. The transmission modeling results indicated that start time for the epidemic and the transmission parameter co-varied with the epidemic season. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions were that exponential growth was somewhat empirically related to seasonal epidemic characteristics and that variation in epidemic start date as well as the transmission parameter over epidemic years could explain variation in seasonal epidemic size. These relationships are useful for public health, health care providers, and infectious disease researchers.","publish_time":"2011-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leecaster, Molly; Gesteland, Per; Greene, Tom; Walton, Nephi; Gundlapalli, Adi; Rolfs, Robert; Byington, Carrie; Samore, Matthew","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e7571bccf8e71340eae54a7254aa136d0cbbcb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3094225.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21510889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","Primary Children\u0027s Medical Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic years","seasonal epidemic characteristics","epidemic seasons","epidemic length","seasonal epidemic size","seasonal RSV epidemic curves","total epidemic size","final epidemic size","Prediction of epidemic characteristics","epidemic start date","variation","RSV epidemics","RSV testing data","transmission modeling results","compartmental models of transmission","compartmental model of transmission","early exponential growth rate","transmission parameter co-varied","regression results","health care providers","public health","Seasonal respiratory syncytial virus","timing","CONCLUSIONS","increased health care costs","empirical relationships","weeks of daily case data","years of age","Simple linear regression","significant pediatric morbidity","accounting","Primary Children\u0027s Medical Center","temperate climates","days","utility of specific parameters","time","infectious disease researchers","management of resources","BACKGROUND","METHODS","goals","treatment"],"language":"en"},

The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits HIV and SIV infection at the stage of host cell entry. However, it is still unclear to what extent the antiviral activity of IFITM3 observed in cell culture translates into inhibition of HIV/SIV spread in the infected host. We have shown previously that although rhIFITM3 inhibits SIV entry into cultured cells, polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 gene are not strongly associated with viral load or disease progression in SIV infected macaques. Here, we examined whether rhIFITM3(2), which is closely related to rhIFITM3 at the sequence level, exerts antiviral activity and whether polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene impact the course of SIV infection. We show that expression of rhIFITM3(2) is interferon-inducible and inhibits SIV entry into cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to rhIFITM3. We further report the identification of 19 polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene. However, analysis of a well characterized cohort of SIV infected macaques revealed that none of the polymorphisms had a significant impact upon the course of SIV infection. These results and our previous work suggest that polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) genes do not strongly modulate the course of SIV infection in macaques.","publish_time":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Winkler, Michael; G\u00E4rtner, Sabine; Markus, Lara; Hoffmann, Markus; Nehlmeier, Inga; Krawczak, Michael; Sauermann, Ulrike; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/315f0a94d6ac0655e0e5defec4f9526641c76037.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6827983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827983/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","HIV/SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIV entry","rhIFITM3 gene","course of SIV infection","expression of rhIFITM3","polymorphisms","characterized cohort of SIV infected macaques","infection of humans","experimental infection of rhesus macaques","gene impact","infected host","antiviral activity of IFITM3","inhibition of HIV","stage of host cell entry","human immunodeficiency virus","simian immunodeficiency virus","cultured cells","cell culture","significant impact","interferon-inducible","important model","disease progression","viral load","extent","sequence level","transmembrane protein","previous work","reduced efficiency","genes","results","analysis","identification"],"language":"en"},

Although graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease is well recognized as one of the adverse effects of DLI, there are limited reports on noninfectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs) after DLI. CASE REPORT: A 55\u2010year\u2010old woman with acute myeloid leukemia received DLI for conversion from recipient predominant to complete donor chimerism on Day \u002B193 after allogeneic HSCT. Eight weeks later, she complained of dyspnea with fever; chest computed tomography revealed diffuse, bilateral, ground glass opacity and reticular appearance. She was diagnosed as having NIPC based on serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) findings. She was successfully treated with prednisolone (PSL) and completely recovered. DISCUSSION: We analyzed the cell profile from the BALF and 27 cytokines and chemokines in the serum using the Bio\u2010Plex platform. The cells consisted of recipient predominant macrophages and T cells. The serum cytokine and chemokine profile showed significant elevation of interleukin (IL)\u22121\u03B2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03B1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u22121\u03B1, and MIP\u20101\u03B2, which declined with the improvement of symptoms after initiation of PSL treatment. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory effectors by recipient cells, rather than allogeneic responses by donor cells, played an important role in the pathogenesis of NIPCs after DLI in the present case.","publish_time":"2015-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishie, Miyuki; Fujii, Nobuharu; Mimura, Yusuke; Asano, Takeru; Mimura\u2010Kimura, Yuka; Aoe, Keisuke; Aoe, Michinori; Nakashima, Hiromi; Fujiwara, Hideaki; Nishimori, Hisakazu; Matsuoka, Ken\u2010Ichi; Kondo, Eisei; Maeda, Yoshinobu; Tanimoto, Mitsune","journal":"Transfusion","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b89dac7301209d0d924b9ce1f8973513b2bc789a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449992/; https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.13283","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DLI","NIPC","BALF","PSL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recipient cells","donor cells","adverse effects of DLI","complete donor chimerism","recipient predominant macrophages","allogeneic responses","serum cytokine","cell profile","BALF","allogeneic HSCT","MIP","Donor lymphocyte infusion","initiation of PSL treatment","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","mixed chimerism","chemokine profile","pathogenesis of NIPCs","Inflammatory effectors","CASE REPORT","present case","macrophage inflammatory protein","treatment of hematologic malignancy relapse","conversion","ground glass opacity","chest computed tomography","acute myeloid leukemia","significant elevation of interleukin","year\u2010old woman","limited reports","tumor necrosis factor","Day","noninfectious pulmonary complications","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","dyspnea","fever","important role","reticular appearance","findings","Bio","improvement of symptoms","chemokines","cytokines","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Plex platform","graft","host disease","DISCUSSION","weeks","prednisolone"],"language":"en"},

Tissue culture-adapted type I FCoV shows reduced FIP induction in experimental infections, which complicates the understanding of FIP pathogenesis caused by type I FCoV. We previously found that the type I FCoV strain C3663 efficiently induces FIP in specific-pathogen-free cats through the naturally infectious route. In this study, we employed a bacterial artificial chromosome-based reverse genetics system to gain more insights into FIP caused by the C3633 strain. We successfully generated recombinant virus (rC3663) from Fcwf-4 cells transfected with infectious cDNA that showed growth kinetics similar to those shown by the parental virus. Next, we constructed a reporter C3663 virus carrying the nanoluciferase (Nluc) gene to measure viral replication with high sensitivity. The inhibitory effects of different compounds against rC3663-Nluc could be measured within 24 h postinfection. Furthermore, we found that A72 cells derived from canine fibroblasts permitted FCoV replication without apparent cytopathic effects. Thus, our reporter virus is useful for uncovering the infectivity of type I FCoV in different cell lines, including canine-derived cells. Surprisingly, we uncovered aberrant viral RNA transcription of rC3663 in A72 cells. Overall, we succeeded in obtaining infectious cDNA clones derived from type I FCoV that retained its virulence. Our recombinant FCoVs are powerful tools for increasing our understanding of the viral life cycle and pathogenesis of FIP-inducing type I FCoV. IMPORTANCE Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is one of the most significant coronaviruses, because this virus induces feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is a lethal disease in cats. Tissue culture-adapted type I FCoV often loses pathogenicity, which complicates research on type I FCoV-induced feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Since we previously found that type I FCoV strain C3663 efficiently induces FIP in specific-pathogen-free cats, we established a reverse genetics system for the C3663 strain to obtain recombinant viruses in the present study. By using a reporter C3663 virus, we were able to examine the inhibitory effect of 68 compounds on C3663 replication in Fcwf-4 cells and infectivity in a canine-derived cell line. Interestingly, one canine cell line, A72, permitted FCoV replication but with low efficiency and aberrant viral gene expression.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terada, Yutaka; Kuroda, Yudai; Morikawa, Shigeru; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Maeda, Ken; Kamitani, Wataru","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2e84eaaafdad0141daedef80cc2a242e3c27709.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6803248.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375588/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01208-19; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/21/e01208-19.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCoV replication","FCoV strain C3663","pathogenesis of FIP","infectivity of type","C3663 replication","C3663 strain","reporter C3663 virus","Feline infectious peritonitis","reporter virus","understanding of FIP pathogenesis","canine-derived cells","viral replication","A72 cells","infectious route","Tissue culture-adapted type","reduced FIP induction","parental virus","infectious cDNA clones","canine-derived cell line","free cats","canine cell line","important infectious diseases","IMPORTANCE Feline coronavirus","canine fibroblasts","rC3663-Nluc","C3633 strain","aberrant viral gene expression","aberrant viral RNA transcription of rC3663","reverse genetics system","different cell lines","viral life cycle","specific-pathogen","Fcwf","inhibitory effects of different compounds","recombinant viruses","recombinant FCoVs","present study","apparent cytopathic effects","low efficiency","experimental infections","bacterial artificial chromosome","insights","nanoluciferase","pathogenicity","growth kinetics similar","powerful tools","high sensitivity","research","lethal disease","significant coronaviruses","virulence","h postinfection"],"language":"en"},

The primer set was adapted by many researchers worldwide and has already contributed to the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this rapidly spreading viral disease. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set amplifies all desired 98 PCR amplicons with fairly small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we also observed an acute drop of reads derived from some amplicons especially amplicon 18 and 76 in \u201Cpool 2\u201D as a sample\u2019s viral load decreases. We suspected this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers targeting those two amplicons. Indeed, replacement of just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, to a newly designed primer resulted in a drastic improvement of coverages at both regions targeted by the amplicons 18 and 76. Given this result, we further replaced four primers in \u201Cpool 1\u201D with each respective alternative. These modifications also improved coverage in eight amplicons particularly in samples with low viral load. The results of our experiments clearly indicate that primer dimer formation is one critical cause of coverage bias in ARTIC protocol. Importantly, some of the problematic primers are detectable by observing primer dimers in raw NGS sequence reads and replacing them with alternatives as shown in this study. We expect a continuous improvement of the ARTIC primer set will extend the limit for completion of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to samples with lower viral load, that supports better genomic epidemiology and mitigation of spread of this pathogen.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Itokawa, Kentaro; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Hashino, Masanori; Tanaka, Rina; Kuroda, Makoto","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7666fe0a9bdf17bffd4f6cca7bf1e558fddeca61.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.985150","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","NGS","ARTIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARTIC primer set","primer dimers","designed primer","primer dimer formation","multiplexed PCR primer","low viral load","PCR amplicons","high viral load","lower viral load","viral disease","sample\u2019s viral load decreases","ARTIC protocol","problematic primers","clinical samples","ARTIC Network","SARS-CoV","low coverage issue","pool","critical cause of coverage bias","prompt genome epidemiology","genome analysis","continuous improvement","completion of SARS","genomic epidemiology","small amplification bias","drastic improvement of coverages","acute drop of reads","genomes","limit","novel coronavirus","raw NGS sequence","regions","experiments","mitigation","group of biologists","RIGHT","great performance","start of COVID","epidemics","alternatives","respective alternative","nCoV","modifications","researchers","study","pathogen","results","replacement"],"language":"en"},

However, early bunyavirus-host cell interactions and entry mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. Investigating Uukuniemi virus, a bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus, we found that virus attachment to the cell surface was specific but inefficient, with 25% of bound viruses being endocytosed within 10 min, mainly via noncoated vesicles. The viruses entered Rab5a\u002B early endosomes and, subsequently, Rab7a\u002B and LAMP-1\u002B late endosomes. Acid-activated penetration, occurring 20\u201340 min after internalization, required maturation of early to late endosomes. The pH threshold for viral membrane fusion was 5.4, and entry was sensitive to temperatures below 25\u00B0C. Together, our results indicate that Uukuniemi virus penetrates host cells by acid-activated membrane fusion from late endosomal compartments. This study also highlights the importance of the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway in facilitating entry of late-penetrating viruses.","publish_time":"2010-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lozach, Pierre-Yves; Mancini, Roberta; Bitto, David; Meier, Roger; Oestereich, Lisa; \u00D6verby, Anna K.; Pettersson, Ralf F.; Helenius, Ari","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeb46db3f7d5b70f7a083868fb6b17006a213493.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ddaeb8a2a465891dfd7044a5db744359a1a53417.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172475.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542252/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312810001708; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312810001708; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2010.05.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["late endosomes","early endosomes","facilitating entry of late","Uukuniemi virus","penetrating viruses","bound viruses","acid-activated membrane fusion","entry mechanisms","early bunyavirus-host cell interactions","virus attachment","late endosomal compartments","maturation of early","viral membrane fusion","Acid-activated penetration","large family of enveloped animal viruses","host cells","cell surface","endocytic pathway","members","degradative branch","pH threshold","genus Phlebovirus","importance","Bunyaviridae","Rab7a","LAMP","results","Rab5a","serious diseases","temperatures","internalization","noncoated vesicles","study"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to compare the emotional state, somatic responses, sleep quality, and behavior of people in Hubei Province with non-endemic provinces in China during two weeks in February 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: Questionnaires were completed by 939 individuals (357 men; 582 women), including 33 from Hubei and 906 from non-endemic provinces. The Stress Response Questionnaire (SRQ) determined the emotional state, somatic responses, and behavior. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration of sleep and sleep quality. RESULTS: There were 939 study participants, aged 18\u201324 years (35.89%) and 25\u201339 years (35.57%); 65.92% were university students. During a two week period in February 2020, the emotional state and behavior of participants in Hubei improved, but the quality of sleep did not. Health workers and business people became increasingly anxious, but other professionals became less anxious. The data showed that most people in Hubei Province developed a more positive attitude regarding their risk of infection and the chances of surviving the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: During a two-week period, front-line health workers and people in Hubei Province became less anxious about the COVID-19 epidemic, but sleep quality did not improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine. Therefore, health education should be combined with psychological counseling for vulnerable individuals.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Shuai; Liao, Zhenxin; Huang, Haojie; Jiang, Boyue; Zhang, Xueyan; Wang, Yingwen; Zhao, Mingyi","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d4030df933dd2d3120e901932b085e54ba2abbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177041.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.923767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["quality of sleep","Hubei Province","behavior of people","Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index","quality of life","duration of sleep","emotional state","COVID","business people","behavior of participants","front-line health workers","somatic responses","non-endemic provinces","China","health education","study participants","years","two-week period","vulnerable individuals","periods of population quarantine","SRQ","epidemics","positive attitude","psychological counseling","risk of infection","PSQI","levels of anxiety","Stress Response Questionnaire","public awareness","Questionnaires","chances","height","weeks","women","MATERIAL","METHODS","isolation","CONCLUSIONS","coronavirus disease","RESULTS","professionals","data","university students","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Antibiotics are often inappropriately used for the treatment of pharyngitis, which can contribute to antimicrobial resistance, therefore non-antibiotic treatments which have broad antiseptic effects may be more appropriate. Amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) are present in some antiseptic lozenges and have established benefits in providing symptomatic relief and some in vitro antiviral action. METHODS: Seven bacterial species associated with pharyngitis, namely Streptococcus pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenza, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and Staphylococcus aureus, were exposed to an AMC/DCBA lozenge dissolved in artificial saliva. In vitro bactericidal activity was measured as a log reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs). RESULTS: Bactericidal activity was recorded against all organisms after 1 minute. Greater than 3 log(10) reductions in CFUs were observed at 1 minute for S. pyogenes (log(10) reduction CFU/mL \u00B1 SD, 5.7\u00B10.1), H. influenza (6.1\u00B10.1), A. haemolyticum (6.5\u00B10.0) and F. necrophorum (6.5\u00B10.0), at 5 minutes for S. dysgalactiae (6.3\u00B10.0) and M. catarrhalis (5.0\u00B10.9) and at 10 minutes for S. aureus (3.5\u00B10.1). CONCLUSION: An AMC/DCBA lozenge demonstrated a greater than 99.9% reduction in CFUs against all tested species within 10 minutes, which is consistent with the time a lozenge remains in the mouth. Patients with uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis may benefit from the antibacterial action of antiseptic AMC/DCBA lozenges. Furthermore, AMC/DCBA lozenges may be more relevant and appropriate than antibiotics for pharyngitis associated with a self-limiting viral URTI.","publish_time":"2018-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matthews, Derek; Atkinson, Robert; Shephard, Adrian","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/645a3eaa114cc4a4827d02c0ef31b8a19c45b802.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6276617.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30568479/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s184406","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Moraxella","S. aureus"],"organizations":["AMC/DCBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DCBA lozenges","antiseptic lozenges","log reduction","treatment of pharyngitis","CFUs","minutes","antibacterial action of antiseptic AMC","uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis","Streptococcus pyogenes","reduction CFU","bacterial species","bactericidal activity","Antibiotics","broad antiseptic effects","self-limiting viral URTI","Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis","Moraxella catarrhalis","Haemophilus influenza","Fusobacterium necrophorum","Arcanobacterium haemolyticum","antiviral action","tested species","Staphylococcus aureus","self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection","non-antibiotic treatments","symptoms","antimicrobial resistance","symptomatic relief","benefits","dichlorobenzyl alcohol","colony","units","artificial saliva","time","organisms","Patients","CONCLUSION","sore throat","mouth","SD","RESULTS","METHODS","reductions","PURPOSE","Amylmetacresol"],"language":"en"},

Without ACE2 acting as a guardian to inactivate the ligands of B1R, the lung environment is prone for local vascular leakage leading to angioedema. Here, we hypothesize that a kinin-dependent local lung angioedema via B1R and eventually B2R is an important feature of COVID-19.

Wild rats abundant in urban environments may transmit diseases to humans and other animals, including laboratory rodents used for biomedical research in research facilities, possibly compromising research data. In order to gather information about the various diseases present around such facilities, it is important to conduct routine surveillance of wild rodents in the area. In this pilot study, we surveyed 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts for 19 microorganisms. Information gained from such surveillance data would be beneficial in assessing regional public health risks and when implementing routine laboratory rodent health monitoring protocols. ABSTRACT: A pilot seroprevalence study was conducted to document exposure to selected pathogens in wild rats inhabiting the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Serum samples collected from 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) were tested for the presence of antibodies to various rodent pathogens using a rat MFI2 serology panel. The samples were positive for cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (13/22; 59.1%), Clostridium piliforme (4/22; 18.2%), Mycoplasma pulmonis (4/22; 18.2%), Pneumocystis carinii (1/22; 4.5%), mouse adenovirus type 2 (16/22; 72.7%), Kilham rat virus (15/22; 68.2%), reovirus type 3 (9/22; 40.9%), rat parvovirus (4/22; 18.2%), rat minute virus (4/22; 18.2%), rat theilovirus (2/22; 9.1%), and infectious diarrhea of infant rats strain of group B rotavirus (rat rotavirus) (1/22; 4.5%). This study provides the first evidence of exposure to various rodent pathogens in wild rats on the island of St. Kitts. Periodic pathogen surveillance in the wild rat population would be beneficial in assessing potential regional zoonotic risks as well as in enhancing the current knowledge when implementing routine animal health monitoring protocols in facilities with laboratory rodent colonies.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boey, Kenneth; Shiokawa, Kanae; Avsaroglu, Harutyun; Rajeev, Sreekumari","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3442b139e80c8351c89a9398709090db63edb8fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6562389.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083284/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9050228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Information"],"locations":["Caribbean","St. Kitts"],"keyphrases":["Rattus rattus","wild rat population","Wild rats abundant","rat rotavirus","routine surveillance of wild rodents","Rattus norvegicus","rat parvovirus","rat theilovirus","various rodent pathogens","Kilham rat virus","rat minute virus","laboratory rodents","research facilities","Kitts","routine laboratory rodent health monitoring protocols","laboratory rodent colonies","Caribbean island of","research data","surveillance data","rat MFI2 serology panel","pilot study","various diseases present","infectious diarrhea of infant rats","routine animal health monitoring protocols","selected pathogens","regional public health risks","biomedical research","role of rodents","pilot seroprevalence study","information","Periodic pathogen surveillance","document exposure","evidence of exposure","potential regional zoonotic risks","Serum samples","reovirus type","group B rotavirus","mouse adenovirus type","urban environments","humans","current knowledge","presence of antibodies","cilia","animals","respiratory bacillus","SIMPLE SUMMARY","ABSTRACT","transmission","area","order","microorganisms","Clostridium piliforme","Mycoplasma pulmonis","Pneumocystis carinii"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 is abundant in the 43 lungs, heart, blood vessels, tests, brain and intestine(2, 3), and is responsible for the production 44 of Angiotensin 1-7, which exerts vasodilatory, natriuretic/diuretic, anti-inflammatory and 45 antifibrotic effects via the Mas receptor (2, 4). In the lung, the organ most vulnerable to SARS- 46 CoV-2 infection in the ongoing current pandemic, ACE2 is localized to type II (AT2), and to a 47 lesser extent to type I (AT1) alveolar cells (4). Remarkably, AT2 express many genes that are 48 profoundly involved in the reproduction and transmission of the virus (5). The kidney and testis, 49 two additional organs susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 also express high immunoreactivity to ACE2(2, 50 3), which therefore can be reasonably hypothesized as a candidate for possible involvement in 51 the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, which also encompass acute kidney injury and 52 impaired fertility (6-8) (Fig 1). Furthermore, preliminary available data from infected patients 53 illustrate that patients treated with angiotensin-II inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin receptor 54 blockers (ARBs) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exhibit severe symptoms 55 with a higher mortality rate as compared to non-user counterparts (6-8). Of notable relevance 56 is the demonstration that that ACE-I, ARBS and even mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockers 57 remarkably augment the expression of ACE-2 both in diabetic patients (6, 9) and animals with 58 experimental heart failure (10). Similarly, NSAIDs, non-selectively block cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 59 and COX-2, both enzymes being abundant in kidney tissue and well-established for the role in 60 beneficial vasodilatory and natriuretic responses, as the case with ACE2.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abassi, Zaid A.; Skorecki, Karl; Heyman, Samuel Noam; Kinaneh, Safa; Armaly, Zaher","journal":"Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200872.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00097.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207983/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mas"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","ACE2","angiotensin receptor","clinical manifestations of SARS","ARBs","blockers","infected patients","kidney tissue","NSAIDs","diabetic patients","mineralocorticoid receptor","Mas receptor","expression of ACE","COX","AT2","non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","non-user counterparts","acute kidney injury","natriuretic responses","host cells","alveolar cells","experimental heart failure","recent preceding epidemic causing viral family member","severe symptoms","role","higher mortality rate","blood vessels","additional organs susceptible","tests","animals","antifibrotic effects","diuretic","lungs","infection","ongoing current pandemic","possible involvement","brain","AT1","impaired fertility","preliminary available data","testis","receptors","enzymes","MR","intestine","outbreak","demonstration","case","cyclooxygenase","high immunoreactivity","inhibitors","reproduction","transmission","southeastern China","notable relevance","lesser extent","candidate","Coronavirus","genes","Fig"],"language":"en"},

Employment of these units in the United States and Western Europe resulted in a significant decrease in mortality compared to traditional management in field settings. Moreover, this employment appeared to significantly lessen the risk of nosocomial transmission of disease; no secondary cases occurred among healthcare workers in these units. While many now accept the wisdom of utilizing HLCC units and principles in the management of EVD (and, presumably, of other transmissible and highly hazardous viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as those caused by Marburg and Lassa viruses), no consensus exists regarding additional diseases that might warrant HLCC. We propose here a construct designed to make such determinations for existing and newly discovered diseases. The construct examines infectivity (as measured by the infectious dose needed to infect 50% of a given population (ID(50))), communicability (as measured by the reproductive number (R(0))), and hazard (as measured by morbidity and mortality).

Person-to-person transmission is evident in outbreaks involving household and hospital contacts. Effective antivirals are urgently needed. Methods We used small compound-based forward chemical genetics to screen a chemical library of 1280 known drugs against influenza A virus in Biosafety Level-2 laboratory. We then assessed the anti-MERS-CoV activities of the identified compounds and of interferons, nelfinavir, and lopinavir because of their reported anti-coronavirus activities in terms of cytopathic effect inhibition, viral yield reduction, and plaque reduction assays in Biosafety Level-3 laboratory. Results Ten compounds were identified as primary hits in high-throughput screening. Only mycophenolic acid exhibited low EC50 and high selectivity index. Additionally, ribavirin and interferons also exhibited in-vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity. The serum concentrations achievable at therapeutic doses of mycophenolic acid and interferon-\u03B21b were 60\u2013300 and 3\u20134 times higher than the concentrations at which in-vitro anti-MERS-CoV activities were demonstrated, whereas that of ribavirin was \u223C2 times lower.

Under the appropriate conditions, some mice develop clinically apparent demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks later, with virus always present in the spinal cord. To determine the pathway by which virus reaches the cord, brains and spinal cords of infected, asymptomatic mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Viral RNA was always detected in the anterior part of the upper spinal cord. A similar analysis of mice with the recent onset of hindlimb weakness showed that viral RNA was detected in the same location. The results suggest that MHV is transported to the spinal cord via well-defined neuroanatomic pathways and that viral amplification with resultant clinical disease occurs from this site of persistence in the anterior spinal cord. This process of viral amplification may involve the generation of viral variants as has been described for MHV-infected rats. No major changes in viral RNA or protein could be detected when MHV isolated from mice with hindlimb paralysis was analyzed. The data suggest that the generation of viral variants is not important in the pathogenesis of the late onset neurological disease induced by MHV in mice.","publish_time":"1990-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, Stanley; Jacobsen, Gary; Olson, Ann Louise; Afifi, Adel","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/241f6579fd5bb86771d4367d152f88282dfca4a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229090426R; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229090426R","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral RNA","anterior spinal cord","upper spinal cord","generation of viral variants","process of viral amplification","asymptomatic mice","spinal cords of infected","MHV-infected rats","similar analysis of mice","mouse hepatitis virus","late onset neurological disease","recent onset of hindlimb weakness","hindlimb paralysis","resultant clinical disease","gains entry","well-defined neuroanatomic pathways","pathogenesis","central nervous system","intranasal inoculation","site of persistence","CNS","weeks","protein","brains","apparent demyelinating encephalomyelitis","Abstract","major changes","trigeminal nerves","appropriate conditions","situ hybridization","data","location","results"],"language":"en"},

Integrative solutions benefit experimenters by eliminating potential biases that come with single omic analysis. We have developed the methods needed to explore whether a relationship exists between co-expression network models built from transcriptomic and proteomic data types, and whether this relationship can be used to improve the disease signature discovery process. A na\u00EFve, correlation based method is utilized for comparison. Using publicly available infectious disease time series data, we analyzed the related co-expression structure of the transcriptome and proteome in response to SARS-CoV infection in mice. Transcript and peptide expression data was filtered using quality scores and subset by taking the intersection on mapped Entrez IDs. Using this data set, independent co-expression networks were built. The networks were integrated by constructing a bipartite module graph based on module member overlap, module summary correlation, and correlation to phenotypes of interest. Compared to the module level results, the na\u00EFve approach is hindered by a lack of correlation across data types, less significant enrichment results, and little functional overlap across data types. Our module graph approach avoids these problems, resulting in an integrated omic signature of disease progression, which allows prioritization across data types for down-stream experiment planning. Integrated modules exhibited related functional enrichments and could suggest novel interactions in response to infection. These disease and platform-independent methods can be used to realize the full potential of multi-omic network signatures.

It is thought that, similar to other RNA viruses, high mutation rates allow NoVs to evolve fast and to undergo rapid immune escape at the population level. However, the rate and spectrum of spontaneous mutations of human NoVs have not been quantified previously. Here, we analyzed the intra-patient diversity of the NoV capsid by carrying out RT-PCR and ultra-deep sequencing with 100,000-fold coverage of 16 stool samples from symptomatic patients. This revealed the presence of low-frequency sequences carrying large numbers of U-to-C or A-to-G base transitions, suggesting a role for hyper-mutation in NoV diversity. To more directly test for hyper-mutation, we performed transfection assays in which the production of mutations was restricted to a single cell infection cycle. This confirmed the presence of sequences with multiple U-to-C/A-to-G transitions, and suggested that hyper-mutation contributed a large fraction of the total NoV spontaneous mutation rate. The type of changes produced and their sequence context are compatible with ADAR-mediated editing of the viral RNA.","publish_time":"2016-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuevas, Jos\u00E9 M.; Combe, Marine; Torres-Puente, Manoli; Garijo, Raquel; Guix, Susana; Buesa, Javier; Rodr\u00EDguez-D\u00EDaz, Jes\u00FAs; Sanju\u00E1n, Rafael","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be15631ecb296a3870b8ef56ec9332d7fc399201.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172324.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816301435; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.04.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816301435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hyper-mutation","spontaneous mutation rate","high mutation rates","spectrum of spontaneous mutations of human NoVs","presence of sequences","G transitions","large numbers of U","G base transitions","large fraction","frequency sequences","RNA viruses","multiple U","viral RNA","production of mutations","presence of low","Human noroviruses","intra-patient diversity","fold coverage","role","ultra-deep sequencing","ADAR-mediated editing","sequence context","stool samples","rapid immune escape","RT-PCR","capsid","transfection assays","population level","symptomatic patients","single cell infection cycle","major cause of gastroenteritis","type of changes"],"language":"en"},

Within a susceptible host species, there is often a striking difference between individual animals in their levels of resistance. Within susceptible species, resistance varies not only with the genetic constitution of the host but also with age, nutritional status, stress, and many other factors. These genetic and physiological factors determine what is called the nonspecific or innate resistance of the host, in contrast to the immunologically specific resistance that results from the operation of the immune response. Genetic differences in susceptibility are most obvious when different animal species are compared. Common viral infections often tend to be less pathogenic in their natural host species than in certain exotic or introduced species. Immunological responsiveness to particular antigens differs greatly from one strain of mouse to another, being under the control of specific immune response (Ir) genes. There are many of these genes, most of them situated in the region known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).","publish_time":"1987-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Here, we focused on the molecular mechanisms and found that the sole expression of the HBV core protein is sufficient for capsid release. Unexpectedly, released capsids are devoid of a detectable membrane bilayer, implicating a non\u2010vesicular exocytosis process. Unlike virions, naked capsid budding does not require the ESCRT machinery. Rather, we identified Alix, a multifunctional protein with key roles in membrane biology, as a regulator of capsid budding. Ectopic overexpression of Alix enhanced capsid egress, while its depletion inhibited capsid release. Notably, the loss of Alix did not impair HBV production, furthermore indicating that virions and capsids use diverse export routes. By mapping of Alix domains responsible for its capsid release\u2010mediating activity, its Bro1 domain was found to be required and sufficient. Alix binds to core via its Bro1 domain and retained its activity even if its ESCRT\u2010III binding site is disrupted.

Methods: A sample of 71 consecutive children enrolled in the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study were selected. Children suffering from frequently recurring respiratory infections (FRRIs) were defined as the highest quintile of the entire cohort of 329 children, as regards the number of upper respiratory infections (URIs) and/or episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) during the follow-up period from 2 to 24 months. Results: In the sample of 71 children, there were 18 children with FRRI (\u22659 URI and/or \u22654 AOM). Leukocyte cultures, prepared from blood drawn from these 18 children at 6 months of age, produced lower yields of IFN than those of the remaining 53 children, when stimulated with adenovirus (P\u003C0.001), coronavirus (P\u003C0.001) or rhinovirus (P=0.002). The difference in IFN yields was even greater (P\u003C0.001 with all three viruses) if the comparison was made between children with FRRI and those with no or maximally one URI during the follow-up period. When the IFN production capacity induced by rhinovirus was measured at the age of 24 months, a statistically significant difference between the children with FRRI and the others was also seen (P=0.002). Influenza A virus-induced IFN production capacity did not differ between the groups at either age (P=0.209). Conclusions: Lowered IFN responses in children suffering from recurrent URIs and/or AOM may, in a subgroup of the children, be due to a genetic property of the child. However, because of the great interindividual variations, we cannot use the IFN production capacity as such for prediction of forthcoming respiratory infections and/or otitis media.","publish_time":"1999-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pitk\u00E4ranta, Anne; Nokso-Koivisto, Johanna; J\u00E4ntti, Virva; Takala, Aino; Kilpi, Terhi; Hovi, Tapani","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45e6495ec548eaa7938bbe64d78bca371e7e35ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129541.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653299000566; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653299000566","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["consecutive children","IFN yields","virus-induced IFN production capacity","lower yields of IFN","Lowered IFN responses","recurring respiratory infections","AOM","months of age","risk of recurrent respiratory infections","prediction of forthcoming respiratory infections","number of upper respiratory infections","Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study","recurrent URIs","episodes of acute otitis media","leukocyte cultures","induced interferon","rhinovirus","follow-up period","sample","yield of virus","entire cohort","significant difference","correlation","FRRIs","Conclusions","Influenza","highest quintile","comparison","blood","groups","genetic property","great interindividual variations","Abstract Objective","Methods","viruses","subgroup","coronavirus","adenovirus","Results"],"language":"en"},

The latter two are involved in the suppression of the antiviral innate immune response of the host cell. To contribute to an understanding of this process, we present here the X-ray crystal structure of a complex between MERS-CoV PL(pro) and human ubiquitin (Ub) that is devoid of any covalent linkage between the two proteins. Five regions of the PL(pro) bind to two areas of the Ub. The C-terminal five residues of Ub, RLRGG, are similar to the P5\u2013P1 residues of the polyprotein substrates of the PL(pro) and are responsible for the major part of the interaction between the two macromolecules. Through sitedirected mutagenesis, we demonstrate that conserved Asp165 and non-conserved Asp164 are important for the catalytic activities of MERS-CoV PL(pro). The enzyme appears not to be optimized for catalytic efficiency; thus, replacement of Phe269 by Tyr leads to increased peptidolytic and deubiquitinating activities. Ubiquitin binding by MERS-CoV PL(pro) involves remarkable differences compared to the corresponding complex with SARS-CoV PL(pro). The structure and the mutational study help understand common and unique features of the deubiquitinating activity of MERS-CoV PL(pro).

We describe the characteristics of hospitalized Cambodian patients presenting with community-acquired acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) on post-infectious pulmonary sequelae (ALRIPS). Methods Between 2007 and 2010, inpatients \u226515 years with ALRI were prospectively recruited. Clinical, biological, radiological and microbiological data were collected. Chest radiographs were re-interpreted by experts to compare patients with ALRIPS, on previously healthy lungs (ALRIHL) and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Patients without chest radiograph abnormality or with abnormality suggestive as other chronic respiratory diseases were excluded from this analysis. Results Among the 2351 inpatients with community-acquired ALRI, 1800 were eligible: 426 (18%) ALRIPS, 878 (37%) ALRIHL and 496 (21%) TB. ALRIPS patients had less frequent fever than other ALRI (p \u003C 0.001) and more productive cough than ALRIHL (p \u003C 0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 83% of ALRIPS group positive cultures. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were significantly associated with ALRIPS compared with ALRIHL. Treatment was appropriate in 58% of ALRIPS patients. Finally, 79% of ALRIPS were not recognized by local clinicians. In-hospital mortality was low (1%) but probably underestimated in the ALRIPS group. Conclusion ALRIPS remains often misdiagnosed as TB with inappropriate treatment in low-income countries. Better-targeted training programs would help reduce the morbidity burden and financial costs.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rammaert, Blandine; Goyet, Sophie; Tarantola, Arnaud; Hem, Sopheak; Rith, Sareth; Cheng, Sokleaph; Te, Vantha; Try, Patrich Lorn; Guillard, Bertrand; Vong, Sirenda; Mayaud, Charles; Buchy, Philippe; Borand, Laurence","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61d5fb57988a7422b076d82490bf71974d7cf15b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125659.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611113002710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23937802/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611113002710; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2013.07.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALRI","ALRIHL"],"locations":["Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["ALRIPS patients","Conclusion ALRIPS","ALRIHL","ALRIPS group positive cultures","TB","post-infectious pulmonary sequelae","childhood pulmonary infections","active pulmonary tuberculosis","community","characteristics of hospitalized Cambodian patients","inpatients","chest radiograph abnormality","abnormality suggestive","acute lower respiratory infections","low-income countries","Haemophilus influenzae","frequent fever","Chest radiographs","inappropriate treatment","chronic respiratory diseases","Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted","experts","healthy lungs","morbidity burden","microbiological data","Streptococcus pneumoniae","productive cough","targeted training programs","financial costs","Summary Background","hospital mortality","analysis","Results","local clinicians","years","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The current clinical treatment for HSV-1 is based on nucleoside analogues, the use of which is limited due to drug resistance, side effects and poor bioavailability. AMPs have been identified as potential antiviral agents that may overcome these limitations. Therefore, we screened anti-HSV-1 peptides from a scorpion-derived AMP library and engineered one candidate into a histidine-rich peptide with significantly improved antiviral activity and development potential. Methods: A venomous gland cDNA library was constructed from the scorpion Euscorpiops validus in the Yunnan Province of China. Six putative AMPs were characterized from this cDNA library, and the synthesized peptides were screened via plaque-forming assays to determine their virucidal potential. Time of addition experiments according to the infection progress of HSV-1 were used to identify the modes of action for peptides of interest. The histidine-rich modification was designed based on structural analysis of peptides by a helical wheel model and CD spectroscopy. Peptide cellular uptake and distribution were measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Results: The peptide Eval418 was found to have high clearance activity in an HSV-1 plaque reduction assay. Eval418 exhibited dose-dependent and time-dependent inactivation of HSV-1 and dose-dependent inhibition of HSV-1 attachment to host cells. However, Eval418 scarcely suppressed an established HSV-1 infection due to poor cellular uptake. We further designed and modified Eval418 into four histidine-rich derivative peptides with enhanced antiviral activities and lower cytotoxicities. All of the derivative peptides suppressed established HSV-1 infections. One of these peptides, Eval418-FH5, not only had strong viral inactivation activity and enhanced attachment inhibitory activity but also had high inhibitory activity against intracellular HSV-1, which was consistent with its improved intracellular uptake and distribution as confirmed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Conclusion: We successfully identified an anti-HSV-1 peptide, Eval418, from a scorpion venom peptide library and designed a histidine-rich Eval418 derivative with significantly improved potential for further development as an anti-HSV-1 drug. This successful modification can provide a design strategy to improve the bioavailability, cellular distribution and antiviral activity of peptide agents.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Zhengyang; Zhang, Runhong; Hong, Wei; Cheng, Yuting; Wang, Huijuan; Lang, Yange; Ji, Zhenglin; Wu, Yingliang; Li, Wenxin; Xie, Youli; Cao, Zhijian","journal":"Theranostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29f72afab8b9894bede98ed862d87595374099c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5743469.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290802/; https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.21425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["anti-HSV","intracellular HSV","established HSV","peptide Eval418","infection progress of HSV","time-dependent inactivation of HSV","dose-dependent inhibition of HSV","histidine-rich peptide","antiviral activity of peptide agents","histidine-rich derivative peptides","histidine-rich Eval418 derivative","synthesized peptides","Peptide cellular uptake","Eval418-FH5","modified Eval418","scorpion venom peptide library","improved potential","high inhibitory activity","histidine-rich modification","potential antiviral agents","enhanced attachment inhibitory activity","high clearance activity","cellular distribution","structural analysis of peptides","development potential","strong viral inactivation activity","poor cellular uptake","improved intracellular uptake","virucidal potential","enhanced antiviral activities","scorpion-derived AMP library","venomous gland cDNA library","poor bioavailability","flow cytometry","confocal microscopy","scorpion Euscorpiops validus","human population","widespread human viral pathogens","successful modification","drug resistance","putative AMPs","Time of addition experiments","plaque reduction assay","helical wheel model","candidate","design strategy","lower cytotoxicities","Yunnan Province of China","CD spectroscopy","Methods","effects","large portion","severe diseases","assays","current clinical treatment","infections","nucleoside analogues","use","modes of action","limitations","cells","Results","Conclusion","Rationale"],"language":"en"},

For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2015-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galv\u00E1n, Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa; Rajas, Olga; Aspa, Javier","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c534fecaa526f597bb08a28b7cc952da3c309d51.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2123a7bb916a6200697beff6b7fe1f57f1680406.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105177.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1579212915003067; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1579212915003067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of syncytial respiratory virus","zoonotic influenza virus","influenza virus type","main pathogens","diagnosis of viral pneumonia","incidence of pneumonia","anti-influenza virus vaccination","viral infection","clinical setting","clinical picture","face of new emerging pathogens","upper respiratory tract symptoms","clinical progress of patients","new microorganisms","common infections","recent years","co-infection","significant number of community","outbreaks of deadly coronavirus","intensive care","introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques","need","monoclonal antibodies","leukocytes","fever","constant alert","cell culture","geriatric populations","antigen detection","different pneumonias","identification","Prevention","children","procalcitonin levels","immunosuppressed subjects","cases of exposure","human bocavirus","transmission","Neuraminidase inhibitors","antiviral","entity","bacteria","drugs","Ribavirin","viruses"],"language":"en"},

One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. RESULTS: We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we presented VirBin, a new contig binning tool for distinguishing contigs from different viral haplotypes with high sequence similarity. It competes favorably with other tools on viral contig binning.

Therefore, computational tools for reliably predicting linear B-cell epitopes are highly desirable. We evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained utilizing five different kernel methods using fivefold cross-validation on a homology-reduced data set of 701 linear B-cell epitopes, extracted from Bcipep database, and 701 non-epitopes, randomly extracted from SwissProt sequences. Based on the results of our computational experiments, we propose BCPred, a novel method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using the subsequence kernel. We show that the predictive performance of BCPred (AUC = 0.758) outperforms 11 SVM-based classifiers developed and evaluated in our experiments as well as our implementation of AAP (AUC = 0.7), a recently proposed method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using amino acid pair antigenicity. Furthermore, we compared BCPred with AAP and ABCPred, a method that uses recurrent neural networks, using two data sets of unique B-cell epitopes that had been previously used to evaluate ABCPred. Analysis of the data sets used and the results of this comparison show that conclusions about the relative performance of different B-cell epitope prediction methods drawn on the basis of experiments using data sets of unique B-cell epitopes are likely to yield overly optimistic estimates of performance of evaluated methods. This argues for the use of carefully homology-reduced data sets in comparing B-cell epitope prediction methods to avoid misleading conclusions about how different methods compare to each other.

Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter\u2019s search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (\u201Ccorona,\u201D \u201C2019-nCov,\u201D and \u201CCOVID-19\u201D), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alhuwail, Dari; Househ, Mowafa; Hamdi, Mounir; Shah, Zubair","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175788.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","health information","main topics","Health systems","monitoring social media","social media platforms","unique tweets","number of followers","collected tweets","health care organizations","mean number of retweets","agile public health presence","tweet topics of account followers","public English language tweets","mean sentiment","pandemic","Public health crisis response activities","world\u2019s health care infrastructure","number of issues","highest mean","unique users","topic modeling","economic losses","increased racism","sentiment analysis","user profile information","set of tools","surveillance systems","set of predefined search terms","Twitter users","main themes","international disease detection","recent coronavirus disease","Twitter\u2019s search application programming interface","API","unigrams","Tweepy Python library","word frequencies of single","PostgreSQL database","CONCLUSIONS","toll","policy makers","latent Dirichlet allocation","people","impact","sources","double words","origin","needs","governments","opportunity","psychological well-being of humanity","ways","economy","countries","bigrams","BACKGROUND","inclusion criteria","spread of fake news","metadata","interaction rate","study","deaths","travel","risk of infection","stakeholders","Individuals","METHODS","text","nCov","warnings","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Our novel findings thus suggest that the acute SARS-coronavirus infection probably contributes to the initial reduction of DC and T-cell subsets in blood, and that high-dose steroid administration may subsequently exacerbate and prolong low expression of the cell subsets. These findings will aid the framing of further studies of the immunopathogenesis of SARS.","publish_time":"2005-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zheng; Xu, Dongping; Li, Yonggang; Jin, Lei; Shi, Ming; Wang, Min; Zhou, Xianzhi; Wu, Hao; Gao, George F.; Wang, Fu-Sheng","journal":"Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a91067e5ee14e85e02f683ce95751d7748104acc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106242.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661605001518; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661605001518","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DC","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["normal cell numbers","T-cell subsets","numbers of DC","weeks of illness","numbers of circulating CD4","CD8 T cells","pDCs","mDCs","immunopathogenesis of SARS","mean of weeks","fold reductions","high-dose steroid administration","high-dose steroid treatment","acute SARS-coronavirus infection","earlier return","slow return","milder reductions","novel findings","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","initial reduction of DC","severe acute respiratory syndrome","patients","blood","convalescence","dramatic decrease","low expression","significant inverse correlation","framing","studies","healthy individuals","addition","study","Abstract","average"],"language":"en"},

The healing properties of Betula bark and bark extracts have been known for a long time in traditional medicine in different parts of the world. Several species of Betula have traditionally been used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases including arthritis. The purpose of this review is to provide updated, comprehensive and categorized information on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological and toxicological research of Betula species in order to explore their therapeutic potential and evaluate future research opportunities. Materials and methods All the available information on various species belonging to the genus Betula was collected via electronic search (using Pubmed, SciFinder, Scirus, Google Scholar, JCCC@INSTIRC and Web of Science) and a library search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Results Although over a hundred Betula species are found distributed globally, about 7 different species of Betula have been documented for their traditional uses. Phytochemical research on Betula species has led to the isolation of triterpenoids, diarylheptanoids, phenylbutanoids, lignans, phenolics and flavonoids. Crude extracts, fractions and phytochemical constituents isolated from Betula showed a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activities like immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, antidiabetic, dermatological, gastroprotective and hepatoprotective. Antiarthritic and anticancer are the two major areas of research conducted on these species. The anti-carcinogenic effects of Betula bark, betulin as well as betulinic acid have been extensively studied. Conclusions Several species belonging to the genus Betula are widely used in traditional medicine. Betula platyphylla and Betula pendula have specifically been found to be potentially useful in the treatment of degenerative joint disease. There is convincing evidence in experimental animal models in support of their anti-carcinogenic effects. However, it would be worthwhile to investigate the biochemical and physiological mechanisms as well as detailed preclinical toxicity, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the different biologically active extracts as well as molecules in sufficient detail. An integrated and holistic approach is required for tapping the full potentials of this important genus.","publish_time":"2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rastogi, Subha; Pandey, Madan Mohan; Kumar Singh Rawat, Ajay","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efa1265bf6ce581da6c4e2ab9358df582a2cdb12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126499.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114007934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25449458/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.11.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874114007934","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Betula"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genus Betula","different species of Betula","Betula platyphylla","Betula pendula","toxicological research of Betula species","various species","healing properties of Betula bark","anti-carcinogenic effects of Betula bark","bark extracts","traditional medicine","Phytochemical research","traditional uses","important genus","various ecosystems","Crude extracts","active extracts","different parts","future research opportunities","major areas of research","treatment of various inflammatory diseases","pharmacological activities","categorized information","available information","library search","electronic search","phytochemical constituents","treatment of degenerative joint disease","support","shrubs","boreal climate zones","phenylbutanoids","antidiabetic","JCCC","antioxidant","Google Scholar","detailed preclinical toxicity","antiviral","SciFinder","experimental animal models","anti-inflammatory","pharmacokinetics","pharmacodynamics","botany","phytochemistry","Betulaceae","order","therapeutic potential","lignans","physiological mechanisms","diarylheptanoids","INSTIRC","Scirus","bioavailability","Web of Science","articles","Pubmed","long time","fractions","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Trees","convincing evidence","isolation of triterpenoids","phenolics","gastroprotective","northern hemisphere","arthritis","methods","wide spectrum of","peer-reviewed journals","flavonoids","hepatoprotective","Materials","molecules","world","betulinic acid","holistic approach","Antiarthritic","potentials","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

Mice are continuous, polyestrous rodents that should be bred in polygamous or monogamous setups because of the males\u0027 aggressive territoriality behavior. When breeding mice that have been housed in a polygamous ratio, there may be one male with two to six females. Females are removed from a polygamous cage before parturition, whereas the monogamous pair is maintained together with the young until weaning. Mice are maintained in environments that are similar to other small rodents but require a thorough cleaning of their cage more often because of their malodorous urine. Ventilation is essential for small rodent housing to prevent irritation of the respiratory tract from ammonia vapors generated by urine. Quarantining is important when a new animal is being introduced into a setting in which there is an established group. As with other animals, a 30-day quarantine period is recommended, along with a physical examination and fecal parasite check. To maintain oversight of breeding animals\u0027 health and reduce the exposure of young animals to infectious disease and parasites, routine screening of representative animals within the colony is recommended. In very large colonies, special caging, food, and water may be necessary to prevent exposure to disease organisms.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tully, Thomas N.","journal":"Manual of Exotic Pet Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fae7bd824de728ee785c7cd701acfe238488fd74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152207.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500159; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mice","exposure of young animals","polygamous cage","small rodents","polygamous ratio","females","routine screening of representative animals","infectious disease","monogamous setups","disease organisms","monogamous pair","polyestrous rodents","malodorous urine","small rodent housing","oversight of breeding animals\u0027 health","parasites","food","irritation","special caging","respiratory tract","water","males\u0027 aggressive territoriality behavior","ammonia vapors","physical examination","fecal parasite check","large colonies","detailed information","Ventilation","chapter","rats","thorough cleaning","parturition","new animal","Quarantining","Publisher Summary","veterinarians","colony","environments","day quarantine period","setting","established group","weaning"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated serum concentrations of IP-10 in healthy individuals who developed acute respiratory infection (ARI). The hypothesis is that serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with ARI severity and detection of viral pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Data come from a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of mindfulness meditation or exercise on ARI (Clinical Trials ID: NCT01654289). Healthy adults ages 30\u201369 were followed for a single season for ARI incidence and severity. This trial is ongoing, and the investigators are still blinded. When a participant reported ARI symptoms, nasal swab and lavage for PCR-based viral identification and blood samples were collected within the first 72 hours of ARI symptoms. Serum IP-10 concentrations were measured by ELISA (R\u0026D Systems, Inc. Quantikine ELISA, Minneapolis, MN). ARI severity was measured using the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) until the ARI episode resolved. RESULTS: Serum IP-10 concentrations from 225 ARI episodes correlated with ARI global severity (rho 0.28 [95% CI: 0.15\u20130.39]; p\u003C0.001). IP-10 concentrations were higher with an ARI in which a viral pathogen was detected compared to no viral pathogen detected (median 366 pg/ml [IQR: 227\u2013486] vs 163 pg/ml [IQR: 127\u2013295], p\u003C0.0001). Influenza infections had higher IP-10 concentrations than coronavirus, enterovirus or rhinovirus, and paramyxovirus. CONCLUSION: Serum IP-10 concentration correlates with ARI global severity. Also, IP-10 concentration measured early in the course of the ARI correlates with the daily severity, duration, and illness symptoms.","publish_time":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayney, Mary S.; Henriquez, Kelsey M.; Barnet, Jodi H.; Ewers, Tola; Champion, Heather M.; Flannery, Sean; Barrett, Bruce","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96be5f9b19097830dfc959c08eafb881c7e5a033.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d437a204943daa53e0d7c1f218ae33d14d744ee9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5408957.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217300744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334685/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217300744; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.03.003; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5408957?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["ARI (Clinical Trials ID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARI severity","ARI correlates","ARI global severity","ARI episodes","ARI incidence","serum IP","serum concentrations of IP","hours of ARI symptoms","higher IP","daily severity","viral identification","concentration correlates","detection of viral pathogens","illness symptoms","pg","IQR","Quantikine ELISA","healthy individuals","STUDY DESIGN","acute respiratory infection","randomized controlled trial","Healthy adults ages","validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey","exercise","lavage","interferon-gamma inducible protein","PCR","effects of mindfulness meditation","WURSS","nasal swab","inflammatory chemokine","D Systems","Clinical Trials ID","Data","duration","coronavirus","Minneapolis","enterovirus","rhinovirus","kDa","NCT01654289","participant","single season","rho","blood samples","Influenza infections","BACKGROUND","MN","vs","course","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","paramyxovirus","investigators","hypothesis","biomarker","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must past through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This chapter discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) and hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires\u2019 disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease. Exposure to some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin, and actinomycetes when dispersed through the air can result in disease following inhalation. Fungal diseases included are histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and aspergillosis. The threat of bioterrorism with airborne infectious agents is also briefly presented.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stetzenbach, L.

However, data on the clinical outcomes of such patients is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical outcomes of four patients who were admitted at the intensive care unit during the 2017\u20132018 influenza season with severe sepsis (SOFA score \u003E 11) and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures. The median time for zanamivir treatment was 10 days (IQR 10\u201317). The clinical outcome was favourable with all four patients surviving and improving clinically. All four patients achieved viral clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09 genome, and resolution of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: IV zanamivir could be a good therapeutic option in patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection who are unable to take oral or aerosolised antiviral medication. We recommend prospective randomized control trials to support this hypothesis.","publish_time":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torti, Carlo; Mazzitelli, Maria; Longhini, Federico; Garofalo, Eugenio; Bruni, Andrea; Giancotti, Aida; Barreca, Giorgio Settimo; Quirino, Angela; Liberto, Maria Carla; Serapide, Francesca; Matera, Giovanni; Trecarichi, Enrico Maria; Navalesi, Paolo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88f00457544e21a031e4b643cd71affe006a5d7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6796355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619209/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4530-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["ECMO","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","zanamivir treatment","H1N1","pdm09 infection","treatment of severe influenza","pdm09 genome","infection resolution","clinical outcomes","resolution of multidrug","severe sepsis","influenza season","ECMO","mechanical ventilation","viral clearance","concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections","inhaled medication","aerosolised antiviral medication","Weekly qualitative PCR analysis","acute respiratory distress syndrome","SOFA score","nasopharyngeal specimen swabs","polymerase chain reaction","good therapeutic option","administration","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","example","suitable alternative","days","prospective randomized control trials","median time","hypothesis","receipt of negative results","blood cultures","IQR","intensive care unit","CASE PRESENTATION","BACKGROUND","dose","data","CONCLUSIONS","addition"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our research was to test the efficiency of PO(2)/FiO(2) and CAP severity scores in predicting mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission with influenza pneumonia patients. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with positive influenza virus RNA detection in Beijing Chao\u2010Yang Hospital during the 2009\u20132014 influenza seasons. Outpatients, inpatients with no pneumonia and incomplete data were excluded. We used receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) to verify the accuracy of severity scores or indices as mortality predictors in the study patients. RESULTS: Among 170 hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia, 30 (17.6%) died. Among those who were classified as low\u2010risk (predicted mortality 0.1%\u20132.1%) by pneumonia severity index (PSI) or confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age \u226565 year (CURB\u201065), the actual mortality ranged from 5.9 to 22.1%. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that hypoxia (PO(2)/FiO(2) \u2264 250) and lymphopenia (peripheral blood lymphocyte count \u003C0.8 \u00D7 10(9)/L) were independent risk factors for mortality, with OR value of 22.483 (95% confidence interval 4.927\u2013102.598) and 5.853 (95% confidence interval 1.887\u201318.152), respectively. PO(2)/FiO(2) combined lymphocyte count performed well for mortality prediction with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.945, which was significantly better than current CAP severity scores of PSI, CURB\u201065 and confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age \u226565 years for mortality prediction (P \u003C 0.001). The scores or indices for ICU admission prediction to hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia confirmed a similar pattern and PO(2)/FiO(2) combined lymphocyte count was also the best predictor for predicting ICU admission. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that PO(2)/FiO(2) combined lymphocyte count is simple and reliable predictor of hospitalized patients with influenza pneumonia in predicting mortality and ICU admission.

However, current traditional inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines are of limited efficacy against circulating PEDV variants, and there are no commercial vaccines for prevention of PDCoV and SADS-CoV. RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool in therapeutic applications to inhibit viral replication in vitro. In this study, we developed a small interfering RNA generation system that expressed two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the M gene of PEDV and SADS-CoV and the N gene of PDCoV, respectively. Our results demonstrated that simultaneous expression of these specific shRNA molecules inhibited expression of PEDV M gene, SADS-CoV M gene, and PDCoV N gene RNA by 99.7%, 99.4%, and 98.8%, respectively, in infected cell cultures. In addition, shRNA molecules significantly restricted the expression of M and N protein, and impaired the replication of PEDV, SADS-CoV, and PDCoV simultaneously. Taken together, this shRNAs expression system not only is proved to be a novel approach for studying functions of various genes synchronously, but also developed to test aspects of a potential therapeutic option for treatment and prevention of multiple SECoV infections.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Kai; Li, Hao; Bi, Zhen; Song, Deping; Zhang, Fanfan; Lei, Dan; Luo, Suxian; Li, Zhiquan; Gong, Wang; Huang, Dongyan; Ye, Yu; Tang, Yuxin","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a73149de69132032bc769a2d43c6a98cf663a069.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113732.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905822/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.03.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218306223; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218306223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PDCoV N gene RNA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["gene of PEDV","expression of PEDV","SADS-CoV","N gene of PDCoV","replication of PEDV","PDCoV N gene RNA","prevention of PDCoV","attenuated PEDV vaccines","circulating PEDV variants","shRNAs expression system","simultaneous expression","N protein","RNA interference","specific shRNA molecules","small interfering RNA generation system","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","commercial vaccines","therapeutic applications","porcine deltacoronavirus","viral replication","swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus","potential therapeutic option","Abstract Swine enteric coronaviruses","prevention of multiple SECoV infections","treatment","SECoVs","limited efficacy","different short hairpin RNAs","powerful tool","China","RNAi","functions of various genes","novel approach","pig populations","aspects","infected cell cultures","study","results","addition","years"],"language":"en"},

We found significant cross-reactivity between viruses with similar HA sequences. Interestingly, A/FortMonmouth/1/1947 antisera cross-reacted with A/USSR/90/1977 virus, thought to be a 1947 resurfaced virus. Importantly, our immunological data that didn\u0027t show cross-reactivity can be extrapolated to failure of past H1N1 influenza vaccines, ie. 1947, 1986 and 2009. Together, our results help to elucidate H1N1 immuno-genetic alterations that occurred in the past 100 years and immune responses caused by H1N1 evolution. This work will facilitate development of future influenza therapeutics and prophylactics such as influenza vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Stephen S.

Cleavage and activation of SARS S by a host cell protease is essential for infectious viral entry and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 cleaves and activates SARS S in cell culture and potentially also in the infected host. Here, we investigated which determinants in SARS S control cleavage and activation by TMPRSS2. We found that SARS S residue R667, a previously identified trypsin cleavage site, is also required for S protein cleavage by TMPRSS2. The cleavage fragments produced by trypsin and TMPRSS2 differed in their decoration with N-glycans, suggesting that these proteases cleave different SARS S glycoforms. Although R667 was required for SARS S cleavage by TMPRSS2, this residue was dispensable for TMPRSS2-mediated S protein activation. Conversely, residue R797, previously reported to be required for SARS S activation by trypsin, was dispensable for S protein cleavage but required for S protein activation by TMPRSS2.

So far, there is limited knowledge on the mechanisms of persistence, and no reports on chronic infections or latency have been published so far. CASE PRESENTATION: An immunocompetent male patient suffers from a chronic HBoV1 infection, i.e. viral DNA was detected in both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for \u003E5 months without co-infections and with respiratory symptoms resolved spontaneously while receiving symptomatic treatment with montelukast and corticosteroids. Following the symptomatic medication of a chronic infection with HBoV1 viraemia indicating active viral replication lasting over 5 months, the patient cleared the viraemia and no further viral DNA was detectable in the BAL. However, by fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of mucosal biopsies, it was shown that the virus genome still persisted in the absence of viral shedding but in a more compact manner possibly representing a supercoiled episomal form of this otherwise linear single-stranded DNA genome. This indicated the entry into a latency phase. Moreover, the cytokine profile and the IP-10/TARC ratio, a marker for fibrotization, seem to have been altered by HBoV1 replication. Although specific IgG antibodies were detectable during the whole observation period, they showed an apparently insufficient neutralising activity. CONCLUSION: On the one hand, these findings suggest that the symptomatic medication may have led to clearance of the virus from blood and airways and, moreover, that the viral DNA persists in the tissue as an altered episomal form favoured by lacking neutralising antibodies. This appears to be important in order to reduce possible long-term effects such as lung fibrosis.","publish_time":"2016-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Windisch, Wolfram; Pieper, Monika; Ziemele, Inga; Rockstroh, J\u00FCrgen; Brockmann, Michael; Schildgen, Oliver; Schildgen, Verena","journal":"JMM Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc0e5bc9be7b590166a4f4c859ff9ee16b31a30f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5330242.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1099/jmmcr.0.005052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral DNA","chronic infections","chronic HBoV1 infection","active viral replication","HBoV1 viraemia","respiratory infections","HBoV1 replication","symptomatic medication","absence of viral shedding","months","altered episomal form","co-infections","symptomatic treatment","neutralising antibodies","virus genome","linear single-stranded DNA genome","supercoiled episomal form","respiratory symptoms","latency phase","immunocompetent male patient","specific IgG antibodies","insufficient neutralising activity","possible long-term effects","compact manner","serum","reports","situ hybridization analyses of mucosal biopsies","tissue","mechanisms of persistence","IP","TARC ratio","order","fluorescence","lung fibrosis","BAL","CASE PRESENTATION","clearance","human bocavirus","INTRODUCTION","marker","fibrotization","parvovirus","limited knowledge","bronchoalveolar lavage","blood","observation period","findings","hand","cytokine profile","entry","airways","corticosteroids","CONCLUSION","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A cross sectional quantitative study design complemented with qualitative method was conducted among 350 health care workers in Feburary26-June5/2012. Pretested self-administered questionnaire and observation checklist were used to collect data on different variables. Data entry and data analysis were done using Epi-Info version 3.5.1 and by SPSS version19, respectively. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses were applied to describe study objectives and identify the determinants of information seeking behaviours respectively. Odds ratio with 95% CI was used to assess the association between a factor and an outcome variable. RESULTS: The majority of the respondents acknowledged the need of health information to their routine activities. About 54.0% of respondents lacked access to health information. Only 42.8% of respondents have access to internet sources. Important barriers to access information were geographical, organizational, personal, economic, educational status and time. About 58.0% of the respondents accessed information by referring their hard copies and asking senior staff. Age, sex, income, computer literacy and access, patient size, work experience and working site were significantly associated with information needs and seeking behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The health information seeking behaviour of health professional was significant. The heaklth facilities had neither informationcenter such as library, nor internet facilities.

This completes the sequence of the TGEV genome, which is 28,579 nucleotides long. The gene 1 is composed of two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, which contain 4017 and 2698 codons, respectively (stop excluded). A brief, three-codon-long ORF is present upstream of ORF1a. ORF1b overlaps ORF1a by 43 bases in the (-1) reading frame. In vitro experiments indicated that translation of the ORF1a/b polyprotein involves an efficient ribosomal frameshifting activity, as previously shown for other coronaviruses. Analysis of the predicted ORF1a and ORF1b translation products revealed that the putative functional domains identified in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCV 229E) are all present in TGEV. The amino-terminal half of the ORFla product exhibits greater divergence then the carboxy-terminal half, including within the TGEV/HCV229E pair. The ORF1b protein is overall highly conserved among the above four coronaviruses, except a divergent region situated near the carboxy terminus.","publish_time":"1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eleouet, Jean-Francois; Rasschaert, Denis; Lambert, Patrick; Levy, Laurent; Vende, Patrice; Laude, Hubert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285710045; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285710045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORF1b overlaps ORF1a","predicted ORF1a","present upstream of ORF1a","ORF1b protein","TGEV genome","ORF1b translation products","carboxy-terminal half","gene","coronaviruses","infectious bronchitis virus","mouse hepatitis virus","amino-terminal half","strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","carboxy terminus","untranslated region","divergent region","large open reading frames","entire nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNAs","ORFla product exhibits greater divergence","putative functional domains","b polyprotein","Purdue","MHV","human coronavirus","IBV","codon-long ORF","efficient ribosomal frameshifting activity","nucleotides","bases","Analysis","brief","HCV229E pair","experiments","codons"],"language":"en"},

Crucial to halting PDCoV transmission and infection is the development of effective therapies and vaccines. The spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the major target of host neutralizing antibodies, however the immunodominant neutralizing region in the S protein of PDCoV has not been defined. Here, three truncations of the PDCoV S protein were generated, the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (NTD, amino acids (aa) 50\u2013286), the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (CTD, aa 278\u2013616), and S2 subunit (aa 601\u20131087). The proteins were expressed using an E. coli expression system. Polyclonal antisera against the three recombinant proteins were produced in rabbits and mice. All three antisera were able to inhibit PDCoV infection in vitro, as determined by virus neutralization assay, fluorescent focus neutralization assay, and plaque-reduction neutralization. The CTD-specific antisera had the most potent PDCoV-neutralizing effect, indicating that the CTD region may contain the major neutralizing epitope(s) in the PDCoV S protein. Based on these findings, CTD may be a promising target for development of an effective vaccine against PDCoV infection in pigs.","publish_time":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Rui; Fu, Jiayu; Hu, Jingfei; Li, Cheng; Zhao, Yujia; Qu, Huan; Wen, Xintian; Cao, Sanjie; Wen, Yiping; Wu, Rui; Zhao, Qin; Yan, Qigui; Huang, Yong; Ma, Xiaoping; Han, Xinfeng; Huang, Xiaobo","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfe7efa99b2805f018714d78ba28d80afbac589b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816342/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197834; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219302850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219302850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S protein of PDCoV","PDCoV S protein","PDCoV infection","potent PDCoV","halting PDCoV transmission","protein of coronavirus","CTD region","CTD-specific antisera","S1 subunit","major neutralizing epitope","virus neutralization assay","pigs","major target of host neutralizing antibodies","S2 subunit","Polyclonal antisera","fluorescent focus neutralization assay","plaque-reduction neutralization","development of effective therapies","N-terminal domain","C-terminal domain","effective vaccine","promising target","recombinant proteins","emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus","NTD","immunodominant","amino acids","novel threat","swine husbandry","rabbits","vaccines","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","spike","truncations","coli expression system","mice","findings"],"language":"en"},

For this reason, we constructed a yeast expression vector containing CaMV ORF VII fused to CaMV ORF III by a fragment of 452 bp including the overlapping region of ORF IV and ORF V, ORF VII and ORF III being used as reporter genes. We characterized two proteins (22 and 50 kDa) synthesized from this plasmid in the yeast expression system. We demonstrated that the 50-kDa polypeptide is not synthesized from a \u002B1 frameshifting event but is probably a dimeric form of the 22-kDa protein.

Primers and probes for sixteen PCR assays were selected from the literature or newly designed. Following optimization of individual PCR assays, strip-tube arrays were prepared by dispensing primer-probe mixes (PPM) into two sets of 8-tube strips.

However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the first few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedes-transmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015\u20132017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riou, Julien; Poletto, Chiara; Bo\u00EBlle, Pierre-Yves","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1fa74682266ab3d64275b8f738e8e9a37732efe.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7cbfd22d36a109e840f1572eb2fcf6794b73070b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6002135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6002135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Indies"],"keyphrases":["times","range","actual peak incidence","past Aedes-transmitted epidemics","Aedes-transmitted diseases","maximal incidence","date of peak incidence","distributions","incidence data points","historical information","early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks","early forecasts of final epidemic size","historical data","little information","past CHIKV epidemics","sharpness of forecasts","Zika virus epidemics","average","forecasting models","Hierarchical models","eventual size","islands","French West Indies","decision-making","reproduction ratio","real value","beginning","total duration","epidemiological assessment","example","chikungunya","sharper","reporting rates","places","Improvements","respect","accuracy","framework","predictions","approach","locations"],"language":"en"},

Nipah virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, posing a high risk for epidemic outbreaks. However, a broadly applicable approach for human NiV outbreaks in field settings is lacking. METHODS: We engineered new antiviral lipopeptides and analyzed in vitro fusion inhibition to identify an optimal candidate for prophylaxis of NiV infection in the lower respiratory tract, and we assessed antiviral efficiency in 2 different animal models. RESULTS: We show that lethal NiV infection can be prevented with lipopeptides delivered via the respiratory route in both hamsters and nonhuman primates. By targeting retention of peptides for NiV prophylaxis in the respiratory tract, we avoid its systemic delivery in individuals who need only prevention, and thus we increase the safety of treatment and enhance utility of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The experiments provide a proof of concept for the use of antifusion lipopeptides for prophylaxis of lethal NiV. These results advance the goal of rational development of potent lipopeptide inhibitors with desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties and a safe effective delivery method to target NiV and other pathogenic viruses.","publish_time":"2018-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathieu, Cyrille; Porotto, Matteo; Figueira, Tiago N; Horvat, Branka; Moscona, Anne","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09b04a54167b4f8751ed9f1e373449404d1fc924.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6009590.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/218/2/218/25068532/jiy152.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozcw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NiV prophylaxis","prophylaxis of NiV infection","prophylaxis of lethal NiV","lethal NiV infection","human NiV outbreaks","respiratory route","lower respiratory tract","new antiviral lipopeptides","RESULTS","use of antifusion lipopeptides","antiviral efficiency","high risk","systemic delivery","epidemic outbreaks","person contact","emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus Nipah virus","high fatality rates","safe effective delivery method","biodistribution properties","humans","goal of rational development of potent lipopeptide inhibitors","neurological disease","optimal candidate","fusion inhibition","proof of concept","applicable approach","field settings","different animal models","BACKGROUND","hamsters","nonhuman primates","retention of peptides","utility","experiments","individuals","METHODS","safety of treatment","pathogenic viruses","intervention","CONCLUSIONS","prevention"],"language":"en"},

Routinely, it requires submission of multiple samples to separate laboratories. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have provided the opportunity for development of a comprehensive method to identify infectious agents. This study describes the use of target-specific primers for PCR-mediated amplification with the NGS technology in which pathogen genomic regions of interest are enriched and selectively sequenced from clinical samples. In the study, 198 primers were designed to target 43 common bovine and small-ruminant bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens, and a bioinformatics tool was specifically constructed for the detection of targeted pathogens. The primers were confirmed to detect the intended pathogens by testing reference strains and isolates. The method was then validated using 60 clinical samples (including tissues, feces, and milk) that were also tested with other routine diagnostic techniques. The detection limits of the targeted NGS method were evaluated using 10 representative pathogens that were also tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the NGS method was able to detect the organisms from samples with qPCR threshold cycle (C(T)) values in the 30s. The method was successful for the detection of multiple pathogens in the clinical samples, including some additional pathogens missed by the routine techniques because the specific tests needed for the particular organisms were not performed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and indicate that it is possible to incorporate NGS as a diagnostic tool in a cost-effective manner into a veterinary diagnostic laboratory.","publish_time":"2018-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anis, Eman; Hawkins, Ian K.; Ilha, Marcia R.

Identifying mechanisms responsible for such T cell dysfunction is therefore of great importance to understand how to prevent persistent viral infection. Here we show using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection that carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is fundamental for recruiting lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (Lck) into the T cell receptor complex to form an efficient immunological synapse. CEACAM1 is essential for activation of CD8(\u002B) T cells, and the absence of CEACAM1 on virus-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells limits the antiviral CD8(\u002B) T cell response. Treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody stabilizes Lck in the immunological synapse, prevents CD8(\u002B) T cell exhaustion, and improves control of virus infection in vivo. Treatment of human virus-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells with anti-CEACAM1 antibody similarly enhances their proliferation. We conclude that CEACAM1 is an important regulator of virus-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell functions in mice and humans and represents a promising therapeutic target for modulating CD8(\u002B) T cells.","publish_time":"2018-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khairnar, Vishal; Duhan, Vikas; Patil, Ashwini M.; Zhou, Fan; Bhat, Hilal; Thoens, Christine; Sharma, Piyush; Adomati, Tom; Friendrich, Sarah-Kim; Bezgovsek, Judith; Dreesen, Janine D.; Wennemuth, Gunther; Westendorf, Astrid M.; Zelinskyy, Gennadiy; Dittmer, Ulf; Hardt, Cornelia; Timm, J\u00F6rg; G\u00F6thert, Joachim R.; Lang, Philipp A.; Singer, Bernhard B.; Lang, Karl S.","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9b9b75ee4d554ad43e8a8531af0b6763a1d6652.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6028648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028648/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","T cell dysfunction","T cell functions","T cell exhaustion","T cell response","Dysfunction of CD8","modulating CD8","antiviral CD8","activation of CD8","T cell receptor complex","Treatment of human virus-specific CD8","absence of CEACAM1","anti-CEACAM1 antibody","control of virus infection","important regulator of virus","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","persistent viral infection","Lck","development of chronic viral infection","carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule","efficient immunological synapse","recruiting lymphocyte-specific protein kinase","humans","LCMV","promising therapeutic target","mice","great importance","mechanisms responsible","proliferation"],"language":"en"},

Surprisingly, we find that avirulent type III parasites are preferentially cleared in naive macrophages, independent of gamma interferon (IFN-\u03B3) activation. The ability of naive macrophages to clear type III parasites was dependent on enhanced activity of NADPH oxidase (Nox)-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of guanylate binding protein 5 (Gbp5). Macrophages infected with type III parasites (CTG strain) showed a time-dependent increase in intracellular ROS generation that was higher than that induced by type I parasites (GT1 strain). The absence of Nox1 or Nox2, gp91 subunit isoforms of the Nox complex, reversed ROS-mediated clearance of CTG parasites. Consistent with this finding, both Nox1(\u2212/\u2212) and Nox2(\u2212/\u2212) mice showed higher susceptibility to CTG infection than wild-type mice. Additionally, Gbp5 expression was induced upon infection and the enhanced clearance of CTG strain parasites was reversed in Gbp5(\u2212/\u2212) macrophages. Expression of a type I ROP18 allele in CTG prevented clearance in naive macrophages, suggesting that it plays a role counteracting Gbp5. Although ROS and Gbp5 have been linked to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, clearance of CTG parasites did not rely on induction of pyroptosis. Collectively, these findings reveal that not all strains of T. gondii are adept at avoiding clearance in macrophages and define new roles for ROS and Gbps in controlling this important intracellular pathogen.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matta, Sumit K.; Patten, Kelley; Wang, Quiling; Kim, Bae-Hoon; MacMicking, John D.; Sibley, L.

Ducks are commonly affected by severe diseases, including egg-drop syndrome caused by duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV). The immune mechanisms against DTMUV invasion and infection remain poorly understood. In this study, duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were infected with DTMUV and harvested at 12 and 24 h post-infection (hpi), and their genomes were sequenced. In total, 911 (764 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes) and 3008 (1791 upregulated and 1217 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were considerably enriched in immune-relevant pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Hematopoietic cell lineage at both time points. The key DEGs in immune system included those of the cytokines (IFN \u03B12, IL-6, IL-8L, IL-12B, CCR7, CCL19, and CCL20), transcription factors or signaling molecules (IRF7, NF-\u03BAB, STAT1, TMEM173, and TNFAIP3), pattern recognition receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), and antigen-presenting proteins (CD44 and CD70). This suggests DTMUV infection induces strong proinflammatory/antiviral effects with enormous production of cytokines. However, these cytokines could not protect DEFs against viral attack. Our data revealed valuable transcriptional information regarding DTMUV-infected DEFs, thereby broadening our understanding of the immune response against DTMUV infection; this information might contribute in developing strategies for controlling the prevalence of DTMUV infection.","publish_time":"2018-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Guanliu; Lin, Yun; Tang, Yi; Diao, Youxiang","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daf4eb5387fb452ec6b363fe7ed346df579535c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6121397.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Toll-like"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of DTMUV infection","DTMUV-infected DEFs","DTMUV invasion","IL","immune response","immune system","immune mechanisms","downregulated genes","h post-infection","Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway","RIG","immune-relevant pathways","key DEGs","hpi","enormous production of cytokines","duck embryo fibroblasts","duck Tembusu virus","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","valuable transcriptional information","Genomes enrichment analysis","antiviral effects","strong proinflammatory","IRF7","China","Hematopoietic cell lineage","TNFAIP3","molecules","TMEM173","STAT1","NF-\u03BAB","syndrome","Toll","understanding","high-economic benefit","NOD","pattern recognition receptors","major waterfowl species","transcription factors","CCL19","CCL20","time points","CCR7","egg","study","data","Chemokine","severe diseases","developing strategies","IFN \u03B12","proteins","CD44","antigen","population","MDA5","viral attack","CD70","Ducks","total","year"],"language":"en"},

Spinal cord demyelination is also induced following intranasal inoculation with neurotropic MHV strains, however much higher viral doses are required as compared to intracranial inoculation. Recently, it was shown that intranasal administration of low concentrations of proteins leads to significant, rapid accumulation of protein in the optic nerve and in the eye, with only low levels reaching spinal cord and other brain regions. Thus, we examined whether intranasal inoculation with MHV at doses equivalent to those given intracranially could induce optic neuritis\u2014inflammation, demyelination and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the optic nerve with or without inducing spinal cord demyelination. Four week old male C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intracranially with the recombinant demyelinating strain RSA59, or intranasally with RSA59 or the non-demyelinating strain RSMHV2 as control. One month post-inoculation, mice inoculated intracranially with RSA59 had significant myelin loss in both spinal cord and optic nerves, with significant loss of RGCs as well, consistent with prior studies. As expected, intranasal inoculation with RSA59 failed to induce demyelination in spinal cord; however, it also did not induce optic nerve demyelination. No acute inflammation was found, and no viral antigen was detected, in the optic nerve or retina 1 day after inoculation. Results confirm the neurotropic effects of RSA59 following intracranial inoculation, and suggest that direct infection with axonal transport of virus from brain to spinal cord and optic nerve is required to induce demyelinating disease. These studies suggest that MHV does not selectively concentrate in optic nerve and retina to sufficient levels to induce demyelination following intranasal inoculation. Intracranial inoculation should continue to be considered a preferred method for studies of MHV-induced optic neuritis and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease.","publish_time":"2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Manmeet; Khan, Reas S.; Dine, Kimberly; Das Sarma, Jayasri; Shindler, Kenneth S.","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb65ef8d3ff24ddb51c4f091a46394f513a9d4d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6132074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6132074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optic nerve demyelination","intranasal inoculation","Spinal cord demyelination","intracranial inoculation","optic nerves","optic neuritis","chronic demyelination","studies of MHV","month post-inoculation","neurotropic MHV strains","recombinant demyelinating strain RSA59","neurotropic effects of RSA59","significant loss of RGCs","acute inflammation","significant myelin loss","non-demyelinating strain RSMHV2","human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis","J mice","low levels","intranasal administration of low concentrations of proteins","prior studies","Neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus","axonal transport of virus","higher viral doses","axonal spread","loss of retinal ganglion cells","sufficient levels","brain regions","doses equivalent","viral antigen","pathologic features similar","central nervous system","CNS","direct infection","rapid accumulation of protein","week old male C57BL","control","eye","day","preferred method","Results"],"language":"en"},

Since the inhibition of v-ATPase resulted in anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in different tumor models, this enzyme has emerged as promising strategy against cancer. Here, we used the well-established v-ATPase inhibitor archazolid, a natural product first isolated from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, to study the consequences of v-ATPase inhibition in endothelial cells (ECs), in particular on the interaction between ECs and cancer cells, which has been neglected so far. Human endothelial cells treated with archazolid showed an increased adhesion of tumor cells, whereas the transendothelial migration of tumor cells was reduced. The adhesion process was independent from the EC adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and N-cadherin. Instead, the adhesion was mediated by \u03B21-integrins expressed on tumor cells, as blocking of the integrin \u03B21 subunit reversed this process. Tumor cells preferentially adhered to the \u03B21-integrin ligand collagen and archazolid led to an increase in the amount of collagen on the surface of ECs. The accumulation of collagen was accompanied by a strong decrease of the expression and activity of the protease cathepsin B. Overexpression of cathepsin B in ECs prevented the capability of archazolid to increase the adhesion of tumor cells onto ECs. Our study demonstrates that the inhibition of v-ATPase by archazolid induces a pro-adhesive phenotype in endothelial cells that promotes their interaction with cancer cells, whereas the transmigration of tumor cells was reduced. These findings further support archazolid as a promising anti-metastatic compound.","publish_time":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luong, Betty; Schwenk, Rebecca; Br\u00E4utigam, Jacqueline; M\u00FCller, Rolf; Menche, Dirk; Bischoff, Iris; F\u00FCrst, Robert","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1b81916fac1ca3d50dde774df2e1bb26bf0fb39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6133348.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6133348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B.

In this study, we analyzed placental samples obtained at the time of delivery from a group of 24 women diagnosed with ZIKV infection during the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the third trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these third-trimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thirty-three percent of women infected during pregnancy delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection, the IHC positivity of HCs in placental tissues and the presence of congenital malformations at birth was observed. Placental tissue analysis enabled us to confirm maternal ZIKV infection in cases where serum from the acute infection phase was not available, which reinforces the importance of this technique in identifying possible causal factors of birth defects. The results we observed in the samples from naturally infected pregnant women may contribute to the understanding of some aspects of the pathophysiology of ZIKV.","publish_time":"2018-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Noronha, Lucia; Zanluca, Camila; Burger, Marion; Suzukawa, Andreia Akemi; Azevedo, Marina; Rebutini, Patricia Z.; Novadzki, Iolanda Maria; Tanabe, Laurina Setsuko; Presibella, Mayra Marinho; Duarte dos Santos, Claudia Nunes","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1d65769b15ff7bd395ae21186fd09642f69571f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6180237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6180237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","Hofbauer","IHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maternal ZIKV infection","placental samples","pathophysiology of ZIKV","trimester placental tissues","placentas of women","ZIKV intrauterine transmission","acute infection phase","development of placental abnormalities","Placental tissue analysis","ZIKV-positive fetal cells","infected pregnant women","congenital abnormalities","percent of women","IHC positivity of HCs","presence of congenital malformations","trimesters of pregnancy","vulnerable period of pregnancy","physiopathological aspects","possible causal factors of birth defects","Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells","serum","severe outcomes","main histological finding","cases","cell types","pattern","humans","neurological disorders","gestational stage","number of syncytial sprouts","technique","Villous immaturity","understanding","time of delivery","group","infants","Significant enhancement","Zika virus","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","importance","mechanism","immunohistochemical","alterations","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Here, we analyzed a large mixed cohort of immunocompromised patients with PcP, with regard to clinical course and treatment, and aimed at identifying predictors of outcome. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective analysis in a tertiary care institution across 17 years. Diagnosis of PcP required typical clinical features and microbiological confirmation of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were collected from patient records. RESULTS: A total of 52,364 specimens from 7504 patients were sent for microbiological assessment (3653 with clinical suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia). PcP was confirmed in 240 patients, about half of them HIV positive (52%). The remaining subjects were either solid organ transplant recipients (16.3%) or suffered from malignancy (15.8%) or autoimmune diseases (11.7%). Of note, 95% of patients with PcP were not receiving chemoprophylaxis. Overall in-hospital mortality was 25.4%, increasing to 58% if ICU admission was required. Multivariable regression identified lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.17 (95% CI 1.09\u20131.27), p \u003C 0.0001). Mortality in LDH quartiles increased from 8% to 49%, and a cutoff value of 495 U/L predicted mortality with sensitivity and specificity of 70%. With regard to treatment, 40% of patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at doses that were lower than recommended, and these patients had a higher mortality risk (HR 1.80 (95% CI 1.10\u20133.44), p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: PcP remains a life-threatening disease among immunocompromised patients. About half of patients with PcP do not have HIV infection. Initial LDH values might serve as a stratifying tool to identify those patients at high risk of death among patients with HIV and without HIV infection.

Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect.

Usb1 is an exoribonuclease that shortens the oligo-uridine tail of U6 snRNA, resulting in a terminal 2\u2032,3\u2032 cyclic phosphate group in most eukaryotes, including humans. Loss of function mutations in human Usb1 cause the rare disorder poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN), and result in U6 snRNAs with elongated 3\u2032 ends that are aberrantly adenylated. Here, we show that human Usb1 removes 3\u2032 adenosines with 20-fold greater efficiency than uridines, which explains the presence of adenylated U6 snRNAs in cells lacking Usb1. We determined three high-resolution co-crystal structures of Usb1: wild-type Usb1 bound to the substrate analog adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate, and an inactive mutant bound to RNAs with a 3\u2032 terminal adenosine and uridine. These structures, along with QM/MM MD simulations of the catalytic mechanism, illuminate the molecular basis for preferential deadenylation of U6 snRNA. The extent of Usb1 processing is influenced by the secondary structure of U6 snRNA.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nomura, Yuichiro; Roston, Daniel; Montemayor, Eric J; Cui, Qiang; Butcher, Samuel E","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/468d8047a0283ba355246ed938fac8434a589a26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6265477.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6265477/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human Usb1","wild-type Usb1","extent of Usb1 processing","preferential deadenylation of U6 snRNA","secondary structure of U6 snRNA","oligo-uridine tail of U6 snRNA","presence of adenylated U6 snRNAs","high-resolution co-crystal structures of Usb1","terminal adenosine","Post-transcriptional modification of snRNA","spliceosome function","substrate analog adenosine","Loss of function mutations","molecular basis","rare disorder poikiloderma","PN","catalytic mechanism","neutropenia","monophosphate","result","cells","eukaryotes","MD simulations","cyclic phosphate group","adenosines","greater efficiency","uridines","inactive mutant","QM","exoribonuclease","humans"],"language":"en"},

HHT completely inhibited infections of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) at concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 nM in cell cultures, respectively. Treatment with HHT at doses of 0.05 or 0.2 mg/kg significantly reduced viral load and relieved severe symptoms in PEDV- or NDV-infected animals. HHT treatment, however, moderately inhibited avian influenza virus (AIV) infection, suggesting its potent antiviral action is restricted to a number of classes of RNA viruses. In this study, we also observed that HHT actively inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 139 nM; the treatment with HHT at 1000 nM led to reductions of three orders of magnitude. Moreover, HHT antagonized the phosphorylation level of endogenous and exogenous eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (p-eIF4E), which might regulate the selective translation of specific messenger RNA (mRNA). HHT provides a starting point for further progress toward the clinical development of broad-spectrum antivirals.","publish_time":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Hui-Jun; Wang, Zhao-Hua; Meng, Wen; Li, Cui-Cui; Hu, Yan-Xin; Zhou, Lei; Wang, Xiao-Jia","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cdd0a62e95aebd067147c0fd81ec62dce46ad42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6266276.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266276/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HHT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HHT treatment","nM","inhibited avian influenza virus","Newcastle disease virus","inhibited infections of vesicular stomatitis virus","inhibited herpes simplex virus type","PEDV","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","RNA viruses","traditional antivirals","NDV-infected animals","potent antiviral action","effective antiviral activity","clinical development of broad-spectrum antivirals","selective translation of specific messenger RNA","exogenous eukaryotic initiation factor","VSV","host targets","phosphorylation level of endogenous","AIV","present high barriers","relieved severe symptoms","progress","resistance","natural compounds","HSV","viral load","p-eIF4E","mRNA","number of classes","reductions","concentrations","starting point","inhibitory concentration","replication","homoharringtonine","orders of magnitude","cell cultures","doses","study","work"],"language":"en"},

Since its discovery, tremendous efforts have been made to translate RNAi technology into therapeutic applications for the treatment of different human diseases including respiratory diseases, by manipulating the expression of disease-associated gene(s). Similar to other nucleic acid-based therapeutics, the major hurdle of RNAi therapy is delivery. Pulmonary delivery is a promising approach of delivering RNAi therapeutics directly to the airways for treating local conditions and minimizing systemic side effects. It is a non-invasive route of administration that is generally well accepted by patients. However, pulmonary drug delivery is a challenge as the lungs pose a series of anatomical, physiological and immunological barriers to drug delivery. Understanding these barriers is essential for the development an effective RNA delivery system. In this review, the different barriers to pulmonary drug delivery are introduced. The potential of RNAi molecules as new class of therapeutics, and the latest preclinical and clinical studies of using RNAi therapeutics in different respiratory conditions are discussed in details. We hope this review can provide some useful insights for moving inhaled RNAi therapeutics from bench to bedside.","publish_time":"2016-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Yingshan; Lam, Jenny K.

Its classical definition as the number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual in a fully susceptible population finds a clear analytical expression in homogeneous and stratified mixing models. Along with the generation time (the interval between primary and secondary cases), the reproduction number allows for the characterization of the dynamics of an epidemic. A clear-cut theoretical picture, however, is hardly found in real data. Here, we infer from highly detailed sociodemographic data two multiplex contact networks representative of a subset of the Italian and Dutch populations. We then simulate an infection transmission process on these networks accounting for the natural history of influenza and calibrated on empirical epidemiological data. We explicitly measure the reproduction number and generation time, recording all individual-level transmission events. We find that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number is untenable in realistic populations, and it does not provide any conceptual understanding of the epidemic evolution. This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral changes and other exogenous epidemiological determinants. Rather, it can be simply explained by the (clustered) contact structure of the population. Finally, we provide evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number can operationally be used to characterize the correct epidemic dynamics from incidence data.","publish_time":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Quan-Hui; Ajelli, Marco; Aleta, Alberto; Merler, Stefano; Moreno, Yamir; Vespignani, Alessandro","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/390dc3c6b8a82c69dddf3395e72846d49f5c4a72.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b322c2b004bb384ff72b6da2ee511e6b13792bc7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6294899.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6294899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["basic reproduction number","instantaneous reproduction number","number of secondary cases","incidence data","real data","empirical epidemiological data","classical theoretical picture","detailed sociodemographic data","generation time","classical definition","classical concept","correct epidemic dynamics","epidemic evolution","clear-cut theoretical picture","networks accounting","multiplex contact networks representative","susceptible population","contact structure","individual-level transmission events","realistic populations","conceptual understanding","Dutch populations","typical infected individual","exogenous epidemiological determinants","infection transmission process","conceptual cornerstones of mathematical epidemiology","clear analytical expression","subset","behavioral changes","stratified mixing models","natural history of influenza","interval","Italian","characterization","methodologies","departure","evidence"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the generalizability and validity of single nerve conduction studies (NCS) and muscle ultrasound testing to identify CIPNM, and we also assessed the ability of muscle ultrasound to prognosticate patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated medical, cardiac, surgical, and neurosurgical ICU patients. We performed weekly strength testing, NCS, electromyography (EMG), and muscle ultrasound. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and other test characteristics of single NCS and muscle ultrasound, and we used multivariable regression models to assess the prognostic ability of muscle ultrasound. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled. The incidence of probable CIPNM was 18% and did not differ significantly by type of ICU (p = 0.49). For diagnosing probable CIPNM, the peroneal motor NCS had a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71\u2013100%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI 82\u201396%), the sural sensory NCS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 80\u2013100%) and specificity of 42% (95% CI 31\u201354%), and abnormal muscle ultrasound echogenicity had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 48\u201398%) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 43\u201370%). Abnormal echogenicity was associated with reduced likelihood of discharge to home (9% vs 50%, p = 0.0001), fewer ICU-free days (median 3 (interquartile range 0\u201315) days vs 16 (9.3\u201319.3) days, p = 0.0002), and increased ICU mortality (42% vs 12%, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of critically ill patients, single NCS and muscle ultrasound achieved diagnostic accuracy for patients at risk for CIPNM. The routine utilization of these tests could be beneficial for all critically ill patients at risk for CIPNM.

The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general.","publish_time":"2018-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franzo, Giovanni; Cecchinato, Mattia; Tosi, Giovanni; Fiorentini, Laura; Faccin, Francesca; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Trogu, Tiziana; Barbieri, Ilaria; Massi, Paola; Moreno, Ana","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cfa11e4308af9ef83f7800b45f011139915cd43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6301571.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6301571/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Europe","South America","Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["IBV genotypes","Italy","patterns of GI","South America","epidemiology understanding","present study","Asia","HVR3 sequences","recent Italian GI","country diffusion","lineage","Q1 genotypes","practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge","poor molecular epidemiology data generation","specific case-study results","main nucleus","present days","main challenges","long time","unified nomenclature","backward viral flow","population dynamics","common origin unrecognized","classification","strains","Middle East","history","Europe","genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus","independent epidemiological pictures","multiple introduction events","Chinese ones","excellent example","development of effective vaccination strategies","lack","China","work","samples","available hypervariable region","ancestral viruses","S1 protein","collection","fact","control","misconceptions","HVR12","couple","beginning","century","pathogens","described scenario","shortcoming","emergence","misinterpretation","phylodynamic approach"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This was a multicenter study on consecutive patients who underwent ECMO across 16 hospitals in Korea. The records of all patients who required ECMO for acute respiratory failure between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed, and the utilization of ECMO was analyzed over time. RESULTS: During the study period, 5552 patients received ECMO in Korea as a whole, and a total of 2472 patients received ECMO at the participating 16 hospitals. We analyzed 487 (19.7%) patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure. The number of ECMO procedures provided for respiratory failure increased from 104 to 153 during the study period. The in-hospital survival rate increased from 30.8% to 35.9%. The use of prone positioning increased from 6.8% to 49.0% (p \u003C 0.001), and the use of neuromuscular blockers also increased from 28.2% to 58.2% (p \u003C 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that old age (OR 1.038 (95% CI 1.022, 1.054)), use of corticosteroid (OR 2.251 (95% CI 1.153, 4.397)), continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 2.196 (95% CI 1.135, 4.247)), driving pressure (OR 1.072 (95% CI 1.031, 1.114)), and prolonged ECMO duration (OR 1.020 (95% CI 1.003, 1.038)) were associated with increased odds of mortality.

The use of pre-ECMO prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers also increased during the same period.","publish_time":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baek, Moon Seong; Lee, Sang-Min; Chung, Chi Ryang; Cho, Woo Hyun; Cho, Young-Jae; Park, Sunghoon; Koo, So-My; Jung, Jae-Seung; Park, Seung Yong; Chang, Youjin; Kang, Byung Ju; Kim, Jung-Hyun; Oh, Jin Young; Park, So Hee; Yoo, Jung-Wan; Sim, Yun Su; Hong, Sang-Bum","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae56d60debc175395e6269fc5bf9184291e71a56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6318967.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6318967/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["utilization of ECMO","outcomes of ECMO","number of ECMO procedures","prolonged ECMO duration","CI","use of pre-ECMO prone positioning","consecutive patients","Korea","survival rates of patients","severe respiratory failure","acute respiratory failure","study period","increased odds of mortality","use of prone positioning","use of neuromuscular blockers","multicenter study","hospital survival rate","time","hospitals","utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Multiple regression analysis","old age","uses","changes","continuous renal replacement therapy","epidemiologic reports","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","technology","RESULTS","records","total","aim","pressure","corticosteroid"],"language":"en"},

Classically defined as an interferon-stimulated gene, expression of IFITM3 on cells is rapidly up-regulated in response to type I and II interferon. Here we found that IFITM3 is rapidly up-regulated by T cells following their activation and this occurred independently of type I and II interferon and the interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7. Up-regulation of IFITM3 on effector T cells protected these cells from virus infection and imparted a survival advantage at sites of virus infection. Our results show that IFITM3 expression on effector T cells is crucial for these cells to mediate their effector function and highlights an interferon independent pathway for the induction of IFITM3 which, if targeted, could be an effective approach to harness the activity of IFITM3 for infection prevention.","publish_time":"2019-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bedford, James G.; O\u2019Keeffe, Meredith; Reading, Patrick C.; Wakim, Linda M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51d3450393a2a698cfe8ae3e94cb9d8f556e43ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6334895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6334895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of IFITM3","IFITM3 expression","effector T cells","activity of IFITM3","induction of IFITM3","regulation of IFITM3","interferon independent pathway","interferon-stimulated gene","interferon regulatory factors","sites of virus infection","effector function","influenza virus","infection prevention","type","transmembrane protein","potent antiviral protein","cellular resistance","survival advantage","variety of pathogens","effective approach","activation","results","response"],"language":"en"},

In either case, administration or expression of recombinant proteins plays a fundamental role. mRNA prepared by in vitro transcription (IVT) is increasingly appreciated as a drug substance for delivery of recombinant proteins. With its biological role as transient carrier of genetic information translated into protein in the cytoplasm, therapeutic application of mRNA combines several advantages. For example, compared to transfected DNA, mRNA harbors inherent safety features. It is not associated with the risk of inducing genomic changes and potential adverse effects are only temporary due to its transient nature. Compared to the administration of recombinant proteins produced in bioreactors, mRNA allows supplying proteins that are difficult to manufacture and offers extended pharmacokinetics for short-lived proteins. Based on great progress in understanding and manipulating mRNA properties, efficacy data in various models have now demonstrated that IVT mRNA constitutes a potent and flexible platform technology. Starting with an introduction into passive immunotherapy, this review summarizes the current status of IVT mRNA technology and its application to such immunological interventions.","publish_time":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlake, Thomas; Thess, Andreas; Thran, Moritz; Jordan, Ingo","journal":"Cell Mol Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de79ddbf8cff4bf83533c1c991cf5640dab43ea5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6339677.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IVT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mRNA properties","therapeutic application of mRNA","administration of recombinant proteins","expression of recombinant proteins","delivery of recombinant proteins","supplying proteins","short-lived proteins","current status of IVT mRNA technology","mRNA harbors inherent safety features","body","passive immunotherapy","target-specific antibodies","target-specific receptors","biological role","fundamental role","immunological effectors","transient nature","immunological interventions","flexible platform technology","transient carrier of genetic information","transfected DNA","lasting immune response","review","lymphocytes","various models","bioreactors","efficacy data","potential adverse effects","genomic changes","understanding","cytoplasm","active immunization","extended pharmacokinetics","drug substance","great progress","risk","introduction","case","advantages","example","transcription"],"language":"en"},

We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to express the E7 antigen with an ER-targeting signal peptide (SP) plus an ER retention signal (KDEL sequence). In cell-culture experiments we demonstrated that this new E7 antigen, SP-E7-KDEL, targeted the ER. Infection of mice with this recombinant adenovirus that expresses SP-E7-KDEL showed interferon induction and tumour-protection response, similar to that provided by an adenovirus expressing the E7 antigen fused to CRT. This work demonstrated that just by adding a SP and the KDEL sequence, antigens can be targeted and retained in the ER with a consequent enhancement of immune response and tumour protection.

The present study aims to explore the effects of IPs for sex selection or sex selection drugs (SSDs) on pregnancy outcomes in rat models. SSDs contain Bryonia laciniosa, Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients. Methods An experimental design with successfully mated female rats were randomized into control and treatment groups. Phase 1 had 2 interventional arms while phase 2 had 3 interventional arms (12 rats/arm) besides control arm. In phase-1, pregnant females were dosed two SSDs(1000 mg/kg) on gestation days 1\u20135 whereas, in phase-2, on gestation days 6\u201319 to correlate the effect of the SSDs (500/1000/1500 mg/kg) consumption during different stages of pregnancy. Pregnant females were observed for clinical signs following treatment. The rats were sacrificed one day before expected day of delivery for evaluation. Pregnancy rate, gestation index, number of corpora lutea, and litter size were assessed. Foetuses were examined for sex, skeletal and soft tissue alterations. Discussion and conclusion In phase 1, no appreciable findings were there with SSD exposure. In phase 2, intrauterine growth and survival of foetuses were affected when SSDs were administered during organogenesis period.

Forty-three students were randomly classified into two groups, Kimchi (n = 21, supplemented with 100 g of Kimchi per day) or non-Kimchi (n = 22, supplemented with 100 g of radish per day, control) groups. During the four-week intervention period, students were asked to maintain their usual diet and activity, and instructed not to take any medications, functional food products, or dietary supplements. Anthropometrics, nutritional intake, and blood immune parameters (lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, and immunoglobulins) were measured before and after the four weeks of intervention. Thirty-nine students (19 in the Kimchi group, 20 in the non-Kimchi group) finished the study. After the intervention, no significant changes were observed in lymphocyte subsets (T-cell, B-cell, NK cell), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03B1), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and immunoglobulins (Ig A, G, and M) between groups in either the Kimchi or non-Kimchi.

However, the resulting chimeras induced a marginal TGEV-neutralizing antibody (Ab) response in mice. Here, with the view to improving this response, we introduced TGEV-C alone or in different tandem association with TGEV-A (A::C or C::A) in twelve putatively exposed regions of ClpG. Among the 28 resulting engineered proteins only 15, carrying up to 51 extra aa, had not essentially disturbed the correct CS31A fibrillae formation process. Six partially permissive sites accepting only TGEV-C and three highly permissive sites tolerating A::C or C::A tandem peptide, were identified throughout ClpG. Intact bacteria or extracted CS31A hybrid fibrillae expressing TGEV epitopes at any of the permissive sites, were recognized by Ab directed against the foreign parent protein, providing a direct argument for exposure of the corresponding ClpG region at the cell surface and for antigenicity of the epitopes in the polymeric CS31A fibrillae context. The potential of CS31A fibrillae as carriers of the TGEV peptides indicates that there may be three positions (N terminus, aa 202\u2013204 and 202\u2013218) in ClpG which may turn out to be important fusion sites and therefore be relevant for the eventual design of TGEV vaccines. Unexpectedly, TGEV-A, whatever its position in ClpG, mediated the partial proteolytic degradation of the hybrid proteins, suggesting that it functions as a substrate for a cellular protease, and thereby that its suitability as a vaccine antigen candidate is doubtful.","publish_time":"1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E9chin, Marie-Claire; Der Vartanian, Maurice; Martin, Christine","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b151730d74e21025def6ee80cd69132d3a4a2e21.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111996003484; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111996003484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-C","TGEV epitopes","TGEV-S","marginal TGEV","TGEV peptides","C epitope","CS31A hybrid fibrillae","region of ClpG","eventual design of TGEV vaccines","potential of CS31A fibrillae","permissive sites","polymeric CS31A fibrillae context","corresponding ClpG region","exposed regions of ClpG","correct CS31A fibrillae formation process","cell surface","B-cell epitopes","hybrid proteins","important fusion sites","response","spike S protein","tandem peptide","engineered proteins","resulting chimeras","surface of Escherichia coli","foreign parent protein","different tandem association","direct argument","entero-pathogenic transmissible gastroenteritis virus","partial proteolytic degradation","exposure","insertion","antibody","carriers","amino acids","suitability","vaccine antigen candidate","antigenicity","Intact bacteria","positions","N terminus","mice","cellular protease","substrate","view"],"language":"en"},

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is a major cause of allograft loss post-lung transplantation. Prior studies have examined the association between respiratory virus infection (RVI) and CLAD were limited by older diagnostic techniques, study design, and case numbers. We examined the association between symptomatic RVI and CLAD using modern diagnostic techniques in a large contemporary cohort of lung transplant recipients (LTRs). Methods. We retrospectively assessed clinical variables including acute rejection, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, upper and lower RVI, and the primary endpoint of CLAD (determined by 2 independent reviewers) in 250 LTRs in a single university transplantation program. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to analyze the relationship between RVI and CLAD in a time-dependent manner, incorporating different periods of risk following RVI diagnosis. Results. Fifty patients (20%) were diagnosed with CLAD at a median of 95 weeks post-transplantation, and 79 (32%) had 114 episodes of RVI. In multivariate analysis, rejection and RVI were independently associated with CLAD (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) 2.2 (1.2\u20133.9), P = .01 and 1.9 (1.1\u20133.5), P = .03, respectively. The association of RVI with CLAD was stronger the more proximate the RVI episode: 4.8 (1.9\u201311.6), P \u003C .01; 3.4 (1.5\u20137.5), P \u003C .01; and 2.4 (1.2\u20135.0), P = .02 in multivariate analysis for 3, 6, and 12 months following RVI, respectively. Conclusions. Symptomatic RVI is independently associated with development of CLAD, with increased risk at shorter time periods following RVI. Prospective studies to characterize the virologic determinants of CLAD and define the underlying mechanisms are warranted.","publish_time":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisher, Cynthia E.; Preiksaitis, Carl M.; Lease, Erika D.; Edelman, Jeffrey; Kirby, Katharine A.; Leisenring, Wendy M.; Raghu, Ganesh; Boeckh, Michael; Limaye, Ajit P.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fa779f7bacc1cfff3f11230c99c2966277cfb22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4706632.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/62/3/313/16789346/civ871.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26565010/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ871","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["association of RVI","symptomatic RVI","lower RVI","RVI diagnosis","RVI episode","episodes of RVI","development of CLAD","virologic determinants of CLAD","primary endpoint of CLAD","multivariate analysis","LTRs","weeks post-transplantation","major cause of allograft loss post-lung transplantation","Chronic lung allograft dysfunction","modern diagnostic techniques","different periods of risk","older diagnostic techniques","shorter time periods","multivariate Cox models","increased risk","acute rejection","single university transplantation program","Prospective studies","Prior studies","large contemporary cohort of lung transplant recipients","time-dependent manner","cytomegalovirus pneumonia","study design","respiratory virus infection","adjusted hazard ratio","clinical variables","median","confidence interval","case numbers","independent reviewers","underlying mechanisms","relationship","months","Background","Methods","Results","patients","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Adults admitted between 2000 and 2015 to 20 French ICUs with proven atypical pneumonia were retrospectively described. Patients with MP were compared to Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) pneumonia patients admitted to ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were included, 71 men and 33 women, with a median age of 56 [44\u201367] years. MP was the causative agent for 76 (73%) patients and CP for 28 (27%) patients. Co-infection was documented for 18 patients (viruses for 8 [47%] patients). Median number of involved quadrants on chest X-ray was 2 [1\u20134], with alveolar opacities (n = 61, 75%), interstitial opacities (n = 32, 40%). Extra-pulmonary manifestations were present in 34 (33%) patients. Mechanical ventilation was required for 75 (72%) patients and vasopressors for 41 (39%) patients. ICU length of stay was 16.5 [9.5\u201330.5] days, and 11 (11%) patients died in the ICU. Compared with SP patients, MP patients had more extensive interstitial pneumonia, fewer pleural effusion, and a lower mortality rate [6 (8%) vs. 17 (22%), p = 0.013]. According MCA analysis, some characteristics at admission could discriminate MP and SP. MP was more often associated with hemolytic anemia, abdominal manifestations, and extensive chest radiograph abnormalities. SP-P was associated with shock, confusion, focal crackles, and focal consolidation. CONCLUSION: In this descriptive study of atypical bacterial pneumonia requiring ICU admission, mortality was 11%.

Following intranasal inoculation, macaques shed minimal recombinant VSV (rVSV) in nasal washes for one day post-inoculation; viremia was not detected. Following intranasal inoculation of macaques, wild type (wt) VSV, rVSV, and two rVSV-HIV vectors showed no evidence of spread to CNS tissues. However, macaques inoculated intrathalamically with wt VSV developed severe neurological disease. One of four macaques receiving rVSV developed clinical and histological signs similar to the wt group, while the remaining three macaques in this group and all of the macaques in the rVSV-HIV vector groups showed no clinical signs of disease and reduced severity of histopathology compared to the wt group. The implications of these findings for rVSV vaccine development are discussed.","publish_time":"2007-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, J.

By performing alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have identified amino acid residues in nsp1\u03B1 and nsp1\u03B2 (the proteolytic products of nsp1) that when substituted with alanine(s) exhibited significant relief of IFN-suppression. A mutant virus (16-5A, in which residues 16\u201320 of nsp1\u03B2 were substituted with alanines) encoding mutant nsp1\u03B2 recovered from infectious cDNA clone was shown to be attenuated for growth in vitro and induced significantly higher amount of type I IFN transcripts in infected macrophages. In infected pigs, the 16-5A virus exhibited reduced growth at early times after infection but quickly regained wild type growth properties as a result of substitutions within the mutated sequences. The results indicate a strong selection pressure towards maintaining the IFN-inhibitory property of the virus for successful propagation in pigs.","publish_time":"2012-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beura, Lalit K.; Subramaniam, Sakthivel; Vu, Hiep L.X.; Kwon, Byungjoon; Pattnaik, Asit K.; Osorio, Fernando A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b372037e8fa20a9c417cd66089a478316bffd65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111991.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682212004151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22995188/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.08.034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212004151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutant virus","IFN transcripts","mutant nsp1\u03B2","infected pigs","inhibition of type","significant relief of IFN","IFN-inhibitory property","respiratory syndrome virus","wild type growth properties","reduced growth","infected macrophages","infected host","proteolytic products of nsp1","amino acid residues","infection","result of substitutions","nsp1\u03B1","early times","interferon","response","successful propagation","strong selection pressure","infectious cDNA clone","results","mutated sequences","mutagenesis","suppression","alanines","non-structural protein"],"language":"en"},

A questionnaire was mailed in 1997 to all pilots in a Scandinavian airline company (N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. The same questionnaire was sent to the participants 3 years later, 436 participated (76%). There were questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms and infections, allergies, the cabin environment, psychosocial environment and the home environment. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The incidence of doctors\u2019 diagnosed asthma and atopy were 2.4 and 16.6 per 1000 person years, respectively. Pilots changing type of flight during follow-up got more airway infections (OR = 11.27; 95% CI 2.39\u201353.14). Those reporting decreased work control (OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.03\u20133.31 for 1 unit change) and those with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home (OR = 3.73; 95% CI 1.09\u201312.83) had a higher incidence of atopy during follow up. Dampness or mould at home was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 3.55; 95% CI 1.43\u20138.82) and airway infections (OR = 3.12 95% CI 1.27\u20137.68). Window pane condensation in winter at home, reported at baseline, was associated with increased incidence of asthma symptoms (OR = 4.14; 95% CI 1.32\u201312.97) and pilots living in newer buildings at baseline had a higher incidence of airway infections (OR = 5.23; 95% CI 1.43\u201319.10). In conclusion, lack of work control and ETS at home can be a risk factors for development of allergic symptoms in pilots. Window pane condensation at home can be a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Dampness and mould at home can be a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections and living in newer buildings can be a risk factor for incidence of airway infections.","publish_time":"2016-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Xi; Lindgren, Torsten; Wieslander, Gunilla; Janson, Christer; Norb\u00E4ck, Dan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c4acd1676d614bf6b2e4fdf9d17337e237d440d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5065138.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741314/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ETS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["home environment","higher incidence of airway infections","increased incidence of asthma symptoms","higher prevalence of asthma symptoms","higher incidence of atopy","respiratory symptoms","incidence of doctors\u2019","incidence of respiratory health","development of allergic symptoms","risk factors","psychosocial environment","cabin environment","baseline","newer buildings","ETS","lack of work control","Window pane condensation","associations","decreased work control","history of atopy","y cohort of commercial pilots","mould","Dampness","questionnaire","person years","allergies","multiple logistic regression","winter","follow-up","environmental tobacco smoke","odds ratios","Scandinavian airline company","type of flight","unit change","conclusion","participants","questions","aim","confidence intervals"],"language":"en"}]}

Although the balance between two proteins functions has been found to be crucial for viral fitness, the interplay between the proteins has not been well established. Herein we present evidence for interplay between influenza HA and NA, which may affect the balance between two glycoprotein functions. NA enzymatic activities against sialoglycans were promoted by the presence of HA, which is in accordance with the level of co-existing HA. Such activity enhancement was lost when the HA-receptor binding properties were abolished by low-pH treatment or by mutations at the HA receptor binding domain. Sialidase activities of NA-containing virus-like particles and native influenza viruses were detected using different NA-assays and sialic acid substrates. Most pronounced HA-mediated NA enhancement was found when intact virions were confronted with multivalent surface-anchored substrates, which mimics the physiological conditions on cell membranes. Using recombinant viruses with altered HA bindings preference between \u03B12,3- and \u03B12,6-linked sialic acids, we also found that NA function against different substrates is correlated with the HA-receptor specificity. The effect of HA-receptor specificities on NA functions, together with the HA-mediated NA enhancement, may play a role in virus evasion of the mucus barrier, as well as in cross-species adaptation. Our data also indicate the importance of using multivalent substrates in future studies of NA functions.","publish_time":"2019-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Jimmy Chun Cheong; Karunarathna, Herath M.

Anticoronavirus therapy is however challenging, as coronaviruses are biologically diverse and rapidly mutating. In this work, the antiviral activity of seven different carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for the treatment of human coronavirus HCoV-229E infections was investigated. The first generation of antiviral CQDs was derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid as carbon precursors and postmodified with boronic acid ligands. These nanostructures showed a concentration-dependent virus inactivation with an estimated EC(50) of 52 \u00B1 8 \u03BCg mL(\u20131). CQDs derived from 4-aminophenylboronic acid without any further modification resulted in the second-generation of anti-HCoV nanomaterials with an EC(50) lowered to 5.2 \u00B1 0.7 \u03BCg mL(\u20131). The underlying mechanism of action of these CQDs was revealed to be inhibition of HCoV-229E entry that could be due to interaction of the functional groups of the CQDs with HCoV-229E entry receptors; surprisingly, an equally large inhibition activity was observed at the viral replication step.","publish_time":"2019-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u0141oczechin, Aleksandra; S\u00E9ron, Karin; Barras, Alexandre; Giovanelli, Emerson; Belouzard, Sandrine; Chen, Yen-Ting; Metzler-Nolte, Nils; Boukherroub, Rabah; Dubuisson, Jean; Szunerits, Sabine","journal":"ACS Applied Materials \u0026 Interfaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a51e2b482e1043d3ef7279a936667971c57b313.json; document_parses/pdf_json/af674b65ddf992e5f77b5198b6be6e8c728c21c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7075527.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633330/; https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.9b15032; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b15032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of HCoV","generation of antiviral CQDs","treatment of human coronavirus HCoV","E infections","citric acid","antiviral activity","second-generation of anti-HCoV nanomaterials","aminophenylboronic acid","E entry receptors","\u03BCg","pathogenic human coronavirus","boronic acid ligands","large inhibition activity","carbon precursors","estimated EC","different carbon quantum dots","hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine","Therapeutic options","concentration-dependent virus inactivation","modification","functional groups","Image","text","nanostructures","viral replication step","interaction","underlying mechanism of action","coronaviruses","work","Anticoronavirus therapy"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the BES has been used for the production of recombinant proteins and the construction of virus-like particles (VLPs), as well as for the development of subunit vaccines, including VLP-based vaccines. The VLP, which consists of one or more structural proteins but no viral genome, resembles the authentic virion but cannot replicate in cells. The high-quality recombinant protein expression and post-translational modifications obtained with the BES, along with its capacity to produce multiple proteins, imply that it is ideally suited to VLP production.

GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells.

Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored.

Juss.) Roem. (TSL), a popular vegetable in China, have anti-inflammatory, antidoting, and worm-killing effects and are used in folk medicine for the treatment of enteritis, dysentery, carbuncles, boils, and especially abdominal tumors. Our aim was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and anticancer property of the essential oil from TSL (TSL-EO), especially the pro-apoptotic effect in SGC-7901. Materials and methods TSL-EO obtained by hydrodistillation was analyzed by GC/MS and was tested in vitro against twenty clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus (SA 1\u201320), which were either methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two standard strains viz. ATCC 25923 and ATCC 43300. The anticancer activity of TSL-EO was evaluated in vitro against HepG2, SGC7901, and HT29 through MTT assay. Moreover, the apoptosis-inducing activity of TSL-EO in SGC7901 cells was determined by Hoechst 33324 staining and flow cytometry methods. Also, the apoptosis-related proteins viz. Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were detected by western-blotting. Results GC\u2013MS analysis showed that TSL-EO contained a high amount of sesquiterpenes (84.64%), including copaene (8.27%), \u03B2-caryophyllene (10.16%), caryophyllene (13.18%) and \u03B2-eudesmene (5.06%). TSL-EO inhibited the growth of both MSSA and MRSA, with the lowest MIC values of 0.125 and 1mg/ml, respectively. Treatment with TSL-EO for 24h could significantly suppress the viability of three different cancer cell lines (P\u003C0.05). Furthermore, the apoptosis-inducing activity of TSL-EO in SGC7901 cells increased in a dose-dependent manner, potentially resulting from the up-regulated expression of Bax, caspase-3 and down-regulated expression of Bcl-2. Conclusions TSL-EO possessed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and significant cytotoxicity against cancer cells and particularly prominent pro-apoptotic activity in SGC7901 cells. These bioactivities were probably due to the high content of sesquiterpenes. Our results suggested that TSL-EO possessed potential health benefits and could serve as a promising natural food addictive.","publish_time":"2014-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Jian-Guo; Peng, Wei; Yi, Jun; Wu, Yan-Bin; Chen, Ti-Qiang; Wong, Ka-Hing; Wu, Jin-Zhong","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9075c9e8a54e688ca3ec5c27b13470f569535d7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126815.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874114002761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726685/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114002761","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATCC","MTT","Hoechst","MSSA","MIC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["methods TSL-EO","Conclusions TSL-EO","anticancer activity of TSL","SGC7901 cells","antibacterial activity","antimicrobial activity","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus","isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus","cancer cells","prominent pro-apoptotic activity","MRSA","MSSA","caspase","regulated expression of Bax","ATCC","regulated expression of Bcl","Results GC","\u03B2-caryophyllene","pro-apoptotic effect","apoptosis-related proteins","high content of sesquiterpenes","anticancer property","treatment of enteritis","standard strains","MS analysis","\u03B2-eudesmene","flow cytometry methods","different cancer cell lines","significant cytotoxicity","Hoechst","essential oil","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Leaves of Toona sinensis","boils","carbuncles","viability","staining","hydrodistillation","potential health benefits","folk medicine","dysentery","HT29","growth","lowest MIC values","promising natural food addictive","effects","Juss","dose-dependent manner","MTT assay","popular vegetable","HepG2","Materials","abdominal tumors","China","western-blotting","worm","aim","copaene","bioactivities","Roem"],"language":"en"},

Molecular assays have generally been evaluated by comparing them to conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or viral culture techniques, with few published direct comparisons between molecular methods or between institutions. We sought to perform a real-world comparison of two molecular respiratory viral diagnostic methods between two experienced respiratory virus research laboratories. METHODS: We tested nasal and throat swab specimens obtained from 225 infants with respiratory illness for 11 common respiratory viruses using both a multiplex assay (Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay [RMA]) and individual real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). RESULTS: Both assays detected viruses in more than 70% of specimens, but there was discordance. The RMA assay detected significantly more human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while RT-rtPCR detected significantly more influenza A. We speculated that primer differences accounted for these discrepancies and redesigned the primers and probes for influenza A in the RMA assay, and for HMPV and RSV in the RT-rtPCR assay. The tests were then repeated and again compared. The new primers led to improved detection of HMPV and RSV by RT-rtPCR assay, but the RMA assay remained similar in terms of influenza detection. CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of a gold standard, clinical and research laboratories should regularly correlate the results of molecular assays with other PCR based assays, other laboratories, and with standard virologic methods to ensure consistency and accuracy.","publish_time":"2011-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, S Asad; Gern, James E; Hartert, Tina V; Edwards, Kathryn M; Griffin, Marie R; Miller, E Kathryn; Gebretsadik, Tebeb; Pappas, Tressa; Lee, Wai- ming; Williams, John V","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a0cbd4cb08c862deadcb5aaef22a27b770c0791.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3154182.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21714915/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RMA","HMPV","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RMA assay","RT-rtPCR assay","molecular methods","respiratory illness","molecular respiratory viral diagnostic methods","Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay","multiplex assay","results of molecular assays","viral respiratory infections","respiratory syncytial virus","common respiratory viruses","experienced respiratory virus research laboratories","RSV","individual real-time RT-PCR","standard virologic methods","improved detection of HMPV","Molecular polymerase chain reaction","terms of influenza detection","viral culture techniques","gold standard","new primers","published direct comparisons","throat swab specimens","conventional direct fluorescent antibody","DFA","infants","human metapneumovirus","conduct epidemiology studies","real-world comparison","discrepancies","absence","BACKGROUND","consistency","probes","primer differences","accuracy","institutions","CONCLUSIONS","discordance","tests"],"language":"en"},

To develop an in vivo model of PRV infection, an inbred C3H mouse strain was infected intranasally with pathogenic PRV strain Miyazaki-Bali/2007. C3H mice suffered severe lung infection with significant body weight reduction and died within 7 days after intranasal infection. Infectious viruses were isolated mainly from the lungs and trachea. Histopathological examination revealed interstitial pneumonia with monocytes infiltration. Following repeated intranasal infection, mice developed antibodies to particular structural and non-structural proteins of PRV. The results of these immunological assays will help to develop laboratory protocols for sero-epidemiological studies.

The MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccine produced high titer anti-S neutralizing antibody and protected mice from MERS-CoV infection in vivo.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coleman, Christopher M.; Venkataraman, Thiagarajan; Liu, Ye V.; Glenn, Gregory M.; Smith, Gale E.; Flyer, David C.; Frieman, Matthew B.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44f29967d1ac81b105a6e60032f9dafb0894f3ab.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a7960070f97e42542f5a3a758e454edffc32ad89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5423355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237499/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17301937; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17301937","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV spike","MERS-CoV infection","anti-MERS-CoV vaccines","recombinant MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccine","S protein","high titer anti-S neutralizing antibody","protected mice","neutralizing antibodies","receptor binding","Matrix-M1 adjuvant combination","ideal target","virion entry","cells","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","immunodominant","vaccinations","approved therapeutics","protection","infections","deaths","study"],"language":"en"},

Whether symptomatic viral infections of the lower respiratory tract are causal in asthma development or simply identify predisposed children remains a controversial issue. Wheezing illnesses caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), particularly those severe enough to lead to hospitalization, have historically been associated with an increased risk of asthma at school age.

After binding to their specific receptor on the cell surface, viruses (or viral genomes) have to enter cells to initiate a productive infection. Though the entry processes of many enveloped viruses is well understood, that of most non-enveloped viruses still remains unresolved. Recent studies have shown that compared to direct fusion at the plasma membrane, endocytosis is more often the preferred means of entry into the target cell. Receptor-mediated endocytic pathways such as the dynamin-dependent clathrin and caveolar pathways are well characterized as viral entry portals. However, many viruses are able to utilize multiple uptake pathways. Fluid phase uptake, though relatively non-specific in terms of its cargo, potentially aids viral infection by its ability to intersect with the endocytic pathway. In fact, many viruses despite using specialized pathways for entry are still able to generate productive infection via fluid phase uptake. Macropinocytosis, a major fluid uptake pathway found in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, is stimulated by growth factor receptors. Many viruses can induce these signaling cascades in cells leading to macropinocytosis. Though endocytic trafficking is utilized by both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, key differences lie in the way membranes are traversed to deposit the viral genome at its site of replication. This review will discuss recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of viral entry.","publish_time":"2009-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalia, Manjula; Jameel, Shahid","journal":"Amino Acids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f870db16a7635ced7a129a360a591017490565ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088018.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19826903/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-009-0363-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-enveloped viruses","viral infection","viral entry portals","entry processes","endocytic pathways","multiple uptake pathways","Fluid phase uptake","evolving field of viral entry","viral genomes","major fluid uptake pathway","caveolar pathways","specialized pathways","productive infection","preferred means of entry","epithelial cells","cell surface","target cell","host cell","Macropinocytosis","endocytic trafficking","site of replication","specific receptor","recent developments","Recent studies","complex cellular processes","key differences","endocytosis","fibroblasts","dynamin-dependent clathrin","direct fusion","plasma membrane","cargo","ability","way membranes","composition","terms","cascades","growth factor receptors","structure","review","binding"],"language":"en"},

The spread of the virus was ultimately controlled by isolation of infected individuals and there has been no infections reported since April 2004. However, the natural reservoir of the virus was never identified and it is not known if this virus will re-emerge and, therefore, research on this virus continues. The SARS-CoV genome is about 30 kb in length and is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs). The genome encodes for proteins that are homologous to known coronavirus proteins, such as the replicase proteins (ORFs 1a and 1b) and the four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E). SARS-CoV also encodes for eight unique proteins, called accessory proteins, with no known homologues.

With purified [22P]N as substrate it was demonstrated that this PPPase, distinguishable from acid and alkaline phosphatases, acts optimally at neutral pH in the presence of Mn2\u002B following treatment with a detergent. Complete inhibition with okadaic acid at 0.9\u20134.5 \u03BCM but not at 1\u201310 nM relegates this PPase to a type I protein phosphatase.

Data Sources Key historical articles, articles highlighted in our recent review of most significant recent asthma advancements, and findings from several birth cohorts related to asthma and viral infections were reviewed. In addition, PubMed was searched for review articles and original research related to the associations between viral infection and asthma, using the search words asthma, viral infections, atopy, development of asthma, rhinovirus (RV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Study Selections Articles were selected based on novelty and relevance to our topic of interest, the role of asthma and viral infections, and possible mechanisms to explain the association. Results There is a large body of evidence demonstrating a link between early viral infections (especially RV and RSV) and asthma inception and exacerbations. RV-induced wheezing is an important risk factor for asthma only when atopy is present, with much evidence supporting the idea that sensitization is a risk factor for early RV-induced wheezing, which in turn is a risk factor for asthma. RSV, on the other hand, is a more important risk factor for nonatopic asthma, with severe infections conferring greater risk. Conclusion There are important differences in the development of atopic and nonatopic asthma, with several proposed mechanisms explaining the association between viral infections and the development of asthma and asthma exacerbations. Understanding these complex associations is important for developing asthma prevention strategies and targeted asthma therapies.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mikhail, Irene; Grayson, Mitchell H.","journal":"Annals of Allergy, Asthma \u0026 Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6a2d360c66488cd0e599c35b73ed8dcf4eb3077.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111180.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1081120619304648; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1081120619304648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276807/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2019.06.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of asthma","nonatopic asthma","asthma exacerbations","asthma inception","role of asthma","asthma prevention strategies","search words asthma","targeted asthma therapies","early viral infections","significant recent asthma advancements","important risk factor","severe infections","atopy","review articles","greater risk","RSV","early RV-induced wheezing","important differences","complex associations","recent review","development of atopic","Study Selections Articles","Data Sources Key historical articles","available data","proposed mechanisms","possible mechanisms","large body of evidence","findings","link","sensitization","birth cohorts","rhinovirus","turn","original research","respiratory syncytial virus","novelty","idea","Abstract Objective","PubMed","hand","relevance","Results","addition","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Data from 2,740 calves, originating from 16 French farms and observed from birth until 30 d of age, were analyzed using models that took account of direct genetic, maternal genetic, and common environmental effects. Both direct and maternal genetic parameters were estimated for birth weight (BW), calving ease (CE), neonatal vitality (NV), survival at 30 d (Surv), and umbilical infection and diarrhea at different ages (0 to 5 d: Umb1 and Diar1; 6 to 20 d: Umb2 and Diar2; and 21 to 30 d: Umb3 and Diar3). The heritability values for direct and maternal genetic effects were, 0.026 (SE = 0.027) and 0.096 (SE = 0.042) for Surv, 0.280 (SE = 0.063) and 0.063 (SE = 0.038) for BW, 0.129 (SE = 0.041) and 0 for CE, 0.073 (SE = 0.035) and 0 for NV, 0.071 (SE = 0.038) and 0.017 (SE = 0.026) for Umb1, 0 and 0.082 (SE = 0.029) for Umb2, 0 and 0.044 (SE = 0.030) for Diar1, 0.016 (SE = 0.022) and 0.012 (SE = 0.026) for Diar2, and 0.016 (SE = 0.028) and 0 for Diar3, respectively. Significant genetic variability in beef cattle was thus revealed for five calf health traits: NV, Surv, Diar1, Umb1, and Umb2. In addition, for three traits (Surv, Diar1, and Umb2), maternal genetic effects clearly contributed more to health performance than direct genetic effects. Estimates of genetic correlation between traits varied markedly (from 0 to 1 in absolute values) depending on the traits in question, the age for a given trait, and the type (direct or maternal) of the genetic effects considered. These results suggest that not all health traits in Charolais cattle can be improved simultaneously, and breeders will therefore have to prioritize certain traits of interest in their breeding objectives. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential utility of collecting and integrating data on calf diseases, NV and survival in future beef cattle breeding programs. To ensure appropriate biological and genetic evaluations of calf health performance, it is important to accurately describe the phenotypes for diarrhea and umbilical infections (in terms of age ranges) and account for maternal genetic and common environmental effects that explain calf health performance traits. Further investigation and improved data collection are now necessary to maximize the efficiency of breeding schemes designed to simultaneously improve production and health traits.","publish_time":"2018-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vinet, A; Leclerc, H; Marquis, F; Phocas, F","journal":"Journal of Animal Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edf7369ab23f90033817e875989d2fefdba985b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6140890.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471383/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky043; https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/96/4/1246/25759681/sky043.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maternal genetic effects","direct genetic effects","calf health traits","maternal genetic parameters","account of direct genetic","calf health performance traits","genetic evaluations of calf health performance","certain traits","Significant genetic variability","Estimates of genetic correlation","d of age","Diar1","Umb2","common environmental effects","survival","calf diseases","Charolais cattle","Umb1","future beef cattle breeding programs","diarrhea","breeding objectives","BW","improved data collection","Diar2","results","Diar3","terms of age ranges","efficiency of breeding schemes","umbilical infections","birth weight","heritability values","absolute values","calving ease","neonatal vitality","different ages","phenotypes","given trait","factors","production","models","French farms","calves","potential utility","investigation","question","study","Umb3","addition","breeders"],"language":"en"},

To undertake basic research and therapeutic development, many of these viruses require handling by highly trained staff in BSL-3/4 facilities not readily available to the majority of the global R\u0026D community. In order to circumvent the enhanced biosafety requirement, the development of non-pathogenic, replication-defective pseudotyped viruses is an effective and established solution to permit the study of many aspects of virus biology in a low containment biosafety level (BSL)-1/2 laboratory. Under the spectre of the unfolding Ebola crisis, this timely conference (the second to be organised by the Viral Pseudotype Unit, www.viralpseudotypeunit.info*) discusses the recent advances in pseudotype technology and how it is revolutionizing the study of important human and animal pathogens (human and avian influenza viruses, rabies/lyssaviruses, HIV, Marburg and Ebola viruses). Key topics addressed in this conference include the exploitation of pseudotypes for serology and serosurveillance, immunogenicity testing of current and next-generation vaccines and new pseudotype assay formats (multiplexing, kit development). *The first pseudotype-focused Euroscicon conference organised by the Viral Pseudotype Unit was recently reviewed [1].","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bentley, Emma M.; Mather, Stuart T.; Temperton, Nigel J.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cf83ad3d6853a05b06c503b57d12d3a2e0c65cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127415.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25936665/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15005472; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15005472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral Pseudotype Unit","Ebola viruses","pseudotype technology","pseudotype-focused Euroscicon conference","avian influenza viruses","development of non-pathogenic","study of important human","new pseudotype assay formats","BSL","human behaviour","kit development","therapeutic development","timely conference","replication-defective pseudotyped viruses","animal pathogens","emergence of different viral diseases","enhanced biosafety requirement","animal health importance","unfolding Ebola crisis","low containment biosafety level","lyssaviruses","rabies","generation vaccines","serosurveillance","multiplexing","HIV","aspects of virus biology","majority","serology","immunogenicity testing of current","facilities","climates","trained staff","Marburg","global R","great public","exploitation of pseudotypes","established solution","international travel","demographics","handling","world\u0027s economies","D community","recent advances","order","spectre","basic research","globalization","laboratory","Key topics"],"language":"en"},

We compared information on asking prices and what species were traded using two comparative approaches to analyze how species composition may have changed over time (physical markets and online platforms; pre-Internet and Internet era). In comparison with the five previous market surveys, we did not find a statistically significant difference between species and availability of species offered for sale when comparing physical bird markets and online markets. In all data sets, biological factors such as wingspan were significant factors in explaining price variation.

Multiplex molecular detection methods have recently been investigated in hope of replacing these traditional techniques with rapid panel\u2010based testing. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the FilmArray(\u00AE) Respiratory Panel ([FARP], Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) as a replacement for direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing in a pediatric hospital. METHODS: Eleven of the 21 FARP analytes (Adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A, Influenza A H1N1 2009, Influenza B, Parainfluenza [1, 2, \u0026 3], Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and rhinovirus) were evaluated using nasopharyngeal specimens. Positive samples were pooled in groups of 5. Samples identified by reference methods as positive for respiratory pathogens were used for the majority of positive samples. DFA was the reference method for ten analytes; Luminex(TM) xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) was the reference method for rhinovirus. Discrepant results were resolved by positive culture and fluorescent antibody stain and/or laboratory\u2010developed real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (LDT). RESULTS: The agreement for most analytes was in concordance with the established reference methods with the exception of Adenovirus. Additionally, the FARP detected several pathogens not previously detected by DFA, and most were confirmed by LDT. Several DFA\u2010positive analytes were confirmed as true\u2010negatives by the FARP and LDT. CONCLUSION: FARP overall performed better than DFA with the exception of Adenovirus, making the FARP an attractive alternative to laboratories looking to replace DFA with a rapid, user\u2010friendly, multiplex molecular assay.

In this review, we primarily survey human host-virus interaction data that are available from public databases following the standardized PSI-MS format. Notably, available host-virus protein interaction information is strongly biased toward a small number of virus families including herpesviridae, papillomaviridae, orthomyxoviridae and retroviridae. While we explore the reliability and relevance of these protein interactions we also survey the current knowledge about viruses functional and topological targets. Furthermore, we assess emerging frontiers of host-virus protein interaction research, focusing on protein interaction interfaces of hosts that are infected by different viruses and viruses that infect multiple hosts. Finally, we cover the current status of research that investigates the relationships of virus-targeted host proteins to other comorbidities as well as the influence of host-virus protein interactions on human metabolism.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodacre, Norman; Devkota, Prajwal; Bae, Eunhae; Wuchty, Stefan; Uetz, Peter","journal":"Seminars in Cell \u0026 Developmental Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d2e8e37b270fd1a943d27d9d6014237e5f31d56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102568.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1084952117304998; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952117304998; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2018.07.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-host interaction interfaces","virus protein interactions","virus protein interaction research","human host-virus interaction data","available host-virus protein interaction information","relationships of virus","influence of host","protein interaction interfaces of hosts","targeted host proteins","emerging frontiers of host","human hosts","small number of virus families","viruses functional","different viruses","Abstract Viruses","series of interactions","current knowledge","human metabolism","multiple hosts","current status of research","detailed knowledge","understanding of viral infection mechanisms","disease etiology","herpesviridae","public databases","papillomaviridae","standardized PSI-MS format","topological targets","development of new drugs","orthomyxoviridae","comorbidities","retroviridae","reliability","relevance","review"],"language":"en"},

In the meantime, however, metagenomic sequencing efforts are revealing enteric viruses as the most abundant dimension of the intestinal gut ecosystem, and the first gut virome-wide association studies showed that inflammatory bowel disease as well as type 1 diabetes could be linked to the presence or absence of particular viral inhabitants in the intestine. In line with the genetic component of these human diseases, mouse model studies demonstrated how beneficial functions of a resident virus can switch to detrimental inflammatory effects in a genetically predisposed host. Such viral-induced intestinal immune disturbances are also recapitulated by several gastrointestinal infectious viruses such as rotavirus and human norovirus. This wide range of viral effects on intestinal immunity emphasizes the need for understanding the innate immune responses to gastrointestinal viruses. Numerous nucleic acid sensors such as DexD/H helicases and AIM2 serve as cytosolic viral guardians to induce antiviral interferon and/or pro-inflammatory inflammasome responses. In both cases, pioneering examples are emerging in which RNA helicases cooperate with particular Nod-like receptors to trigger these cellular responses to enteric viruses. Here we summarize the reported beneficial versus detrimental effects of enteric viruses in the intestinal immune system, and we zoom in on the mechanisms through which sensing of nucleic acids from these enteric viruses trigger interferon and inflammasome responses.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dubois, Hanne; van Loo, Geert; Wullaert, Andy","journal":"International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30301bcd3567e19053512074c2448762cc032e1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104954.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193764481830087X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30904192/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.08.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S193764481830087X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DexD/H"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gastrointestinal viruses","detrimental effects of enteric viruses","gastrointestinal infectious viruses","detrimental inflammatory effects","wide range of viral effects","intestinal gut ecosystem","intestinal immune disturbances","intestinal immune system","innate immune responses","intestinal immunity","pro-inflammatory inflammasome responses","cellular responses","undisputed far-reaching effects","cytosolic viral guardians","gastrointestinal tract","absence of particular viral inhabitants","gut bacterial","gut virome-wide association studies","inflammatory bowel disease","antiviral interferon","beneficial functions","H helicases","human diseases","RNA helicases","particular Nod","human norovirus","nucleic acids","host health","predisposed host","mouse model studies","Numerous nucleic acid sensors","DexD","AIM2","need","abundant dimension","resident virus","presence","fungal communities","metagenomic sequencing efforts","rotavirus","genetic component","type","receptors","pioneering examples","diabetes","meantime","intestine","line","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system.

Feline coronavirus (FCoV) genomic RNA was detected consistently in this study in biologic samples from adult cats, kittens suffering from FIP, and their siblings. Analysis of viral 7a/7b open reading frame (ORFs) were analyzed and revealed two distinct virus variants circulating in the population, one with an intact 7a ORF and one with two major deletions in the 7a ORF. The 7b ORFs were intact and similar among all virus isolates, although point mutations resulting in amino acid changes were present. The sire was determined to be infected with both variants, and was persistently virus-infected.

Over the past few years there has been increasing evidence that different components of the TJs can be hijacked by viruses in order to complete their infectious cycle. Viruses from at least nine different families of DNA and RNA viruses have been reported to use TJ proteins in their benefit. For example, TJ proteins such as JAM-A or some members of the claudin family of proteins are used by members of the Reoviridae family and hepatitis C virus as receptors or co-receptors during their entry into their host cells. Reovirus, in addition, takes advantage of the TJ protein Junction Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A) to achieve its hematogenous dissemination. Some other viruses are capable of regulating the expression or the localization of TJ proteins to induce cell transformation or to improve the efficiency of their exit process. This review encompasses the importance of TJs for viral entry, replication, dissemination, and egress, and makes a clear statement of the importance of studying these proteins to gain a better understanding of the replication strategies used by viruses that infect epithelial and/or endothelial cells.","publish_time":"2015-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres-Flores, Jes\u00FAs M.; Arias, Carlos F.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48c20fe82a21edeefb8e1966189db32213a446fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4584309.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7092865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["localization of TJ proteins","RNA viruses","claudin family of proteins","importance of TJs","epithelial cells","members","JAM","host cells","endothelial cells","TJ protein Junction Adhesion Molecule","co-receptors","Reoviridae family","cell transformation","viral entry","replication strategies","different components","hematogenous dissemination","establishment of cell polarity","different families of DNA","hepatitis C virus","advantage","paracellular space","specialized membrane domains","regulation","important cellular processes","expression","passage of ions","macromolecules","efficiency","egress","evidence","better understanding","clear statement","addition","order","example","infectious cycle","Tight junctions","years","exit process","Reovirus","review","benefit","past"],"language":"en"},

We recently reported that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with BV stimulated antitumor immunity. The recombinant BV (rBV) also strongly stimulated peptide-specific T-cells and antitumor immunity. In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated. RESULTS: We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC II-binding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8(\u002B) T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) induced antitumor immunity, paving the way for its use in BV immunotherapy against malignancies.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kondou, Keigo; Suzuki, Tomoyuki; Chang, Myint Oo; Takaku, Hiroshi","journal":"J Biol Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00b88130d2a7c8489e209742494303b6731d7544.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6805443.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13036-019-0207-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BV","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rBV","recombinant BV","BV immunotherapy","EG7-OVA tumors","wild-type BV","antitumor immunity","FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups","EG7-OVA tumor mouse models","fragment C-ovalbumin","stimulated peptide-specific T-cells","insect cells","dendritic cells","induced tumors","RESULTS","recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine","significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic","p30-ovalbumin","tumor volume","immune response","promiscuous MHC","mediated response","posttranslational modification ability","Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus","therapeutic vaccinations","mice","low clinical risks","tetanus toxin","benefits","numerous protein expression systems","binding sequence","useful vaccination vector","stimulation","increased survival","CD8","Experiments","DCs","addition","malignancies","findings","wtBV","study","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","pathway","controls"],"language":"en"},

The viruses in severe pneumonia remain poorly defined. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban City, Philippines from May 2008 to May 2009. Patients aged 8 days to 13 years old who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics with severe pneumonia were enrolled for the study. Upon admission, polymerase chain reaction was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs and blood cultures to detect respiratory viruses and bacteria, respectively. RESULT: Among the 819 patients enrolled, at least one virus was detected in 501 cases (61.2%). In addition, 423 cases were positive for a single virus while bacteria were detected in the blood culture sample of 31 cases. The most commonly detected viruses were human rhinoviruses (n = 189), including types A (n = 103), B (n = 17), and C (n = 69), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 165). Novel viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus NL63, human bocavirus, and human polyomaviruses WU and KI were also detected. There were 70 deaths, and one or more viruses were detected in 35 (50%) of these cases. Positivity only for influenza A virus (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.3-14.6) was significantly associated with fatal outcome. From the blood culture, Burkholderia cepacia group (n = 9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 1), and Salmonella C1 (n = 1) were also isolated. CONCLUSION: Viruses were commonly detected in children with severe pneumonia in the Philippines. Hence, viral etiologies should be considered while developing better effective strategies to reduce child pneumonia-related deaths in developing countries.","publish_time":"2012-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzuki, Akira; Lupisan, Socorro; Furuse, Yuki; Fuji, Naoko; Saito, Mariko; Tamaki, Raita; Galang, Hazel; Sombrero, Lydia; Mondoy, Melisa; Aniceto, Rapunzel; Olveda, Remigio; Oshitani, Hitoshi","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/417fd2b2eba2473029f35d664f1bc72e03022eb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3519714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23092190/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia","WU","Streptococcus","Salmonella C1"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Philippines"],"keyphrases":["detected viruses","severe pneumonia","respiratory viruses","cases","Novel viruses","human bocavirus","human metapneumovirus","human rhinoviruses","child pneumonia-related deaths","developing countries","single virus","human coronavirus NL63","human polyomaviruses WU","respiratory syncytial virus","blood cultures","blood culture sample","bacteria","Philippines","study","Patients","leading cause of child death","Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center","Tacloban City","nasopharyngeal swabs","Burkholderia cepacia group","polymerase chain reaction","RSV","children","effective strategies","Department of Pediatrics","admission","years old","days","KI","BACKGROUND","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Staphylococcus aureus","Haemophilus influenzae","Salmonella C1","Positivity","addition","types","fatal outcome","viral etiologies","RESULT","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Morphological data have revealed that the tuberizing events result from the activation of the cambium, followed by cell proliferation. However, uncertainties still remain regarding the regulators participating in this signal-transduction pathway. An attempt was made to characterize the role of one MADS-box transcription factor, which was preferentially expressed in sweet potato roots at the early tuberization stage. METHODS: A differential expression level of IbMADS1 (Ipomoea batatas MADS-box 1) was detected temporally and spatially in sweet potato tissues. IbMADS1 responses to tuberization-related hormones were assessed. In order to identify the evolutionary significance, the expression pattern of IbMADS1 was surveyed in two tuber-deficient Ipomoea relatives, I. leucantha and I. trifida, and compared with sweet potato. In functional analyses, potato (Solanum tuberosum) was employed as a heterologous model. The resulting tuber morphogenesis was examined anatomically in order to address the physiological function of IbMADS1, which should act similarly in sweet potato. KEY RESULTS: IbMADS1 was preferentially expressed as tuberous root development proceeded. Its expression was inducible by tuberization-related hormones, such as jasmonic acid and cytokinins. In situ hybridization data showed that IbMADS1 transcripts were specifically distributed around immature meristematic cells within the stele and lateral root primordia. Inter-species examination indicated that IbMADS1 expression was relatively active in sweet potato roots, but undetectable in tuber-deficient Ipomoea species. IbMADS1-transformed potatoes exhibited tuber morphogenesis in the fibrous roots. The partial swellings along fibrous roots were mainly due to anomalous proliferation and differentiation in the xylem. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, it is proposed that IbMADS1 is an important integrator at the initiation of tuberization. As a result, the initiation and development of tuberous roots seems to be well regulated by a network involving a MADS-box gene in which such hormones as jasmonic acid and cytokinins may act as trigger factors.","publish_time":"2008-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ku, Amy Tsu; Huang, Yi-Shiuan; Wang, Yu-Shu; Ma, Daifu; Yeh, Kai-Wun","journal":"Annals of Botany","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9966ccef050ac0dc4d794363dbd1f865442ef0aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2712425.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-pdf/102/1/57/16994203/mcn067.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18463111/; https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcn067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IbMADS1 expression","sweet potato roots","IbMADS1 transcripts","IbMADS1 responses","tuberization mechanism of sweet potato","expression pattern of IbMADS1","sweet potato tissues","differential expression level of IbMADS1","physiological function of IbMADS1","fibrous roots","initiation of tuberization","tuberization-related hormones","Ipomoea batatas","tuber-deficient Ipomoea species","development of tuberous roots","tuber-deficient Ipomoea relatives","early tuberization stage","resulting tuber morphogenesis","jasmonic acid","cytokinins","box gene","tuberous root development","order","box transcription factor","anomalous proliferation","Morphological data","cell proliferation","Inter-species examination","lateral root primordia","situ hybridization data","stele","immature meristematic cells","Solanum tuberosum","evolutionary significance","functional analyses","leucantha","AIMS","trifida","important integrator","potatoes","tuberizing events","regulators","activation","cambium","differentiation","xylem","role","METHODS","BACKGROUND","partial swellings","signal-transduction pathway","trigger factors","network","study","KEY RESULTS","heterologous model","various approaches","CONCLUSIONS","uncertainties","attempt"],"language":"en"},

It causes a biphasic febrile illness that can be accompanied by central nervous system involvement and moderate morbidity in humans and severe mortality in equines. The virus has a history of weaponization, lacks FDA-approved therapeutics and vaccines in humans, and is considered a select agent. Like other RNA viruses, VEEV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and eventually induces apoptosis. The capsid protein, which contains a nuclear localization and a nuclear export sequence, induces a shutdown of host transcription and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Here we show that infection with VEEV causes a dysregulation of cell cycling and a delay in the G(0)/G(1) phase in Vero cells and U87MG astrocytes. Cells infected with VEEV encoding a capsid NLS mutant or treated with the capsid-importin \u03B1 interaction inhibitor G281-1485 were partially rescued from this cell cycle dysregulation. Pathway analysis of previously published RNA-sequencing data from VEEV infected U87MG astrocytes identified alterations of canonical pathways involving cell cycle, checkpoint regulation, and proliferation. Multiple cyclins including cyclin D1, cyclin A2 and cyclin E2 and other regulators of the cell cycle were downregulated in infected cells in a capsid NLS dependent manner. Loss of Rb phosphorylation, which is a substrate for cyclin/cdk complexes was also observed. These data demonstrate the importance of capsid nuclear localization and/or importin \u03B1 binding for inducing cell cycle arrest and transcriptional downregulation of key cell cycle regulators.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lundberg, Lindsay; Fontenot, Jacque; Lin, Shih-Chao; Pinkham, Chelsea; Carey, Brian D.; Campbell, Catherine E.; Kehn-Hall, Kylene","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75bee23cd59f44b79301f951a5627c47a1adcee3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631316/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell cycle dysregulation","dysregulation of cell","inducing cell cycle arrest","VEEV infected U87MG astrocytes","VEEV replicates","cytoplasm of infected cells","capsid protein","importance of capsid nuclear localization","transcriptional downregulation of key cell cycle regulators","capsid NLS mutant","cyclin D1","cyclin A2","cyclin E2","Vero cells","capsid NLS dependent manner","single-stranded RNA virus","capsid-importin \u03B1 interaction inhibitor G281","RNA viruses","humans","published RNA-sequencing data","importin \u03B1 binding","nuclear export sequence","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","moderate morbidity","alterations of canonical pathways","member","positive sense","central nervous system involvement","shutdown of host transcription","checkpoint regulation","FDA-approved therapeutics","severe mortality","substrate","phase","Multiple cyclins","nucleocytoplasmic trafficking","vaccines","history of weaponization","New World alphaviruses","Pathway analysis","equines","cdk complexes","proliferation","delay","Loss of Rb phosphorylation","biphasic febrile illness","infection","apoptosis","agent"],"language":"en"},

Most coronaviruses show a strong species specificity, although the SARS-Coronavirus crossed species from palm civet cats to infect humans.

Second, we showed that virus that was passed exclusively in suckling mouse brains was highly virulent and caused a uniformly fatal encephalitis in adult mice. The surface glycoprotein is a major virulence factor in most coronavirus infections. We identified three changes in the HCoV-OC43 surface glycoprotein that correlated with enhanced neurovirulence in mice; these were located in the domain of the protein responsible for binding to host cells.

A tandem alkylation, \u03B3-lactonization, a chemoselective reduction of ester in the presence of \u03B3-lactone functional group, a RCM reaction, and a Mitsunobu coupling reaction were used as key reactions. d-Counterpart nucleosides were also prepared according to the same synthetic method. Among the synthesized carbanucleosides, d-thymine nucleoside, d-2 and l-thymine nucleoside, l-2 exhibited excellent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities, in MT-4 cells, which were higher than those of ddI, an anti-AIDS drug. Whereas d-2 exhibited high cytotoxicity in MT-4 cell lines, l-2 did not show any discernible cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested, reflecting that l-2 may be a good candidate for an anti-AIDS drug. l-2 also showed weak anti-HSV-2 activity without cytotoxicity. However, none of the synthesized nucleosides exhibited antiviral activities against RNA viruses including coxsakie, influenza, corona and polio viruses, maybe due to their 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy structure. Potent antiviral effects of d-2 and l-2 indicate that nucleosides belonging to a class of D4Ns can be an excellent candidate for anti-DNA virus agents. This research strongly supports l-nucleosides of a class of D4Ns to be a very promising candidate for antiviral agents due to its low cytotoxicity and a good antiviral activity.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ah-Young; Kim, Won Hee; Kang, Jin-Ah; Lee, Hye Jin; Lee, Chong-Kyo; Moon, Hyung Ryong","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b99ed0fbbc06b1b6f0db98a1118f11d9cdba1008.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126181.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089611003798; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.05.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089611003798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21658957/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mitsunobu"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["d-Counterpart nucleosides","synthesized nucleosides","antiviral agents","high cytotoxicity","d-counterparts","excellent anti-HIV","anti-AIDS drug","d-thymine nucleoside","new anti-HIV agents","antiviral activities","low cytotoxicity","discernible cytotoxicity","Potent antiviral effects of d","anti-DNA virus agents","good antiviral activity","weak anti-HSV","excellent candidate","good candidate","promising candidate","cell lines","class of D4Ns","MT","synthesized carbanucleosides","presence of \u03B3","RNA viruses","\u03B3-lactonization","high potency","RCM reaction","polio viruses","synthetic method","novel synthetic strategy","coxsakie","lactone functional group","influenza","hexenyl carbanucleoside derivatives","chemoselective reduction of ester","corona","bicyclo","order","fixed north conformation","Mitsunobu","ddI","epichlorohydrin","tandem alkylation","cells","key reactions","fact","dideoxy structure","Abstract","research"],"language":"en"},

Up-to-date treatment regimens consist of prophylactic and supportive treatment of the recurrent infections. Here, we report the case of a 1-year-old boy of Moroccan consanguineous parents, who was diagnosed at 4 months of age with ICF syndrome with a homozygous missense mutation in the DNMT3B gene. He was initially admitted to the hospital with recurrent pulmonary infections from the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ). Further immunological workup revealed agammaglobulinemia in the presence of B cells. After successful recovery from the PJ pneumonia, he underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the HLA-matched healthy sister using a chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen consisting of treosulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa. Other than acute chemotherapy-associated side effects, no serious adverse events occurred. Six months after HSCT immune-reconstitution, he had a stable chimerism with 2.9% autologous portion in the peripheral blood and a normal differential blood cell count, including all immunoglobulin subtypes. This is one of the first cases of successful HSCT in ICF syndrome. Early diagnosis and subsequent HSCT can prevent severe opportunistic infections and cure the immunodeficiency. Centromeric instability and facial anomaly remain unaffected. Although the long-term patient outcome and the neurological development remain to be seen, this curative therapy for immunodeficiency improves life expectancy and quality of life. This case is meant to raise physicians awareness for ICF syndrome and highlight the consideration for HSCT in ICF syndrome early on.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F6ssling, Katharina L.; Schipp, Cyrill; Fischer, Ute; Babor, Florian; Koch, Gerhard; Schuster, Friedhelm R.; Dietzel-Dahmen, Jutta; Wieczorek, Dagmar; Borkhardt, Arndt; Meisel, Roland; Kuhlen, Michaela","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04dc7b970967766934f12292c0a007ebabe22652.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5491950.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28713390/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICF","HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICF syndrome","severe immunodeficiency","subsequent HSCT","recurrent infections","severe opportunistic infections","cases of successful HSCT","lethal infections","recurrent pulmonary infections","HSCT immune-reconstitution","facial anomaly","centromeric instability","Early diagnosis","early childhood","peripheral blood","PJ pneumonia","life expectancy","supportive treatment","quality of life","successful recovery","months of age","normal differential blood cell count","Up-to-date treatment regimens","opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis jirovecii","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","rare autosomal recessive genetic condition","chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen","homozygous missense mutation","effects","HLA-matched healthy sister","agammaglobulinemia","treosulfan","autologous portion","consideration","year-old boy of Moroccan consanguineous parents","long-term patient outcome","neurological development","fludarabine","stable chimerism","DNMT3B gene","curative therapy","physicians awareness","presence of B cells","acute chemotherapy-associated","serious adverse events","immunoglobulin subtypes","immunological workup","hospital","thiotepa"],"language":"en"},

Currently, vaccination against IBV is only partially protective; therefore, better preventions and treatments are needed. Plants produce antimicrobial secondary compounds, which may be a source for novel anti-viral drugs. Non-cytotoxic, crude ethanol extracts of Rhodiola rosea roots, Nigella sativa seeds, and Sambucus nigra fruit were tested for anti-IBV activity, since these safe, widely used plant tissues contain polyphenol derivatives that inhibit other viruses. RESULTS: Dose\u2013response cytotoxicity curves on Vero cells using trypan blue staining determined the highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of each plant extract. To screen for IBV inhibition, cells and virus were pretreated with extracts, followed by infection in the presence of extract. Viral cytopathic effect was assessed visually following an additional 24 h incubation with extract. Cells and supernatants were harvested separately and virus titers were quantified by plaque assay. Variations of this screening protocol determined the effects of a number of shortened S. nigra extract treatments. Finally, S. nigra extract-treated virions were visualized by transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. Virus titers from infected cells treated with R. rosea and N. sativa extracts were not substantially different from infected cells treated with solvent alone. However, treatment with S. nigra extracts reduced virus titers by four orders of magnitude at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in a dose-responsive manner. Infection at a low MOI reduced viral titers by six orders of magnitude and pretreatment of virus was necessary, but not sufficient, for full virus inhibition. Electron microscopy of virions treated with S. nigra extract showed compromised envelopes and the presence of membrane vesicles, which suggested a mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that S. nigra extract can inhibit IBV at an early point in infection, probably by rendering the virus non-infectious. They also suggest that future studies using S. nigra extract to treat or prevent IBV or other coronaviruses are warranted.","publish_time":"2014-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Christie; Zuckerman, David M; Brantley, Susanna; Sharpe, Michka; Childress, Kevin; Hoiczyk, Egbert; Pendleton, Amanda R","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8b1da52eeb1d7dc2ff2f2f20a44ef13160fd626.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3899428.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","MOI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus titers","nigra extract treatments","nigra extracts","nigra extract-treated virions","plant extract","presence of extract","virus inhibition","pretreatment of virus","virus non-infectious","IBV inhibition","viral titers","infected cells","Infectious bronchitis virus","sativa extracts","Sambucus nigra fruit","Vero cells","anti-IBV activity","multiplicity of infection","orders of magnitude","Electron microscopy of virions","RESULTS","novel anti-viral drugs","crude ethanol extracts of Rhodiola rosea roots","transmission electron microscopy","Viral cytopathic effect","highest non-cytotoxic concentrations","negative staining","plant tissues","low MOI","trypan blue staining","Nigella sativa seeds","presence of membrane vesicles","dose-responsive manner","response cytotoxicity curves","number of shortened","compromised envelopes","source","effects","polyphenol derivatives","BACKGROUND","screening protocol","antimicrobial secondary compounds","early point","pathogenic chicken coronavirus","Plants","better preventions","h incubation","solvent","plaque assay","future studies","supernatants","mechanism of action","Variations","vaccination","CONCLUSIONS","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

In addition to these internal deletions, various truncated RNAs were detected lacking either partially or completely the 3\u2032 terminal region which is supposed to code for viral replicase. RNA molecules with internal deletions as well as those with 3\u2032 terminal truncations could also be extracted directly from infected cells. During multiple consecutive passages of a given HAV strain, deletions A, B, and C accumulated and a quantitative increase of deleted RNAs occurred. Type and predominance of deletions varied with virus strains (CLF, GBM, MBB11/5, HM175, CR326, H141) and with the type of cells used for propagation (MRC-5, BGM, HELF, PLC/PRF/5). However, within the limits of the reliability of S1 analysis the endpoints of deletions A, B, and C were conserved. The mechanisms leading to formation of deletions remain unclear. Yet, some sequences flanking internal deletions showed homology with common splice signals and 3\u2032 terminal truncations proved to be confined to a distinct region within the genome.","publish_time":"1988-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00FCesch, J\u00FCrg; Krech, Sabine; Siegl, G\u00FCnter","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288905855; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682288905855","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["internal deletions","endpoints of deletions","predominance of deletions","formation of deletions","different deletions","prominent deletions","terminal region","terminal truncations","C accumulated","distinct region","type of cells","infected cells","various HAV isolates","various truncated RNAs","deleted genomes","quantitative increase of deleted RNAs","genome coding","viral replicase","given HAV strain","Abstract Defective viral particles","common splice signals","homology","virus strains","harvests of cell cultures","BGM","MBB11","GBM","CLF","multiple consecutive passages","reliability of S1 analysis","HELF","HM175","MRC","propagation","code","structural proteins","PLC","PRF","CR326","limits","H141","location","RNA molecules","sequences","addition","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Previous published serological studies showed that sera of Bactrian camels were all negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. However, a recent study revealed that direct inoculation of Bactrian camels intranasally with MERS-CoV can lead to infection with abundant virus shedding and seroconversion. In this study, we examined the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in Bactrian and hybrid camels in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (where dromedaries are also present), and Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China (where dromedaries are absent). For the 29 serum samples from Bactrian camels in Dubai tested by the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) and neutralization antibody test, 14 (48%) and 12 (41%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. All the 12 serum samples that were positive with the neutralization antibody test were also positive for the S-ELISA. For the 11 sera from hybrid camels in Dubai tested with the S-ELISA and neutralization antibody test, 6 (55%) and 9 (82%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. All the 6 serum samples that were positive for the S-ELISA were also positive with the neutralization antibody test. There was a strong correlation between the antibody levels detected by S-ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.6262 (P \u003C 0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.5062 to 0.7225). All 92 Bactrian camel serum samples from Xinjiang were negative for MERS-CoV antibodies tested using both S-ELISA and the neutralization antibody test. Bactrian and hybrid camels are potential sources of MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Since its first appearance in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has affected \u003E25 countries, with \u003E2,400 cases and an extremely high fatality rate of \u003E30%. The total number of mortalities due to MERS is already greater than that due to severe acute respiratory syndrome. MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been confirmed to be the etiological agent. So far, dromedaries are the only known animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. Previously published serological studies showed that sera of Bactrian camels were all negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. In this study, we observed that 41% of the Bactrian camel sera and 55% of the hybrid camel sera from Dubai (where dromedaries are also present), but none of the sera from Bactrian camels in Xinjiang (where dromedaries are absent), were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. Based on these results, we conclude that in addition to dromedaries, Bactrian and hybrid camels are also potential sources of MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K.

The difference between the patients with URTI and healthy subjects in their response to airway vibration may be explained on the basis of hyperreactivity of airway sensory receptors. We propose that the model of cough induced by airway vibration may be useful for studies on the pathophysiology and pharmacology of airway hyperreactivity in acute cough.

ACE2 is thought to play a critical role in regulating heart function, and in 2003, ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We have recently shown that like ACE, ACE2 undergoes ectodomain shedding and that this shedding event is up-regulated by phorbol esters. In the present study, we used gel shift assays to demonstrate that calmodulin, an intracellular calcium-binding protein implicated in the regulation of other ectodomain shedding events, binds a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 762\u2013777 within the cytoplasmic domain of human ACE2, forming a calcium-dependent calmodulin-peptide complex. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ACE2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells specifically binds to glutathione-S-transferase-calmodulin, but not glutathione-S-transferase alone, in pull-down assays using cell lysates. Finally, to investigate whether calmodulin has any effect on ACE2 ectodomain shedding in cells that endogenously express the enzyme, cells from a human liver cell line (Huh-7) expressing ACE2 were incubated with calmodulin-specific inhibitors, trifluoperazine and calmidazolium. Both trifluoperazine (25 \u03BCmol/liter) and calmidazolium, (25 \u03BCmol/liter) significantly increased the release of ACE2 into the medium (44.1 \u00B1 10.8%, P \u003C 0.05, Student\u2019s t test; unpaired, two-tailed, and 51.1 \u00B1 7.4% P \u003C 0.05, one-way ANOVA, respectively;), as analyzed by an ACE2-specific quenched fluorescence substrate assay. We also show that the calmodulin-specific inhibitor-stimulated shedding of ACE2 is independent from phorbol ester-induced shedding. In summary, we have demonstrated that calmodulin is able to bind ACE2 and suggest that the ACE2 ectodomain shedding and/or sheddase(s) activation regulated by calmodulin is independent from the phorbol ester-induced shedding.","publish_time":"2009-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Zon W.; Lew, Rebecca A.; Yarski, Michael A.; Mu, Fi-Tjen; Andrews, Robert K.; Smith, A.

Influenza A(H7N9) viruses isolated from humans show features suggesting partial adaptation to mammals. To provide insights into the pathogenesis of H7N9 virus infection, we compared risk factors, clinical presentation, and progression of patients hospitalized with H7N9, H5N1, and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus infections. Methods. We compared individual-level data from patients hospitalized with infection by H7N9 (n = 123), H5N1 (n = 119; 43 China, 76 Vietnam), and pH1N1 (n = 3486) viruses. We assessed risk factors for hospitalization after adjustment for age- and sex-specific prevalence of risk factors in the general Chinese population. Results. The median age of patients with H7N9 virus infection was older than other patient groups (63 years; P \u003C .001) and a higher proportion was male (71%; P \u003C .02). After adjustment for age and sex, chronic heart disease was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with H7N9 (relative risk, 9.68; 95% confidence interval, 5.24\u201317.9). H7N9 patients had similar patterns of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase to those seen in H5N1 patients, which were all significantly different from pH1N1 patients (P \u003C .005). H7N9 patients had a longer duration of hospitalization than either H5N1 or pH1N1 patients (P \u003C .001), and the median time from onset to death was 18 days for H7N9 (P = .002) vs 11 days for H5N1 and 15 days for pH1N1 (P = .154). Conclusions. The identification of known risk factors for severe seasonal influenza and the more protracted clinical course compared with that of H5N1 suggests that host factors are an important contributor to H7N9 severity.","publish_time":"2014-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chen; Yu, Hongjie; Horby, Peter W.; Cao, Bin; Wu, Peng; Yang, Shigui; Gao, Hainv; Li, Hui; Tsang, Tim K.; Liao, Qiaohong; Gao, Zhancheng; Ip, Dennis K.

Thiazolidinediones have been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity, improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients and to improve the histologic markers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. This study aims to determine the safety and effectiveness of rosiglitazone in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients with NAFLD. Methods Taiwanese type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate control on insulin secretagogues and metformin, with no history of significant alcohol ingestion, with mildly elevated serum aspartate amino-transferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and a diagnosis of fatty liver determined by ultrasonography were enrolled. Patients were treated for 24 weeks with rosiglitazone, 4-8 mg daily. Primary endpoints were change in AST and ALT levels from baseline and reduction in A1C \u003C 6.5%. Results Out of a total of 68 patients, 60 (88.2%) completed the study treatment without serious adverse events.

These intrinsically disordered proteins/regions constitute a significant part of all proteomes, and their functional repertoire is complementary to functions of ordered proteins. In fact, intrinsic disorder represents an important driving force for many specific functions. An illustrative example of such disorder-centric functional class is RNA-binding proteins. In this study, we present the results of comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of the abundance and roles of intrinsic disorder in 3,411 ribosomal proteins from 32 species. We show that many ribosomal proteins are intrinsically disordered or hybrid proteins that contain ordered and disordered domains. Predicted globular domains of many ribosomal proteins contain noticeable regions of intrinsic disorder. We also show that disorder in ribosomal proteins has different characteristics compared to other proteins that interact with RNA and DNA including overall abundance, evolutionary conservation, and involvement in protein\u2013protein interactions. Furthermore, intrinsic disorder is not only abundant in the ribosomal proteins, but we demonstrate that it is absolutely necessary for their various functions.

The two types of AR STAT1 defect give rise to a broad infectious phenotype with susceptibility to intramacrophagic bacteria (mostly mycobacteria) and viruses (herpes viruses at least), due principally to the impairment of IFN-\u03B3-mediated and IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2-mediated immunity, respectively. Clinical outcome depends on the extent to which the STAT1 defect decreases responsiveness to these cytokines. AD STAT1 deficiency selectively predisposes individuals to mycobacterial disease, owing to the impairment of IFN-\u03B3-mediated immunity, as IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2-mediated immunity is maintained. Finally, AD gain of STAT1 activity is associated with autoimmunity, probably owing to an enhancement of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2-mediated immunity. More surprisingly, it is also associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, through as yet undetermined mechanisms involving an inhibition of the development of IL-17-producing T cells. Thus, germline mutations in human STAT1 define four distinct clinical disorders. Various combinations of viral, mycobacterial and fungal infections are therefore allelic at the human STAT1 locus. These experiments of Nature neatly highlight the clinical and immunological impact of the human genetic dissection of infectious phenotypes.","publish_time":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boisson-Dupuis, Stephanie; Kong, Xiao-Fei; Okada, Satoshi; Cypowyj, Sophie; Puel, Anne; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent","journal":"Current Opinion in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1d79e3e5aea43063467b6b4939b8fc3d9240dd0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fb9a0c92bd391da22436132a0bd69ae88f18b21c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3477860.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791512000738; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791512000738; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2012.04.011; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3477860?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22651901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AD STAT1 deficiency","human STAT1 locus","complete STAT1 deficiency","AR partial STAT1 deficiency","AD gain of STAT1 activity","types of AR STAT1 defect","\u03B2-mediated immunity","definition of inborn errors of human STAT1 immunity","IFN-\u03B1","\u03B3-mediated immunity","impairment of IFN","enhancement of IFN","human genetic dissection of infectious phenotypes","genetic dissection of various human infectious diseases","Clinical outcome","broad infectious phenotype","distinct clinical disorders","autosomal recessive","autosomal dominant","mycobacterial disease","herpes viruses","Various combinations of viral","rise","susceptibility","intramacrophagic bacteria","immunological impact","fungal infections","individuals","inhibition","undetermined mechanisms","extent","development of IL","germline mutations","chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis","responsiveness","cytokines","autoimmunity","experiments of Nature","T cells"],"language":"en"},

A resulting change in pediatric fracture epidemiology is expected. This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fracture incidence and characteristics. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study comparing acute fractures presenting to a single level I pediatric trauma hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic with fractures during a prepandemic period at the same institution. The \u0022pandemic\u0022 cohort was gathered from March 15 to April 15, 2020 and compared with a \u0022prepandemic\u0022 cohort from the same time window in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS In total, 1745 patients presenting with acute fractures were included. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of fractures presenting to our practice during the pandemic (22.5\u00B19.1/d vs. 9.6\u00B15.1/d, P\u003C0.001). The presenting age for all fractures decreased during the pandemic (7.5\u00B14.3 vs. 9.4\u00B14.4 y, P\u003C0.001) because of decreased fracture burden among adolescents. There were also a decrease in the number of fractures requiring surgery (2.2\u00B11.8/d vs. 0.8\u00B10.8/d, P\u003C0.001). During the pandemic, there was an increase in the proportion of injuries occurring at home (57.8% vs. 32.5%, P\u003C0.001) or on bicycles (18.3% vs. 8.2%, P\u003C0.001), but a decrease in those related to sports (7.2% vs. 26.0%, P\u003C0.001) or playgrounds (5.2% vs. 9.0%, P\u003C0.001). There was no increase in time-to-presentation. Patients with distal radius torus fractures were more likely to receive a velcro splint during the pandemic (44.2% vs. 25.9%, P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS Pediatric fracture volume has decreased 2.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially because of cessation of organized sports and decreased playground use. In endemic regions, lower trauma volume may allow redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and staff to other clinical arenas.

The CBC and the transcript abundance of cytokines and their receptors expressed in leukocytes were measured from calves at two early timepoints, and again after diagnosis with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). RESULTS: Blood was collected from calves at pre-conditioning (n = 796) and weaning (n = 791) for CBC. Blood counts were also measured for the calves with BRD (n = 13), and asymptomatic calves (n = 75) after weaning. The CBC were compared for these animals at 3 time points. At diagnosis, neutrophils were higher and basophils lower in sick animals (P \u003C 0.05). To further characterize BRD responses, transcript abundance of 84 cytokine genes were evaluated in 5 calves with BRD and 9 asymptomatic animals at all time points. There was more data for CBC than transcript abundance; hence, animal and temporary environmental correlations between CBC and transcript abundance were exploited to improve the power of the transcript abundance data. Expression of CCL16, CXCR1, CCR1 was increased in BRD positive animals compared to controls (P-corrected \u003C 0.1).

Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. Aim of the study We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. Materials and methods Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18\u03B2-glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03B2-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-\u03B2 were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p\u003C0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18\u03B2-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p\u003C0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p\u003C0.0001) and penetration (p\u003C0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300\u03BCg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-\u03B2 to counteract viral infection. Conclusions Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18\u03B2-GA may be one of its active constituents.","publish_time":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng Yeh, Chia; Chih Wang, Kuo; Chai Chiang, Lien; Shieh, Den En; Hong Yen, Ming; San Chang, Jung","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/441c8e1d5d68c384640aa16f9661492a0618cc14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126896.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037887411300305X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23643542/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037887411300305X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.04.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Radix Glycyrrhizae","Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV","Results Radix Glycyrrhizae","effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae","anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae","Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose","HRSV infection","anti-HRSV effects","preparations of licorice","active constituents of licorice","preparation of licorice","viral infection","\u03B2-GA","IFN-\u03B2","A549 cells","potent anti-HRSV activity","mucosal cells","inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation","viral replication","viral amounts","viral inoculation","host cells","Abilities of crude licorice","A549 cell lines","inhibition of viral attachment","respiratory mucosal cell lines","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Licorice","\u03B2-glycyrrhetinic acid","methods Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations","airway epithelial cells","respiratory tract cell lines","plaque reduction assay","infection of human respiratory syncytial virus","qRT-PCR","glycyrrhizin","IFN secretion","human upper","herbal medicine","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine","Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","common ingredient","Leguminosae","food supplement","ELISA","internalization","Materials","Conclusions","centuries","difference","hypothesis","study","penetration","\u03BCg","suspension"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to determine whether polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for respiratory viruses increase the diagnostic yield of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in immunocompromised children. METHODS: BAL samples obtained from immunocompromised children hospitalized with pneumonia were processed for respiratory viruses by viral culture, rapid antigen test and PCR (for CMV, adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, herpesvirus, RSV and hMPV). RESULTS: The study group included 42 patients (mean age 7.2 \u00B1 5.1 years) with 50 episodes of clinical pneumonia (50 BAL samples). Forty viral pathogens were identified in 30 episodes (60%). PCR increased the diagnostic rate by fourfold (75% identified by PCR alone, p \u003C 0.0001). When viral culture and rapid antigen test were used as the gold standard, PCR was found to have high sensitivity (86\u2013100% when assessed) and specificity (80\u201396%). The PCR results prompted the initiation of specific antiviral therapy and the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic treatment in 17 (34%) episodes.

In this study, evidence is provided that immunity induced by natural exposure to enteric CCoV is not fully protective against strain CB/05. Twenty-two, 10-week-old beagles with a recent natural infection by enteric CCoV were randomly distributed in two experimental groups of eight (groups A and B) and one control group of six (group C) dogs. Dogs in groups A and B were inoculated oronasally with different doses (4\u00D7105 or 4\u00D7103 TCID50) of the pantropic strain CB/05, whereas dogs in group C were used as negative controls. Clinical, post-mortem and virological investigations showed that, despite the high serum antibody titres induced by the prior natural infection with enteric CCoV, dogs were susceptible to experimental infection with strain CB/05. This was shown by the occurrence of faecal shedding, and dogs displaying moderate clinical signs, mainly vomiting and diarrhoea. Involvement of the lymphoid tissues was evident as demonstrated by the acute lymphopenia (below 70% of the initial counts), gross lesions in spleen and lymph nodes and detection of CB/05 RNA in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes of some infected dogs. The presence of viral RNA in lymphoid tissues was observed only in dogs euthanised in the early stages of infection and the clinical course of the infection was unrelated to the viral dose administered.

FeMV has been associated with chronic kidney disease of cats characterized by tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), although this aspect is still controversial and not demonstrated with certainty. To investigate FeMV prevalence and genomic characteristics, an epidemiological survey was conducted in a total number of 127 household cats originating from two Italian regions, Abruzzi and Emilia-Romagna. A total number of 69 cats originating from three feline colonies were also enrolled for the study. Correlation with TIN was investigated by employing a total number of 35 carcasses. Prevalence of FeMV RNA was higher in urine samples collected from cats of colonies (P = 31.8%, CI 95% 22.1\u201343.6) compared to household cats (P = 8.66%, CI 95% 4.9\u201314.9) and in young and middle-aged cats while prevalence of FeMV Abs was higher in old cats. Sequences obtained straight from infected biological samples, either partial or complete, cluster into two clades within FeMV genotype 1, distantly related to FeMV genotype 2. Immunohistochemistry analysis of kidney sections of FeMV RNA positive cats revealed immunoreactivity within epithelial cells of renal tubuli and inflammatory cells. However, statistically significant association between FeMV and renal damages, including TIN, was not demonstrated (p= 0.0695, Fisher exact test). By virus histochemistry performed with FeMV-negative feline tissues and a FeMV isolate, tropism for different cellular types such as inflammatory cells residing in blood vessels of kidney and brain, airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and to a lesser extent, the central nervous system, was demonstrated. Additional studies are warranted in order to establish viral tropism and immune response during the early phases of infection and to disentangle the role of FeMV in co-infection processes.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Luca, Eliana; Crisi, Paolo Emidio; Marcacci, Maurilia; Malatesta, Daniela; Di Sabatino, Daria; Cito, Francesca; D\u2019Alterio, Nicola; Puglia, Ilaria; Berjaoui, Shadia; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Tinelli, Antonella; Rip\u00E0, Paola; Vincifori, Giacomo; Di Teodoro, Giovanni; Dondi, Francesco; Savini, Giovanni; Boari, Andrea; Lorusso, Alessio","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddbe321178b25ba2cc1f1f9b3a3e87a8724f2380.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127367.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519311198; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519311198; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31902482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Abruzzi","Fisher"],"organizations":["TIN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FeMV prevalence","FeMV genotype","FeMV isolate","role of FeMV","Prevalence of FeMV RNA","cats of colonies","household cats","prevalence of FeMV Abs","middle-aged cats","FeMV-negative feline tissues","Immunohistochemistry analysis of kidney sections of FeMV RNA positive cats","chronic kidney disease of cats","inflammatory cells","TIN","total number","feline colonies","airway epithelial cells","epithelial cells of renal tubuli","Abstract Feline morbillivirus","blood vessels of kidney","urine samples","renal damages","viral tropism","emerging morbillivirus","infected biological samples","early phases of infection","co-infection processes","immunoreactivity","brain","different cellular types","alveolar macrophages","lesser extent","immune response","order","epidemiological survey","Italian regions","cluster","genomic characteristics","tubulointerstitial nephritis","central nervous system","clades","significant association","virus histochemistry","Abruzzi","Emilia-Romagna","Sequences","Fisher exact test","Additional studies","aspect","carcasses","certainty","study","Correlation","decade"],"language":"en"},

It is suspected that, driven by buoyancy force, the polluted air that exits the window of the lower floor may re-enter the immediate upper floor through the window on the same side. This cascade effect has been quantified and reported in a previous paper, and it is found that, by tracer gas concentration analysis, the room in the adjacent upstairs may contain up to 7% of the air directly from the downstairs room. In this study, after validation against the experimental data from literatures, Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are both adopted to numerically investigate the dispersion of expiratory aerosols between two vertically adjacent flats. It is found that the particle concentration in the upper floor is two to three orders of magnitude lower than in the source floor. 1.0\u03BCm particles disperse like gaseous pollutants. For coarse particles larger than 20.0\u03BCm, strong deposition on solid surfaces and gravitational settling effect greatly limit their upward transport.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, N.

Here, we report our findings of a head-to-head comparison of two viral vectors modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and a novel replication-competent modified vaccinia Tian Tan (MVTT) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) via intramuscular and mucosal vaccinations in mice. MVTT is an attenuated variant of the wild-type VTT, which was historically used as a smallpox vaccine for millions of Chinese people. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV was used as the test antigen after the S gene was constructed in the identical genomic location of two vectors to generate vaccine candidates MVTT-S and MVA-S. Using identical doses, MVTT-S induced lower levels (\u223C2-3-fold) of anti- SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) than MVA-S through intramuscular inoculation. MVTT-S, however, was capable of inducing consistently 20-to-100-fold higher levels of Nabs than MVA-S when inoculated via either intranasal or intraoral routes. These levels of MVTT-S-induced Nab responses were substantially (\u223C10-fold) higher than that induced via the intramuscular route in the same experiments. Moreover, pre-exposure to the wild-type VTT via intranasal or intraoral route impaired the Nab response via the same routes of MVTT-S vaccination probably due to the pre-existing anti-VTT Nab response. The efficacy of intranasal or intraoral vaccination, however, was still 20-to-50-fold better than intramuscular inoculation despite the subcutaneous pre-exposure to wild-type VTT. Our data have implications for people who maintain low levels of anti-VTT Nabs after historical smallpox vaccination. MVTT is therefore an attractive live viral vector for mucosal vaccination.","publish_time":"2009-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Xiaoxing; Lu, Bin; Yu, Wenbo; Fang, Qing; Liu, Li; Zhuang, Ke; Shen, Tingting; Wang, Haibo; Tian, Po; Zhang, Linqi; Chen, Zhiwei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4fc28f1a66e4664a3dc12f5b121ee97aa9f122d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2613559.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19159014/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004180","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tian Tan"],"organizations":["MVTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S vaccination","MVA-S","levels of MVTT","vaccine candidates MVTT-S","S gene","routes of MVTT","MVTT-S induced lower levels","intraoral vaccination","fold","wild-type VTT","low levels of anti-VTT","pre-existing anti-VTT","intramuscular inoculation","intramuscular route","higher levels","historical smallpox vaccination","viral vectors","intraoral routes","anti- SARS-CoV","viral transmission","smallpox vaccine","mucosal vaccinations","efficacy of intranasal","neutralizing antibodies","protective immune response","subcutaneous pre-exposure","vaccinia Ankara","attractive live viral vector","identical doses","identical genomic location","millions of Chinese people","novel replication-competent modified vaccinia Tian Tan","great advantage","head-to-head comparison","attenuated variant","implications","test antigen","dissemination","mice","spike glycoprotein","findings","data","experiments","responses"],"language":"en"},

Critical care technologies used to support patients with ARDS, including strategies for mechanical ventilation, have resulted in improved outcomes in the last decade. However, there is still a need for effective pharmacotherapies to treat ARDS, as mortality rates remain high. To date, no single pharmacotherapy has proven effective in decreasing mortality in adult patients with ARDS, although exogenous surfactant replacement has been shown to reduce mortality in the paediatric population with ARDS from direct causes. Several promising therapies are currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical trials for treatment of ARDS in its acute and subacute, exudative phases. These include exogenous surfactant therapy, \u03B2(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists, antioxidants, immunomodulating agents and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Recent research has also focused on prevention of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress in patients at risk. Drugs such as captopril, rosiglitazone and incyclinide (COL-3), a tetracycline derivative, have shown promising results in animal models, but have not yet been tested clinically. Further research is needed to discover therapies to treat ARDS in its late, fibroproliferative phase. Given the vast number of negative clinical trials to date, it is unlikely that a single pharmacotherapy will effectively treat all patients with ARDS from differing causes. Future randomized controlled trials should target specific, more homogeneous subgroups of patients for single or combination therapy.","publish_time":"2012-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bosma, Karen J.; Taneja, Ravi; Lewis, James F.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5ee4cee15219250e6c336700c2e66059cc46525.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20568833/; https://doi.org/10.2165/10898570-000000000-00000","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of ARDS","adult patients","acute respiratory distress syndrome","single pharmacotherapy","homogeneous subgroups of patients","prevention of acute lung injury","decreasing mortality","promising results","mortality rates","direct causes","date","exogenous surfactant therapy","promising therapies","exogenous surfactant replacement","vast number of negative clinical trials","life-threatening form of respiratory failure","indirect injury","Future randomized controlled trials","paediatric population","effective pharmacotherapies","combination therapy","differing causes","Recent research","ill patient population","immunomodulating agents","HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors","antioxidants","lungs","adrenergic receptor agonists","mechanical ventilation","captopril","rosiglitazone","COL","statins","strategies","risk","improved outcomes","tetracycline derivative","Critical care technologies","incyclinide","exudative phases","animal models","fibroproliferative phase","need","decade","Drugs"],"language":"en"},

Prions are infectious agents that do not possess a genome and the pathogenic protein was not thought to evoke any immune response. Although we previously reported that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, suggesting the protective role of host innate immune responses mediated by IRF3 signalling, this remained to be clarified. Here, we investigated the reciprocal interactions of type I interferon evoked by IRF3 activation and prion infection and found that infecting prions cause the suppression of endogenous interferon expression. Conversely, treatment with recombinant interferons in an ex vivo model was able to inhibit prion infection. In addition, cells and mice deficient in type I interferon receptor (subunit interferon alpha/beta receptor 1), exhibited higher susceptibility to 22L-prion infection. Moreover, in in vivo and ex vivo prion-infected models, treatment with RO8191, a selective type I interferon receptor agonist, inhibited prion invasion and prolonged the survival period of infected mice. Taken together, these data indicated that the interferon signalling interferes with prion propagation and some interferon-stimulated genes might play protective roles in the brain. These findings may allow for the development of new strategies to combat fatal diseases.","publish_time":"2019-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ishibashi, Daisuke; Homma, Takujiro; Nakagaki, Takehiro; Fuse, Takayuki; Sano, Kazunori; Satoh, Katsuya; Mori, Tsuyoshi; Atarashi, Ryuichiro; Nishida, Noriyuki","journal":"Brain","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c95aea18951cb2b0ba90fe898b92b09ac419c5b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6439327.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prion infection","interferon signalling","prion propagation","abnormal prion protein","interferon receptor agonist","prion-infected models","pathogenesis of prion diseases","inhibited prion invasion","subunit interferon alpha","interferon-stimulated genes","interferon regulatory factor","structural conversion of normal prion protein","suppression of endogenous interferon expression","IRF3 signalling","Infectious prions","beta receptor","selective type","treatment","IRF3 activation","infecting prions","pathogenic protein","reciprocal interactions of type","protective roles","mice deficient","survival period of infected mice","immune responses","fatal diseases","infectious agents","protective role of host","transmissible spongiform encephalopathies","RO8191","Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease","humans","development of new strategies","recombinant interferons","cells","higher susceptibility","addition","genome","brain","data","findings"],"language":"en"},

In infected cells they induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which are thought to be the site of virus replication. Until recently, both the origin of the CoV-induced vesicles and the exact localization of CoV replication remained unknown. It was assumed that the vesicles derive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Nevertheless no conventional protein markers of the ER, ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi, or coatomer proteins could be detected in these structures. Recent data from our laboratory and others shed light on this mystery. It appears that the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a prototype CoV, co-opts ERAD tuning vesicles as replication platforms. These vesicles are released from the ER, but do not contain conventional ER markers or coatomer proteins. Rather, they contain ERAD factors such as SEL1L, EDEM1, and OS-9 that are constitutively cleared from the folding compartment by so called ERAD tuning programs, and display non-lipidated LC3 (LC3-I) periferically associated at their limiting membrane. In MHV-infected cells, the ERAD tuning vesicle markers co-localize with viral non-structural proteins and double-stranded RNA, which are DMV markers. The unconventional role of LC3-I in the MHV infection cycle is further supported by the fact that Atg5 and Atg7, both essential proteins for LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and macroautophagy, are dispensable for CoV replication and DMV formation. These new insights into CoV replication might lead to new therapies to treat CoV infections. They also reveal a novel role for LC3, in its non-lipidated form, in both maintenance of cellular proteostasis and viral infection, the latter function supported by recent findings showing involvement of LC3-I in equine arteritis virus replication.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noack, Julia; Bernasconi, Riccardo; Molinari, Maurizio","journal":"Autophagy: Cancer, Other Pathologies, Inflammation, Immunity, Infection, and Aging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb4dba076a39396397586c4f5bb18dd28993314e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150285.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124058774000081; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124058774000081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ERAD","DMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ERAD tuning vesicles","CoV-induced vesicles","involvement of LC3","non-lipidated LC3","conventional ER markers","prototype CoV","exact localization of CoV replication","CoV infections","replication platforms","unconventional role of LC3","site of virus replication","DMV markers","coatomer proteins","double-membrane vesicles","equine arteritis virus replication","ERAD tuning programs","ERAD tuning vesicle markers co-","ERAD factors","essential proteins","viral non-structural proteins","conventional protein markers","MHV-infected cells","viral infection","MHV infection cycle","non-lipidated form","Golgi intermediate compartment","Mouse Hepatitis Virus","new therapies","folding compartment","DMV formation","new insights","recent findings","Recent data","limiting membrane","novel role","double-stranded RNA","enveloped viruses responsible","severe respiratory diseases","DMVs","maintenance of cellular proteostasis","CoVs","birds","function","ERGIC","Atg7","macroautophagy","convoluted membranes","mammals","SEL1L","EDEM1","Atg5","Abstract Coronaviruses","CMs","laboratory","conversion","endoplasmic reticulum","origin","light","mystery","structures"],"language":"en"},

While the majority of those exposed have minor symptoms and recover with little morbidity, an estimated 500,000 people succumb to IAV-related complications each year worldwide. In these severe cases, an exaggerated inflammatory response, known as \u201Ccytokine storm\u201D, occurs which results in damage to the respiratory epithelial barrier and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data from retrospective human studies as well as experimental animal models of influenza virus infection highlight the fine line between an excessive and an inadequate immune response, where the host response must balance viral clearance with exuberant inflammation. Current pharmacological modulators of inflammation, including corticosteroids and statins, have not been successful in improving outcomes during influenza virus infection. We have reported that the amplitude of the inflammatory response is regulated by Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex (LUBAC) activity and that dampening of LUBAC activity is protective during severe influenza virus infection. Therapeutic modulation of LUBAC activity may be crucial to improve outcomes during severe influenza virus infection, as it functions as a molecular rheostat of the host response. Here we review the evidence for modulating inflammation to ameliorate influenza virus infection-induced lung injury, data on current anti-inflammatory strategies, and potential new avenues to target viral inflammation and improve outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brazee, Patricia L.; Sznajder, Jacob I.","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0b85e7f8627c38dda91271859949d131bbc0ae1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405132/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289620301381; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289620301381?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.04.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe influenza virus infection","Abstract Influenza virus infection","influenza virus infection-induced lung injury","experimental animal models of influenza virus infection","host response","viral inflammation","outcomes","exaggerated inflammatory response","severe cases","modulating inflammation","exuberant inflammation","inadequate immune response","severe pulmonary edema","respiratory failure","Data","Therapeutic modulation of LUBAC activity","Current pharmacological modulators of inflammation","respiratory epithelial barrier","viral clearance","minor symptoms","development of acute respiratory distress syndrome","current anti-inflammatory strategies","body aches","potential new avenues","people","Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex","mild congestion","fine line","little morbidity","retrospective human studies","IAV-related complications","ARDS","corticosteroids","year","damage","statins","molecular rheostat","evidence","cytokine storm","majority","amplitude"],"language":"en"},

A few small-scale human quercetin supplementation studies have produced conflicting results regarding quercetin\u0027s effects on upper respiratory tract infection rates, and little is known regarding the appropriate human dose. The purpose of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to measure the influence of two quercetin doses (500 and 1000mg/day) compared to placebo on upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) rates in a large community group (N =1002) of subjects varying widely in age (18\u201385 years). Subjects ingested supplements for 12 weeks and logged URTI symptoms on a daily basis using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS). No significant group differences were measured for URTI outcomes for all subjects combined, or when analyzing separately by gender, body mass index, and age categories. Regression analysis revealed that the strongest interaction effect with group status was self-reported fitness level. A separate analysis of subjects 40 years of age and older rating themselves in the top half of the entire group for fitness level (N =325) showed lower URTI severity (36% reduction, P =0.020) and URTI total sick days (31% reduction, P =0.048) for the Q-1000 group compared to placebo. In summary, for all subjects combined, quercetin supplementation over 12 weeks had no significant influence on URTI rates or symptomatology compared to placebo. A reduction in URTI total sick days and severity was noted in middle aged and older subjects ingesting 1000mgquercetin/day for 12 weeks who rated themselves as physically fit.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heinz, Serena A.; Henson, Dru A.; Austin, Melanie D.; Jin, Fuxia; Nieman, David C.","journal":"Pharmacological Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5027cd31c6cfc9b2ffee9e5e38cacbff26566ac9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128946.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661810001064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20478383/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661810001064; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2010.05.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["URTI rates","URTI outcomes","older subjects","lower URTI severity","URTI total sick days","logged URTI symptoms","group status","entire group","weeks","reduction","separate analysis of subjects","significant group differences","upper respiratory tract infection rates","Abstract Quercetin","years of age","quercetin doses","large community group","human quercetin supplementation studies","significant influence","placebo-controlled trial","age categories","Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey","self-reported fitness level","older rating","Regression analysis","appropriate human dose","conflicting results","quercetin\u0027s effects","target cells","daily basis","anti-pathogenic activities","strongest interaction effect","pathogens","wide variety of viruses","body mass index","double-blinded","culture","WURSS","half","mgquercetin","symptomatology","supplements","bacteria","gender","purpose","summary"],"language":"en"},

The residues of the \u03B2-hairpin motif (residues 138\u2013158), an extension of two \u03B2-strands of the C-terminal \u03B2-barrel of HAV 3C are critical for the interactions between the enzyme and the tetrapeptide portion of these inhibitors that are analogous to the residues at the P4 to P1 positions in the natural substrates of picornaviral 3C proteinases.

Methods From August through December 2009, 964 symptomatic adult outpatients were included. RT-PCR was used to detect the following pathogens: influenza A (H1N1) and B, parainfluenza 1\u20134, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus (OC43, 229E, NL63), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella species. The Dutch GHOR, American CDC and WHO, and British HPA case definitions were evaluated. Results A respiratory pathogen was detected in 41% of tested patient samples; influenza A (H1N1) and human rhinovirus were both detected in 16%. Clinical presentation of influenza cases was significantly more serious when compared to rhinovirus or negative-tested cases. Test characteristics were almost similar for all 4 case definitions, with an average sensitivity of 66%, specificity of 70%, positive predictive value of 34% and negative predictive value of 90%. Conclusions Influenza A (H1N1) and human rhinovirus were the major pathogens responsible for respiratory disease. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Amsterdam followed a mild course.

Virus discovery and rapid implementation of diagnostic tests for newly discovered viruses has strongly beneficiated from the development of molecular techniques. Viral load and antiviral resistance or subtyping assays are now part of the biological monitoring of patients chronically infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and CMV. It will be important to add to this panel assays for other viruses of the herpesviridae family. Qualitative assays for the detection of blood-borne viruses have increased safety of blood donation and organ transplantation. Screening of other blood-borne viruses (parvovirus B19, HAV), multiplexing of detection and test automation to improve practicability and reduce costs will be the next steps. A major evolution in the near future will be the generalization of NAT for the diagnosis of viral etiology in patients, mostly with respiratory, CNS or gastro-intestinal diseases. Major technical improvements have been made to avoid obstacles that still limit this generalization, i.e. genetic variability of viruses, multiplex detection, contamination risk. Commercial offers already exist but menus must be extended to limit the validation and documentation work associated with home-brew assays. Real-time amplification has allowed the development of new NAT platforms but automation and integration of all steps of the reaction are still required to reduce hands-on-time, time-to-result and costs, and to increase throughput.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vernet, Guy","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8158d9f560a4065ad16ec917c3b56164e9ebabcc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108418.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653204001696; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653204001696","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAT","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discovered viruses","detection of blood","Virus discovery","subtyping assays","home-brew assays","panel assays","Qualitative assays","hepatitis C virus","hepatitis B virus","genetic variability of viruses","human immunodeficiency virus","multiplex detection","generalization of NAT","costs","steps","diagnosis of viral etiology","development of molecular techniques","improved diagnosis","increased safety of blood donation","development of new NAT platforms","Viral load","test automation","major evolution","biological monitoring of patients","Abstract Molecular biology","Major technical improvements","rapid implementation of diagnostic tests","integration","HIV","HBV","CNS","antiviral resistance","organ transplantation","near future","documentation work","HCV","practicability","HAV","parvovirus B19","contamination risk","gastro-intestinal diseases","field of clinical virology","validation","reaction","CMV","hands","result","Real-time amplification","herpesviridae family","Commercial offers","menus","obstacles","Screening","throughput"],"language":"en"},

This may be circumvented by having the participants collect their own nasal swabs. We compared self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of swabbing quality and detection of viral respiratory pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective study among employees of our institution during the ARI season 2010/2011 (December-March). Weekly emails were sent to the participants (n = 84), reminding them to come to the study center in case of new symptoms. The participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one nostril, and trained study personnel collected one from the other nostril. The participants self-collected another two swabs (one from each nostril) on a subsequent day. Human \u03B2-actin DNA concentration was determined in the swabs as a quality control. Viral respiratory pathogens were detected by multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV15 kit, Seegene, Eschborn, Germany). Of 84 participants, 56 (67%) reported at least one ARI episode, 18 participants two, and one participant three. Self-swabbing was highly accepted by the participants. The amount of \u03B2-actin DNA per swab was higher in the self- than in the staff-collected swabs (p = 0.008). \u03B2-actin concentration was lower in the self-swabs collected on day 1 than in those collected on a subsequent day (p\u003C0.0001). A respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs (p = 0.36). With both approaches, the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A/B/C (12/75 swabs, 16%) and human coronavirus OC43 (4/75 swabs, 5%). There was almost perfect agreement between self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of pathogen detection (agreement = 93%, kappa = 0.85, p\u003C0.0001).

In a nested case\u2013control analysis, AR was associated with RVs (hazard ratio [HR] 6.54), Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with LRTID (HR 8.54), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication or disease was associated with URTID (HR 2.53) in the previous 3 mo. There was no association between RVs and Aspergillus spp. colonization or infection (HR 0.71). In conclusion, we documented a high incidence of RV infections in LTRs.

Spike (S) proteins are present on the surface of MERS-CoV virions and mediate viral entry. S is the primary target for MERS-CoV vaccine and antibody development, and it has become increasingly important to understand MERS-CoV antibody binding specificity and function. Commonly used serological methods like ELISA, biolayer interferometry, and flow cytometry are informative, but limited. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput protein binding inhibition assay using image cytometry. The image cytometry-based high-throughput screening method was developed by selecting a cell type with high DPP4 expression and defining optimal seeding density and protein binding conditions. The ability of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit MERS-CoV S binding was then tested. Binding inhibition results were comparable with those described in previous literature for MERS-CoV spike monomer and showed similar patterns as neutralization results. The coefficient of variation (CV) of our cell-based assay was \u003C10%. The proposed image cytometry method provides an efficient approach for characterizing potential therapeutic antibodies for combating MERS-CoV that compares favorably with current methods. The ability to rapidly determine direct antibody binding to host cells in a high-throughput manner can be applied to study other pathogen-antibody interactions and thus can impact future research on viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosen, Osnat; Chan, Leo Li-Ying; Abiona, Olubukola M.; Gough, Portia; Wang, Lingshu; Shi, Wei; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Nianshuang; Kong, Wing-Pui; McLellan, Jason S.; Graham, Barney S.; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f894f55b27a073407a13bad1c2f247df1a2d9cc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6357230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468747/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418303185; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.11.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418303185","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV S binding","MERS-CoV vaccine","MERS-CoV antibody binding specificity","MERS-CoV spike monomer","CoV virions","surface of MERS","direct antibody binding","Binding inhibition results","high-throughput protein binding inhibition assay","protein binding conditions","high-throughput manner","high-throughput screening method","flow cytometry","antibody development","proposed image cytometry method","potential therapeutic antibodies","high DPP4 expression","pathogen-antibody interactions","neutralizing antibodies","ability of monoclonal antibodies","viral pathogens","cell-based assay","serological methods","current methods","cell type","neutralization results","viral entry","emergence of new pathogens","optimal seeding density","efficient approach","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","biolayer interferometry","host cells","similar patterns","global public health","serious challenges","previous literature","ELISA","study","prevention options","primary target","urgent need","future research","CV","proteins","function","coefficient of variation"],"language":"en"},

Because T cell selection by peptide plus self-MHC in the thymus requires TCR engagement, we hypothesized that type 1 cytokines may polarize developing T cells. We cultured thymi from BBDR rats in adult thymus organ cultures (ATOC) under type 1 cytokine conditions in the absence of exogenous antigen. Type 1 cytokine-conditioned ATOC generated cells that spontaneously secreted high levels of IFN\u03B3, but not IL-4. A second exposure to type 1 cytokines further increased IFN\u03B3 secretion by these cells, most of which were blasts that expressed the activation markers CD25, CD71, CD86, and CD134. Studies using blocking antibodies and pharmacological inhibitors suggested that both IL-18 and cognate TCR\u2013MHC/ligand interactions were important for activation. Blocking anti-MHC class I plus anti-MHC class II antibodies, neutralizing anti-IL-18 antibody, and the p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor SB203580 each reduced IFN\u03B3 production by \u223C75\u201380%. Cyclosporin A, which prevents TCR signaling, inhibited IFN\u03B3 production by \u223C50%.

Interactions of the viral replicase complex with cis-acting RNA elements located in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-terminal genome regions ensure the specific replication of viral RNA. Over the past years, boundaries and structures of cis-acting RNA elements required for coronavirus genome replication have been extensively characterized in betacoronaviruses and, to a lesser extent, other coronavirus genera. Here, we review our current understanding of coronavirus cis-acting elements located in the terminal genome regions and use a combination of bioinformatic and RNA structure probing studies to identify and characterize putative cis-acting RNA elements in alphacoronaviruses. The study suggests significant RNA structure conservation among members of the genus Alphacoronavirus but also across genus boundaries. Overall, the conservation pattern identified for 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-terminal RNA structural elements in the genomes of alpha- and betacoronaviruses is in agreement with the widely used replicase polyprotein-based classification of the Coronavirinae, suggesting co-evolution of the coronavirus replication machinery with cognate cis-acting RNA elements.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Fricke, Markus; Marz, Manja; Ziebuhr, John","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/751ffc336c6d7846e4d9018ad8ad6234e06056ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114417.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25307890/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214004055; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214004055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cognate cis-acting RNA elements","putative cis-acting RNA elements","terminal RNA structural elements","current understanding of coronavirus cis-acting elements","specific replication of viral RNA","Abstract Coronavirus genome replication","coronavirus replication machinery","significant RNA structure conservation","structures of cis","terminal genome regions","coronavirus genera","viral replicase complex","genus boundaries","betacoronaviruses","genus Alphacoronavirus","conservation pattern","replicase polyprotein-based classification","multi-subunit protein complex","members","co-evolution","genomes of alpha","combination of bioinformatic","Coronavirinae","studies","agreement","lesser extent","study","alphacoronaviruses","past years","Interactions","dozen","cellular proteins"],"language":"en"},

(2012) The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257\u2013267. There are limited data on the use of masks and respirators to reduce transmission of influenza. A systematic review was undertaken to help inform pandemic influenza guidance in the United Kingdom. The initial review was performed in November 2009 and updated in June 2010 and January 2011. Inclusion criteria included randomised controlled trials and quasi\u2010experimental and observational studies of humans published in English with an outcome of laboratory\u2010confirmed or clinically\u2010diagnosed influenza and other viral respiratory infections. There were 17 eligible studies. Six of eight randomised controlled trials found no significant differences between control and intervention groups (masks with or without hand hygiene; N95/P2 respirators). One household trial found that mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenza\u2010like illness/laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction. One hospital\u2010based trial found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with non\u2010fit\u2010tested N95 respirator use compared with medical masks. Eight of nine retrospective observational studies found that mask and/or respirator use was independently associated with a reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Findings, however, may not be applicable to influenza and many studies were suboptimal. None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection. Some evidence suggests that mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection especially hand hygiene. The effectiveness of masks and respirators is likely linked to early, consistent and correct usage.","publish_time":"2011-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"bin\u2010Reza, Faisal; Lopez Chavarrias, Vicente; Nicoll, Angus; Chamberland, Mary E.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/963dfcc10563ef66cf366f73640ab9b3e84a9a55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5779801.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22188875/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission of influenza","use of masks","mask use","influenza infection","hand sanitiser use","pandemic influenza guidance","tested N95 respirator use","hand hygiene","Respiratory Viruses","medical masks","effectiveness of masks","eligible studies","observational studies of humans","retrospective observational studies","P2 respirators","systematic review","secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection","viral respiratory infections","randomised controlled trials","lower rate of clinical respiratory illness","initial review","reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome","based trial","household trial","outcome of laboratory","scientific evidence","package of personal protection","significant differences","intervention groups","English","Inclusion criteria","SARS","United Kingdom","conclusive relationship","education","correct usage","hospital","Reza","limited data","paper","bin","reduction","Findings"],"language":"en"},

Although Black patients present with later stage melanoma and have worse survival than non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients, the association between race and TTDS is unknown. Objective To investigate racial differences in time to melanoma treatment. Methods Retrospective review of the National Cancer Database (2004-2015). Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of race with TTDS controlling for sociodemographic/disease characteristics. Results Of the 233,982 melanoma patients identified, 1,221 (0.52%) were Black. Black patients had longer TTDS for stage I-III melanoma (p\u003C0.001) and time to immunotherapy (p=0.01), but not for TTDS for stage IV melanoma or time to chemotherapy (p\u003E0.05 for both). Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, Black patients had over twice the odds of having TTDS between 41-60 days, over three times the odds of having TTDS between 61-90 days, and over five times the odds of having TTDS over 90 days. Racial differences in TTDS persisted within each insurance type. Patients with Medicaid had the longest TTDS (mean 60.4 days), and those with private insurance had the shortest TTDS (mean 44.6 days; p\u003C0.001 for both).

We studied one mechanism by which vomiting is induced in pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) by characterization of swine EC cells by immunohistochemistry. Conventional or gnotobiotic (Gn) 9-day-old pigs [PEDV-inoculated (n = 12); Mock (n = 14)] were inoculated orally (8.9\u20139.2 log10 genomic equivalents/pig) with PEDV PC21A strain or mock. This is the first identification of serotonin-positive EC cells in swine by immunohistochemistry and mainly in intestinal crypts, regardless of infection status. They were morphologically triangular-shaped or round cells with or without apical cytoplasmic extensions, respectively. At post-inoculation hour (PIH) 16 or 24, when vomiting was first or frequently observed, respectively, PEDV infection resulted in significantly reduced numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in duodenum, mid-jejunum, ileum, or colon. However, two of three PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs that did not yet show vomiting at PIH 16 had numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in duodenum, ileum and colon similar to those in the negative controls. These findings suggest that serotonin release from EC cells (increased serotonin levels) into the gut submucosa might occur early PEDV post-infection to stimulate the vagal afferent neurons, followed by vomiting. Serotonin might be involved in the mechanisms related to vomiting in PEDV-infected piglets. We also found that mid-jejunum was the primary site of acute PEDV infection, and that systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were induced during the acute stage of PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil; Miyazaki, Ayako; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b506e20788c168d572bf9e48a54cb4573eb6085.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111759.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.06.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528818301498; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528818301498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29909130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","PEDV","PIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive EC cells","early PEDV post-infection","acute stage of PEDV infection","PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs","characterization of swine EC cells","round cells","serotonin release","Abstract Serotonin","identification of serotonin","PEDV-infected piglets","PEDV PC21A strain","primary site of acute PEDV infection","vomiting signal","reduced numbers of serotonin","increased serotonin levels","infection status","duodenum","gut submucosa","mid-jejunum","ileum","immunohistochemistry","day-old pigs","PIH","Mock","colon similar","post-inoculation hour","pro-inflammatory cytokine responses","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","critical monoamine neurotransmitter molecule","vagal afferent neurons","intestinal crypts","log10 genomic equivalents","enterochromaffin","apical cytoplasmic extensions","gnotobiotic","triangular-shaped","findings","negative controls","brain","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

No specific medicine or vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO2 and CO2 emissions and reduction in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues. Probably, the lockdown is one of the natural effects expected by nature via introduction of COVID-19. It is because, introduction of COVID-19 to nature was an outcome of mutation from two of its pre-existing forms, although, debate on it is still continuing. Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface type, temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard sterilisers is strongly recommended.

Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing. Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing. A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sullivan, Patrick Sean; Sailey, Charles; Guest, Jodie Lynn; Guarner, Jeannette; Kelley, Colleen; Siegler, Aaron Julius; Valentine-Graves, Mariah; Gravens, Laura; del Rio, Carlos; Sanchez, Travis Howard","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184968.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32310815/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPS","RNA"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["public health responses","sufficiency of specimens","NPS specimens","SARS-CoV","health care providers","serologic responses","effective public health response","laboratory testing","limitations","Health Insurance Portability","detection of SARS","self-collect sufficient specimens","diversifying testing modalities","specimen collection kit","lack of aggressive testing","Patient self-collection of samples","sufficiency of patient","Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection","collection of nasopharyngeal swab","viral detection","infection","COVID","pandemic","Participants","PPE-sparing options","sufficiency of biological material","coronavirus disease","telehealth session","telemedicine session","flexible options","objective measures","Protocol number","viral transport media","clinical decision making","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","personal protective equipment","IRB","Accountability Act","HIPPA","tools","Emory University Institutional Review Board","strong evidence base","United States","cornerstone","ability of patients","availability of swabs","compliant video meeting","suitability","screening","observation","conceptual framework","limited reagents","serology","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","date","RESULTS","efforts"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrate that CCL3-mediated neutrophil recruitment is coordinated by interferon-gamma (IFN\u03B3). Neutrophil recruitment in response to PVM infection was diminished five-fold in IFN\u03B3 receptor gene-deleted mice, although neutrophils from IFN\u03B3R -/- mice expressed transcripts for the CCL3 receptor, CCR1 and responded functionally to CCL3 ex vivo. Similarly, in the absence of PVM infection, CCL3 overexpression alone could not elicit neutrophil recruitment in the absence of IFN\u03B3. Interestingly, although supplemental IFN\u03B3 restored neutrophil recruitment and resulted in a sustained weight loss among CCL3-overexpressing IFN\u03B3 -/- mice, CCL3-mediated neutrophil recruitment alone did not result in the pulmonary edema or respiratory failure characteristic of severe viral infection, suggesting that CCL3 and IFN-\u03B3 together are sufficient to promote neutrophil recruitment but not pathologic activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a heretofore unrecognized hierarchical interaction between the IFN\u03B3 and CCL3, which demonstrate that IFN\u03B3 is crucial for CCL3-mediated neutrophil recruitment in vivo.","publish_time":"2009-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonville, Cynthia A; Percopo, Caroline M; Dyer, Kimberly D; Gao, Jiliang; Prussin, Calman; Foster, Barbara; Rosenberg, Helene F; Domachowske, Joseph B","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fba918741f8128e992b17b14c8a631b36801e3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2662797.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-10-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19298652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutrophil recruitment","CCL3 receptor","CCL3-overexpressing IFN\u03B3","CCL3 overexpression","CCL3 ex","absence of IFN\u03B3","supplemental IFN\u03B3","absence of PVM infection","IFN\u03B3 receptor gene-deleted mice","acute infection","pneumonia virus of mice","response","results","respiratory failure characteristic of severe viral infection","respiratory pathogen","fold","sustained weight loss","local production","IFN\u03B3R","neutrophils","proinflammatory chemokine","transcripts","CCR1","unrecognized hierarchical interaction","pulmonary edema","findings","IFN-\u03B3","interferon-gamma","pathologic activation","work","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The respiratory virus is a mutated form that may be a consequence of the gastroenteritis virus\u2019s evolution. Intensive passages of the virus in its natural host may enhance the appearance of mutations and therefore may contribute to any attenuated form of the virus. The objective of this study was to characterize the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus TMK22 strain after passages in piglets from 1992 until 2007. A typical experimental infection, molecular characterization, and serological analysis were also carried out to further characterize and to evaluate any significant difference between strains. The sequence analysis showed two amino acid deletions and loss of an N-glycosylation site in transmissible gastroenteritis virus S protein after passages in piglets. Although these deletions were positioned at the beginning of the antigenic site B of S protein, no clinical differences were observed in piglets infected experimentally either with the native virus or the mutated one. Serological tests did not show any antibody reactivity difference between the two strains. In this article, we report that the S protein deletion did not affect the virus\u2019s pathogenicity. The variety of the virus\u2019s evolutionary forms may be a result, not only of the multiple passages in natural hosts, but also of other factors, such as different pathogens co-infection, nutrition, immunity, and others.

The rapid evolution of viruses enables them to escape from natural immunities and from state-of-the-art antiviral treatments, with new viruses periodically emerging with deadly consequences. Viruses have also become powerful and are increasingly used tools in the field of experimental evolution. A growing body of evidence points that the evolution of viruses is mainly determined by key features such as their compacted genomes, enormous population sizes, and short generation times. In addition, RNA viruses also present large selection coefficients, antagonistic epistasis, and high mutation rates. Most of this knowledge comes from studies that have used either bacteriophages or animal viruses in cell cultures as experimental systems. However, plant viruses provide almost identical advantages for evolutionary studies and, in addition, offer an invaluable tool for studying the interplay between viruses and pluricellular hosts. Without seeking to be exhaustive, here we summarize some peculiarities of plant viruses and review recent experiments that have explored important questions on evolution, such as the role of deleterious mutation and neutrality, the effect of different transmission modes in the evolution of virulence, and the heterogeneous selective constraints imposed by multiple hosts.","publish_time":"2008-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elena, S F; Agudelo-Romero, P; Carrasco, P; Codo\u00F1er, F M; Mart\u00EDn, S; Torres-Barcel\u00F3, C; Sanju\u00E1n, R","journal":"Heredity (Edinb)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/430ac3df8f5852a0987cc68d8dc0e483cc7a20c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094686.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18253158/; https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.6801088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new viruses","RNA viruses","animal viruses","rapid evolution of viruses","peculiarities of plant viruses","evolution of virulence","field of experimental evolution","addition","experimental systems","multiple hosts","evolutionary studies","pluricellular hosts","used tools","high mutation rates","role of deleterious mutation","antagonistic epistasis","present large selection coefficients","enormous population sizes","compacted genomes","neutrality","state-of-the-art antiviral treatments","cell cultures","effect of different transmission modes","recent experiments","heterogeneous selective constraints","human","interplay","bacteriophages","identical advantages","short generation times","veterinary medicines","natural immunities","major threat","important questions","key features","invaluable tool","agronomy","growing body of evidence","deadly consequences","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Many \u201Crepurposed\u201D drugs, such as derivatives of thalidomide, antibiotics, and antivirals have had clinical success in treatment areas well beyond their original approved use. These include applications in treating antibiotic\u2010resistant organisms, viruses, cancers and to prevent burn scarring. The major theoretical justification for reusing approved drugs is that they have known modes of action and controllable side effects. Coadministering antibiotics with inhibitors of bacterial toxins or enzymes that mediate multidrug resistance can greatly enhance their activity. Drugs that control host cell pathways, including inflammation, tumor necrosis factor, interferons, and autophagy, can reduce the \u201Ccytokine storm\u201D response to injury, control infection, and aid in cancer therapy. An active compound, even if previously approved for human use, will be a poor clinical candidate if it lacks specificity for the new target, has poor solubility or can cause serious side effects. Synergistic combinations can reduce the dosages of the individual components to lower reactivity. Preclinical analysis should take into account that severely ill patients with comorbidities will be more sensitive to side effects than healthy trial subjects. Once an active, approved drug has been identified, collaboration with medicinal chemists can aid in finding derivatives with better physicochemical properties, specificity, and efficacy, to provide novel therapies for cancers, emerging and rare diseases.","publish_time":"2019-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schein, Catherine H.","journal":"Med Res Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e127d4a0c23e59e8f9c24aa988a81547e83f225.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7018532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31432544/; https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21627","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approved drugs","new drugs","effects","original approved use","human use","specificity","cancers","aid","poor clinical candidate","derivatives of thalidomide","poor solubility","clinical success","control infection","Coadministering antibiotics","new target","active compound","inflammation","inhibitors of bacterial toxins","injury","treatment areas","tumor necrosis factor","account","dosages","enzymes","interferons","resistant organisms","viruses","efficacy","response","host cell pathways","antivirals","better physicochemical properties","multidrug resistance","individual components","comorbidities","autophagy","cytokine storm","collaboration","groups","major theoretical justification","healthy trial subjects","lower reactivity","ill patients","novel therapies","cancer therapy","modes of action","applications","medicinal chemists","time","cost","rare diseases","burn scarring","search","therapeutics","Preclinical analysis"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two virus strains from each of six animal virus families, including both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, were lyophilized in (i) culture medium, (ii) with the addition of gelatine\u2013sucrose and (iii) skim milk\u2013sodium glutamate. All the virus suspensions were frozen (i) at \u221280\u00B0C or (ii) in liquid nitrogen before lyophilization. Virus titre assay after lyophilization and after 8 months storage at 4\u00B0C revealed that the efficacy of stabilizers depended on virus structure. Generally, the best protective quality for enveloped viruses was achieved with gelatine\u2013sucrose, which best maintained their infectivity and envelope morphology. Even additive\u2010free culture medium proved adequate for nonenveloped viruses. Differences in stabilizer efficacy were also found between virus families and were expressed immediately after lyophilization; the activity of stabilizers in the course of storage was very similar. Freezing in liquid nitrogen proved beneficial for picornaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of an appropriate stabilizer with respect to virus type is crucial for effective lyophilization.

The gut microbes are directly involved in conferring protection against pathogen colonization by inducing direct killing, competing with nutrients and enhancing the response of the gut-associated immune repertoire. Damage in the microbiome (dysbiosis) is linked with several life-threatening outcomes viz. inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, obesity, allergy, and auto-immune disorders. Therefore, the manipulation of human gut microbiota came out as a potential choice for therapeutic intervention of the several human diseases.

We conducted a comprehensive 9\u2010year study on HCoVs by analyzing 1137 respiratory samples from four subsets of patients (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A pan\u2010coronavirus RT\u2010PCR screening assay was performed, followed by species\u2010specific real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR monoplex assays. RESULTS: Human coronaviruses were detected in 88 of 1137 (7.7%) of the samples. The most frequently detected HCoV species were NL63 (50.0%) and OC43 (27.3%). Patients with comorbidities presented the highest risk of acquiring coronavirus infection (odds ratio = 4.17; 95% confidence interval = 1.9\u20139.3), and children with heart diseases revealed a significant HCoV infection presence. Dyspnea was more associated with HCoV\u2010229E infections (66.6%), and cyanosis was reported only in HCoV\u2010OC43 infections. There were interseasonal differences in the detection frequencies, with HCoV\u2010229E being predominant in the year 2004 (61.5%) and HCoV\u2010NL63 (70.8%) in 2008.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small peptide-based molecules of 5\u2013100 amino acids in length, with potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They are part of the innate immune system, which can represent a minimal risk of resistance development. These characteristics contribute to the description of these molecules as promising new molecules in the development of new antimicrobial drugs. However, efforts in developing new medicines have not resulted in any decrease of drug resistance yet. Thus, a technological approach on improving existing drugs is gaining special interest.

Total RNA was extracted from faecal suspensions and FCoV RNA was quantified using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle (C(T)) values were consistently high suggesting that the samples contained very little viral RNA. However, experiments in which RNA extracted from FCoV-infected cell culture supernatants was combined with RNA extracted from faecal suspensions revealed the presence of faecal factors that significantly inhibited the reverse transcription reaction. Consequently, three methods of RNA extraction were investigated and RNA dilution was undertaken to investigate whether the effects of the faecal inhibitors could be reduced. Our results show that using the QIAgen RNA mini kit for RNA extraction and dilution of the RNA samples helps to reduce the inhibitory effects. However, because the extent of the inhibitory effects varied between faecal samples, accurate quantification proved difficult. We, therefore, conclude that although real-time RT-PCR provides an excellent method for detecting the presence of viral shedding, quantification of FCoV RNA in faecal material has to take into account the possible effects of RT-PCR inhibitors. It is, therefore, essential that all new assays, and the methods of sample preparation, are carefully evaluated before being used in a clinical setting.","publish_time":"2008-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dye, Charlotte; Helps, Christopher R.; Siddell, Stuart G.","journal":"J Feline Med Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba7fc2e5541679edbb6be160fe327838f9762100.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f515f44d35d19b3aaae1c54bbaf6532b473a716e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2582154.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X07002124; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X07002124; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2007.10.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18243744/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA samples","RNA dilution","Total RNA","quantification of FCoV RNA","Faecal samples","methods of RNA extraction","little viral RNA","faecal suspensions","faecal inhibitors","faecal material","QIAgen RNA mini kit","presence of faecal factors","possible effects of RT","PCR inhibitors","inhibitory effects","real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","reverse transcription reaction","presence of viral shedding","FCoV-infected cell culture supernatants","accurate quantification","methods of sample preparation","endemic feline coronavirus","multi-cat households","cats","excellent method","account","values","high suggesting","infection","new assays","results","extent","experiments","clinical setting"],"language":"en"},

The localized delivery of siRNA to a specific site in vivo is highly challenging. There are many disease states in which a systemic effect of RNAi may be desirable; some examples include non\u2010localized cancers, HIV, neurodegenerative diseases, respiratory viruses, and heart and vascular disease. In this Concept, we will focus on the localized delivery of siRNA to a target site using various delivery modalities. In certain tissues, such as the eye, central nervous system and lung, it has been demonstrated that a simple injection of naked siRNA will silence gene expression specifically in that tissue. To achieve local gene silencing in other tissues, a variety of approaches have been pursued to help stabilize the siRNA and facilitate uptake; they include chemical modification of the siRNA or complexation within liposomes or polymers to form nanoparticles. Recently, the use of macroscopic biomaterial scaffolds for siRNA delivery has been reported, and although there is still significant work to be done in this area to optimize the delivery systems, it is an important area of research that offers the potential for having great impact on the field of siRNA delivery.","publish_time":"2011-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krebs, Melissa D.; Alsberg, Eben","journal":"Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d92a80ab2f7021b99480b2d83a1bbbc6791a3d2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21341332/; https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201003144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["localized delivery of siRNA","field of siRNA delivery","delivery systems","simple injection of naked siRNA","various delivery modalities","non\u2010localized cancers","local gene silencing","target site","specific site","gene expression","vascular disease","disease states","certain tissues","induced silencing complex","Short interfering RNA","important area of research","HIV","neurodegenerative diseases","respiratory viruses","eye","examples","heart","complexation","functions","systemic effect of RNAi","use of macroscopic biomaterial scaffolds","great impact","central nervous system","lung","potential","RISC","liposomes","polymers","chemical modification","uptake","variety of approaches","nanoparticles","cytoplasm","significant work","Concept"],"language":"en"},

By contrast with influenza viruses, little is known about the contemporaneous global diversity of these viruses, and the relevance of such for development of pharmaceutical interventions. Although far less advanced than for influenza, antiviral drugs and vaccines are in different stages of development for several of these viruses, but no interventions have been licensed. This scarcity of global genetic data represents a substantial knowledge gap and impediment to the eventual licensing of new antiviral drugs and vaccines for NIRVs. Enhanced genetic surveillance will assist and boost research and development into new antiviral drugs and vaccines for these viruses. Additionally, understanding the global diversity of respiratory viruses is also part of emerging disease preparedness, because non-human coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses have been listed as priority concerns in a recent WHO research and development blueprint initiative for emerging infectious diseases.

In total, ninety 7-d-old poults, which tested negative for the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, and reovirus by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR, were divided evenly into 3 groups: A, B, and C. Birds in group A were inoculated orally with turkey astrovirus-positive intestinal contents from birds affected with PES. Group B received turkey astrovirus-containing intestinal contents from apparently healthy flocks. Group C served as a negative control and was given PBS. Clinical signs of diarrhea, depression, and dullness were observed in group A. Birds in group B also showed clinical signs similar to those in group A, although the signs were milder in nature. Birds in group C did not show any clinical signs. At 16 d postinoculation, the BW of birds in group A was significantly lower than that of birds in groups B or C. In addition, the bursa size was reduced in group A, but not in groups B or C. Birds in groups A and B, but not in group C, were found to shed turkey astrovirus in their feces, as detected by RT-PCR. These results provide a preliminary indication that TAstV-2 from PES birds may be more pathogenic than TAstV-2 from apparently healthy poults. Further studies are needed to determine if pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of TAstV-2 exist in the environment. These results also reinforce our previous observations that astrovirus is involved in PES, causing significant retardation in growth and weight gain.","publish_time":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mor, S.K.; Abin, M.; Costa, G.; Durrani, A.; Jindal, N.; Goyal, S.M.; Patnayak, D.P.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e08c8aeba97ca5dd7b129f5991d50f482ba62c30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195392.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22080013/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119423420; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119423420; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps.2011-01617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PES","Group B","PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Group B","Group C","PES birds","groups B","turkey flocks","BW of birds","presence of astrovirus","turkey astrovirus-positive intestinal contents","clinical signs similar","Clinical signs of diarrhea","healthy flocks","apparent signs of infection","nonpathogenic strains of TAstV","RT-PCR","results","healthy poults","d-old poults","negative control","d postinoculation","coronavirus","poult enteritis syndrome","reovirus","reverse transcriptase","significant retardation","growth","comparative pathogenicity of type","weight gain","rotavirus","depression","addition","dullness","preliminary indication","previous observations","bursa size","feces","PBS","nature","experimental study","total","studies","environment"],"language":"en"},

This assessment evaluates the potential testing of oral fluid samples with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease for surveillance during a disease outbreak and early detection in a disease-free setting. METHODS: We used a series of logical arguments, informed assumptions, and a range of parameter values from literature and industry practices to examine the cost and value of information provided by oral fluid sampling and rRT-PCR testing for the swine foreign animal disease surveillance objectives outlined above. RESULTS: Based on the evaluation, oral fluid testing demonstrated value for both settings evaluated. The greatest value was in an outbreak scenario, where using oral fluids would minimize disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes by 23%-40%, and decrease resource requirements relative to current individual animal sampling plans. For an early detection system, sampling every 3 days met the designed prevalence detection threshold with 0.95 probability, but was quite costly. LIMITATIONS: Implementation of oral fluid testing for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease surveillance is not yet possible due to several limitations and information gaps. The gaps include validation of PCR diagnostic protocols and kits for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease on swine oral fluid samples; minimal information on test performance in a field setting; detection windows with low virulence strains of some foreign animal disease viruses; and the need for confirmatory testing protocol development.","publish_time":"2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beemer, Oriana; Remmenga, Marta; Gustafson, Lori; Johnson, Kamina; Hsi, David; Antognoli, Maria Celia","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8557b122155d371bbf43c23abf059b526da6496.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6634402.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["African swine fever","classical swine fever","swine oral fluid samples","Oral fluid sampling","finisher swine","Implementation of oral fluid testing","potential testing of oral fluid samples","swine foreign animal disease surveillance objectives","health status of swine","oral fluids","disease outbreak","mouth disease surveillance","rRT-PCR testing","foreign animal disease viruses","foot","value of information","disruption of animal","detection windows","information gaps","early detection system","confirmatory testing protocol development","current individual animal sampling plans","minimal information","greatest value","LIMITATIONS","designed prevalence detection threshold","validation of PCR diagnostic protocols","field setting","outbreak scenario","disease-free setting","low virulence strains","real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","kits","test performance","need","resource requirements relative","days","informed assumptions","industry practices","range of parameter values","literature","probability","farm activities","unobtrusive mechanism","grower","evaluation","series of logical arguments","cost","INTRODUCTION","sample sizes","assessment","settings","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics in Jiangsu Province and assess whether so-called wartime control measures changed the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province. Methods Epidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China\u0027s Bureau of Health and the People\u0027s Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020. Results The cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases. The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9. The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%\u201358.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined. The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17. The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou. The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people). The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province. The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases. Conclusion The number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined. This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ke-wei; Gao, Jie; Wang, Hua; Wu, Xiao-long; Yuan, Qin-fang; Guo, Fei-yu; Zhang, Zhi-jie; Cheng, Yang","journal":"Travel Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c4cf4696e04c54841d693ab185b9fd22e235e1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130124.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101654; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920301228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268195/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301228?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bureau of Health","Wuxi, Jiangsu"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["proportion of confirmed cases","number of daily confirmed new cases","Hubei Province","People\u0027s Government of Jiangsu Province","epidemiological features of COVID","cumulative number of patients","geographical distribution of COVID","temporal number of patients","days","Suzhou","epidemiological characteristics","longest incubation period of COVID","so-called wartime control measures","Methods Epidemiological data","population mobility","novel coronavirus","human transmission","trend of coronavirus disease","high population density","proportion of close contacts","residents","websites of China\u0027s Bureau of Health","Xuzhou","cities","informal online sources","inflection point","tourists","areas","travelers","dramatic reductions","lockdown","Conclusion","Wuxi","Abstract Background","result","Nanjing","onset of laboratory","study","maximum"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we investigated viral load, the immune response, and apoptosis in lung tissues from 50 fatal cases with 2009 pH1N1 virus infection. The results suggested that 7 of the 27 cytokines/chemokines showed remarkably high expression, including IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03B2, and interferon-inducible protein-10 in lung tissues of 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases. Viral load, which showed the highest level on day 7 of illness onset and persisted until day 17 of illness, was positively correlated with mRNA levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03B2, interferon-inducible protein-10, and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted. Apoptosis was evident in lung tissues stained by the TUNEL assay. Decreased Fas and elevated FasL mRNA levels were present in lung tissues, and cleaved caspase-3 was frequently seen in pneumocytes, submucosal glands, and lymphoid tissues. The pathogenesis of the 2009 pH1N1 virus infection is associated with viral replication and production of proinflammatory mediators. FasL and caspase-3 are involved in the pathway of 2009 pH1N1 virus-induced apoptosis in lung tissues, and the disequilibrium between the Fas and FasL level in lung tissues could contribute to delayed clearance of the virus and subsequent pathological damages.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Rongbao; Bhatnagar, Julu; Blau, Dianna M.; Greer, Patricia; Rollin, Dominique C.; Denison, Amy M.; Deleon-Carnes, Marlene; Shieh, Wun-Ju; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Patel, Mitesh; Liu, Lindy; Paddock, Christopher; Drew, Clifton; Shu, Yuelong; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Zaki, Sherif R.","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b18702fc4d911dbdff97f9ae5a4020e9a93bb80c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119452.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.06.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23938324/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944013004793; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944013004793","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung tissues","pH1N1 virus infection","pH1N1 infection","receptor antagonist protein","monocyte chemoattractant protein","macrophage inflammatory protein","lung parenchyma","pH1N1 fatal cases","pH1N1 virus-induced apoptosis","lymphoid tissues","interferon-inducible protein","mRNA levels of IL","FasL level","viral load","pandemic influenza H1N1 virus","elevated FasL mRNA levels","viral replication","day","host immune response","Decreased Fas","highest level","illness onset","Pathological studies","cleaved caspase","subsequent pathological damages","extensive diffuse alveolar damage","delayed clearance","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","disequilibrium","high expression","production of proinflammatory mediators","submucosal glands","activation normal T-cell","cytokines","chemokines","pneumocytes","pathway","TUNEL assay","pathogenesis","results"],"language":"en"},

Most, although not all, are zoonotic and have caused significant human morbidity and mortality. This final chapter will attempt to bring together a number of the common themes raised by these examples. These include the role of historical events in shaping the emergence of viruses in the present, the ability to retrospectively test samples to trace the emergence of disease and the technologies used to detect viruses. Technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction and mass sequencing have revolutionized virus detection and enabled the rapid identification and characterization of viruses. The application of these methods has led to the identification of new groups of viruses in samples obtained from a range of animal species without the need for invasive sampling or the recovery of live virus. However, with the detection of such a large range of viruses that exist asymptomatically with other species, the challenge now becomes the identification of those with the potential to become pathogenic for humans.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wakeley, Philip R.; North, Sarah; Johnson, Nicholas","journal":"The Role of Animals in Emerging Viral Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac89728a2ec18058f2cb718ce1f385e9125eb68a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150123.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124051911000120; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124051911000120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergence of viruses","characterization of viruses","large range of viruses","specific examples of viruses","identification of new groups of viruses","virus detection","samples","rapid identification","range of animal species","technologies","emergence of disease","animal sources","recovery of live virus","invasive sampling","mass sequencing","need","polymerase chain reaction","significant human morbidity","mortality","common themes","role of historical events","potential","ability","preceding chapters","humans","number","methods","challenge","final chapter","application"],"language":"en"},

Histopathologic examinations of the dead piglets showed characteristics of non-suppurative encephalitis, and some neurons in the cerebral cortex were degenerated and necrotic, and neuronophagia. Similarly, mice inoculated with PHEV-CC14 were found to have central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, with symptoms of depression, arched waists, standing and vellicating front claws. Furthmore, PHEV-positive labeling of neurons in cortices of dead piglets and infected mice supported the viral infections of the nervous system. Then, the major structural genes of PHEV-CC14 were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed, and the strain shared 95%\u201399.2% nt identity with the other PHEV strains available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis clearly proved that the wild strain clustered into a subclass with a HEV-JT06 strain. These findings suggested that the virus had a strong tropism for CNS, in this way, inducing nonsuppurative encephalitis as the cause of death in piglets. Simultaneously, the predicted risk of widespread transmission showed a certain variation among the PHEV strains currently circulating around the world.

A total of 154,553 patients obtained primary TKR surgery between 1996 and 2010. The diagnosis code for knee OA and the procedure code for TKR were selected from the records.

This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of PBB. Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with PBB, with an additional directed sample obtained from PBB patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R(2) = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P \u003C 0.001) and change in community composition (R(2) = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed among controls, in comparison with patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture. CONCLUSION: The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with PBB were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease burden.","publish_time":"2017-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuthbertson, Leah; Craven, Vanessa; Bingle, Lynne; Cookson, William O.

This study describes the clonal spread of a unique strain of MR-MP within a single family. On January 23, 2015, nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from the index case (a 9-year-old girl) in southern Italy. The patient had pneumonia and was initially treated with clarithromycin. MR-MP infection was suspected due to prolonged symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Two further cases of pneumonia occurred in relatives (a 7-year-old cousin and the 36-year-old mother of the index case); therefore, respiratory samples were also collected from other family members. Sequence analysis identified mutations associated with resistance to macrolides. Both P1 major adhesion protein typing and multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing were performed to assess the relatedness of the strains. The index case, the cousin, the mother, and another 4 family members (twin siblings of the index case, a 3-year-old cousin, and the grandmother) were positive for MR-MP. All strains harbored the mutation A2063G, had the same P1 subtype (1), and were MLVA (7/4/5/7/2) type Z. In addition, the index case\u0027s aunt (31 years of age and the probable source of infection) harbored an M pneumoniae strain with the same molecular profile; however, this strain was susceptible to macrolides. This cluster of MR-MP infection/carriage caused by a clonal strain suggests a high transmission rate within this family and highlights the need for increased awareness among clinicians regarding the circulation of MR-MP. Novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of M pneumoniae infections are required.","publish_time":"2016-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chironna, Maria; Loconsole, Daniela; De Robertis, Anna Lisa; Morea, Anna; Scalini, Egidio; Quarto, Michele; Tafuri, Silvio; Germinario, Cinzia; Manzionna, Mariano","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57917e0b169f8378708d74f4e3bfa47334416818.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4839953.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000003160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26986172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MR-MP infection","unique strain of MR","pneumoniae strain","circulation of MR","cluster of MR","year-old cousin","clonal strain","year-old mother","family members","year-old girl","single family","index case\u0027s aunt","pneumoniae infections","typing","MLVA","macrolides","strains","probable source of infection","clonal spread","Sequence analysis","Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae","sputum samples","respiratory samples","P1 subtype","cases of pneumonia","P1 major adhesion protein","multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis","years of age","prolonged symptoms","treatment","prevention","clinicians","high transmission rate","twin siblings","carriage","increased awareness","appropriate antibiotic therapy","need","mutations","resistance","addition","relatives","molecular profile","grandmother","mutation A2063G","Novel strategies","nasopharyngeal swabs","southern Italy","increasing problem","study","relatedness","patient","clarithromycin"],"language":"en"},

Expert guidance supports ECG monitoring to optimize patient safety. Objective To establish an enhanced process for ECG monitoring of patients being treated for COVID-19. Methods We created an SBAR (Situation Background Assessment Recommendation Tool) identifying the indication for ECGs in COVID-19 patients, and tagged these ECGs to ensure prompt over reading and identification of those with QT prolongation (QTc \u003E470 ms for QRS \u003C 120 ms, QTc \u003E 500 ms for QRS \u003E 120 ms). This triggered a phone call from the electrophysiology service to the primary team to provide management guidance and a formal consultation if requested. Results During a 2-week period we reviewed 2006 ECGs, corresponding to 524 unique patients, of whom 103 (19.7%) met SBAR defined criteria for QT prolongation. When compared to those without QT prolongation, these patients were more often in the intensive care unit (58.3% vs 35.4%) and more likely to be intubated (31.1 vs 18.1%). Fifty patients with QT prolongation (48.5%) had electrolyte abnormalities, 98 (95.1%) were on COVID-19 related QT prolonging medications, and 62 (60.2%) were on 1-4 additional non COVID-19 related QT prolonging drugs. Electrophysiology recommendations were given to limit modifiable risk factors. No patient developed torsade de pointes. Conclusion This process functioned efficiently, identified a high percentage of patients with QT prolongation, and led to relevant interventions. Arrhythmias were rare. No patient developed torsade de pointes.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Shashank; Workman, Virginia; Ganeshan, Raj; Obasare, Edinrin R.; Burr, Alicia; DeBiasi, Ralph M.; Freeman, James V.; Akar, Joseph; Lampert, Rachel; Rosenfeld, Lynda E.","journal":"Heart Rhythm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee42806d9d780ba4a36ec94a0ebe907249ba6626.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200355.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527120304215?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387247/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1547527120304215; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.04.047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QT","SBAR (Situation Background Assessment Recommendation Tool","QRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["QT prolongation","COVID","ms","related QT prolonging drugs","unique patients","ECG monitoring of patients","related QT prolonging medications","ECGs","high percentage of patients","SBAR","QTc","QRS","patient safety","vs","torsade","pointes","management guidance","Expert guidance","enhanced process","electrophysiology service","Electrophysiology recommendations","Abstract Background","Situation Background Assessment Recommendation Tool","treatment","primary team","ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease","indication","reading","identification","intensive care unit","modifiable risk factors","formal consultation","week period","prompt","criteria","relevant interventions","Results","phone","Objective","Methods","electrolyte abnormalities","Arrhythmias","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Influenza viruses evolve rapidly in sequence and undergo frequent reassortment of different gene segments. Homologous recombination, although commonly seen as an important component of dynamic genome evolution in many other organisms, is believed to be rare in influenza. In this study, 256 gene segments from 32 influenza A genomes were examined for homologous recombination, three recombinant H1N1 strains were detected and they most likely resulted from one recombination event between two closely rated parental sequences. These findings suggest that homologous recombination in influenza viruses tends to take place between strains sharing high sequence similarity. The three recombinant strains were isolated at different time periods and they form a clade, indicating that recombinant strains could circulate. In addition, the simulation results showed that many recombinant sequences might not be detectable by currently existing recombinant detection programs when the parental sequences are of high sequence similarity. Finally, possible ways were discussed to improve the accuracy of the detection for recombinant sequences in influenza.","publish_time":"2011-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Weilong","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99cc0233178fb1ede4d4f447dac746bcc3baeaeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127770.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111911001806; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.04.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111911001806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21571048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant sequences","recombinant strains","recombinant H1N1 strains","evolution of influenza viruses","Homologous recombination","parental sequences","existing recombinant detection programs","recombination event","high sequence similarity","frequent reassortment of different gene segments","important component of dynamic genome evolution","different time periods","place","genomes","organisms","simulation results","clade","accuracy","findings","addition","study","possible ways"],"language":"en"},

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society.

Based on our in vitro evidence of antiviral activity of interferon (IFN)-\u00DF activity against Ebola virus, we conducted a single arm clinical study in Guinea to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of IFN \u03B2-1a treatment for EVD. Nine individuals infected with Ebola virus were treated with IFN \u03B2-1a and compared retrospectively with a matched cohort of 21 infected patients receiving standardized supportive care only during the same time period at the same treatment unit. Cognizant of the limitations of having treated only 9 individuals with EVD, the data collected are cautiously considered. When compared to supportive care only, IFN \u03B2-1a treatment seemed to facilitate viral clearance from the blood and appeared associated with earlier resolution of disease symptoms. Survival, calculated from the date of consent for those in the trial and date of admission from those in the control cohort, to the date of death, was 19% for those receiving supportive care only, compared to 67% for those receiving supportive care plus IFN \u03B2-1a. Given the differences in baseline blood viremia between the control cohort and the IFN-treated cohort, an additional 17 controls were included for a subset analysis, from other treatment units in Guinea, matched with the IFN-treated patients based on age and baseline blood viremia. Subset analyses using this expanded control cohort suggests that patients without IFN \u03B2-1a treatment were ~ 1.5\u20131.9 fold more likely to die than those treated. Viewed altogether the results suggest a rationale for further clinical evaluation of IFN \u03B2-1a.","publish_time":"2017-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konde, Mandy Kader; Baker, Darren P.; Traore, Fode Amara; Sow, Mamadou Saliou; Camara, Alioune; Barry, Alpha Amadou; Mara, Doussou; Barry, Abdoulaye; Cone, Moussa 3; Kaba, Ibrahima; Richard, Amento Ablam; Beavogui, Abdoul Habib; G\u00FCnther, Stephan; Pintilie, Melania; Fish, Eleanor N.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97f1fe02cd9244df3c903856dcb615d9fb6ec02a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b420e61b7bad7118736507f69d3a255d5d171dea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5321269.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","EVD"],"locations":["Guinea"],"keyphrases":["IFN-treated cohort","IFN-treated patients","clinical evaluation of IFN \u03B2","therapeutic efficacy of IFN \u03B2","treatment of Ebola virus disease","matched cohort","treatment units","expanded control cohort","standardized supportive care","EVD","infected patients","date of admission","date of consent","date of death","baseline blood viremia","Guinea","individuals","\u00DF activity","evidence of antiviral activity of interferon","subset analysis","Subset analyses","approved antiviral drugs","single arm clinical study","earlier resolution of disease symptoms","safety","age","controls","time period","rationale","trial","differences","viral clearance","limitations","results","fold","data","Cognizant","Survival"],"language":"en"},

To date, no effective treatment has been identified and management for critically ill patients relies on management in intensive care units. Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Furthermore, the use of chemotherapy might have a negative impact in patient\u2019s outcome. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered. For each patient, several factors including age and comorbidities, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk. Each hospital around the world has issued some internal policy guidelines for oncologists, aiming to limit risks during this difficult time. We hereby propose a tool to support oncologists and physicians in treatment decision for patients with lung cancer. There are several variables to consider, including the extent of the epidemic, the local healthcare structure capacity, the risk of infection to the individual, the status of cancer, patients\u2019 comorbidities, age and details of the treatment.

This review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers \u2013 1) the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines, and 2) the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation. Nanoparticle-based vaccines, including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers, as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development. These include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens, target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells, enable cross-protection against divergent strains, act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained release of antigen, enable single dose delivery, and potentially obviate the cold chain. While mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases, they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic. An overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections, with advantages and disadvantages of each model, are discussed. Taken together, advances in nanotechnology, combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy, has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.; Narasimhan, Balaji; Mallapragada, Surya K.","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44113f3391248bc8e6737917ddf20ea938e4755f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/01f0ffeafb753f0a54cde6d40252d74b7c64f6b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4760633.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.09.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26410807/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365915301474; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365915301474; https://manuscript.elsevier.com/S0168365915301474/pdf/S0168365915301474.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacious vaccines","effective vaccine development","Nanoparticle-based vaccines","vaccine research","vaccine formulation","vaccine efficacy","subunit vaccines","respiratory infections","translation of new vaccines","development of nanoparticle","emerging respiratory infectious diseases","right animal models","mouse models","mechanisms of infectious diseases","choice of suitable animal models","overview of different animal models","barriers","key advantages","translational potential","significant need","natural polymeric adjuvants","cross-protection","specific immune cells","divergent strains","important insights","sustained release of antigen","immunomodulators","huge impact","single dose delivery","limiting step","disadvantages","combinations of antigens","human health","particles","carriers","nanotechnology","clinic","virus","ability","aspects","cold chain","review","advances","challenges"],"language":"en"},

Here we assessed potential antiviral activities of K22 against a range of viruses representing two (sub)families of the order Nidovirales, the Arteriviridae (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [PRRSV], equine arteritis virus [EAV] and simian hemorrhagic fever virus [SHFV]), and the Torovirinae (equine torovirus [EToV] and White Bream virus [WBV]). Possible effects of K22 on nidovirus replication were studied in suitable cell lines. K22 concentrations significantly decreasing infectious titres of the viruses included in this study ranged from 25 to 50 \u03BCM. Reduction of double-stranded RNA intermediates of viral replication in nidovirus-infected cells treated with K22 confirmed the anti-viral potential of K22. Collectively, the data show that K22 has antiviral activity against diverse lineages of nidoviruses, suggesting that the inhibitor targets a critical and conserved step during nidovirus replication.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rappe, Julie Christiane Fran\u00E7oise; de Wilde, Adriaan; Di, Han; M\u00FCller, Christin; Stalder, Hanspeter; V\u2019kovski, Philip; Snijder, Eric; Brinton, Margo A.; Ziebuhr, John; Ruggli, Nicolas; Thiel, Volker","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbba4d1840ca85dea4a5f2ccabd9cc5aa267e43a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114538.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.01.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217308560; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217308560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29337162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["K22 concentrations","nidovirus replication","anti-viral potential of K22","potential antiviral activities of K22","Possible effects of K22","equine arteritis virus","stranded RNA intermediates of viral replication","respiratory syndrome virus","viral RNA synthesis","White Bream virus","antiviral activity","range of viruses","simian hemorrhagic fever virus","nidovirus-infected cells","novel antiviral compound","Reduction of double","equine torovirus","broad range of animal","impairing double-membrane vesicle","EAV","PRRSV","Arteriviridae","DMV","EToV","order Nidovirales","SHFV","sub","diverse lineages of nidoviruses","conserved step","human coronaviruses","inhibitor","formation","families","Torovirinae","infectious titres","suitable cell lines","Lundin","WBV","data","study","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea has also shown super-spreading events with a significantly high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases. It becomes critical to understand the mechanism for this high level of heterogeneity to develop effective intervention strategies and preventive plans for future emerging infectious diseases. In this regard, agent-based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual heterogeneity into the epidemic model. In the present work, a stochastic agent-based framework is developed in order to understand the underlying mechanism of heterogeneity. Clinical (i.e., an infectivity level) and social or environmental (i.e., a contact level) heterogeneity are modeled. These factors are incorporated in the transmission rate functions under assumptions that super-spreaders have stronger transmission and/or higher links. Our agent-based model has employed real MERS-CoV epidemic features based on the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemiological data. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios. Our findings highlight the roles of super-spreaders in a high level of heterogeneity, underscoring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of infectivity are the most critical factors for substantial heterogeneity in generating secondary cases of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission.","publish_time":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yunhwan; Ryu, Hohyung; Lee, Sunmi","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5408b9cea3b1caf9f6cd026140d5414fab4c6e81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6265857.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15112369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high level of heterogeneity","infectivity level","MERS-CoV transmission","individual heterogeneity","substantial heterogeneity","contact level","higher level of infectivity","underlying mechanism of heterogeneity","MERS-CoV outbreak","Super-spreading events","agent-based modeling","real MERS-CoV epidemic features","stronger transmission","transmission dynamics","MERS-CoV epidemiological data","epidemic model","roles of super-spreaders","stochastic agent-based framework","transmission rate functions","secondary cases","critical factors","various epidemic scenarios","future emerging infectious diseases","higher links","preventive plans","effective intervention strategies","assumptions","useful tool","Republic of Korea","order","present work","Monte Carlo simulations","findings","number of contacts","regard"],"language":"en"},

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted because both medications cause corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation. Whether QTc duration significantly varies during the day, potentially requiring multiple ECGs, remains to be established. Methods We performed 12\u2011lead ECGs and 12\u2011lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged \u003C80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days. A group of healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as control. Results Out of 126 patients, 22 (median age 64, 82% men) met the inclusion criteria. ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02). Four patients had a QTc \u2265 480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p = .03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p \u003C .01) compared with those with QTc \u003C 480 ms. At 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, 1 COVID-19 patient and no control had \u22651 run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (p = .4). No patients showed \u201CR on T\u0022 premature ventricular beats. Analysis of 24-h QTc dynamics revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher QTc values than controls, with no significant hourly variability. Conclusion Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases. Because QTc duration remains stable during the 24 h, multiple daily ECG are not recommendable.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cipriani, Alberto; Zorzi, Alessandro; Ceccato, Davide; Capone, Federico; Parolin, Matteo; Donato, Filippo; Fioretto, Paola; Pesavento, Raffaele; Previato, Lorenzo; Maffei, Pietro; Saller, Alois; Avogaro, Angelo; Sarais, Cristiano; Gregori, Dario; Iliceto, Sabino; Vettor, Roberto","journal":"International journal of cardiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f600f950b28bb2445e49a74339c00d33fb8cff4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527320322233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439366/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.05.036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527320322233?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["QTc interval","patients","QTc duration","COVID","h QTc dynamics","longer QTc-interval","higher QTc values","h Holter ECG monitoring","multiple daily ECG","azithromycin combination therapy","Conclusion Therapy","oral therapy","vs","ms","multiple ECGs","lead ECGs","higher values of aspartate aminotransferase","corrected QT-interval","Abstract Background Hydroxychloroquine","alanine aminotransferase","median age","premature ventricular beats","run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia","controls","men","sex","medications","group of healthy individuals","significant hourly variability","coronavirus disease","medical unit","years","prolongation","Analysis","high levels of transaminases","inclusion criteria","Methods","days"],"language":"en"},

Over the years, host shutoff, the widespread down-regulation of host gene expression, has emerged as a key process that contributes to cellular takeover in infected cells. Interestingly, multiple mechanisms of host shutoff have been described in influenza A virus, involving changes in translation, RNA synthesis and stability. Several viral proteins, notably the non-structural protein NS1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the endoribonuclease PA-X have been implicated in host shutoff. This multitude of host shutoff mechanisms indicates that host shutoff is an important component of the influenza A virus replication cycle. Here we review the various mechanisms of host shutoff in influenza A virus and the evidence that they contribute to immune evasion and/or viral replication.

The case fatality ratio (CFR) is the fraction of cases that die after contracting a disease. The relative CFR is the factor by which the case fatality in one group is greater or less than that in a second group. Incomplete reporting of the number of infected individuals, both recovered and dead, can lead to biased estimates of the CFR. We define conditions under which the CFR and the relative CFR are identifiable. Furthermore, we propose an estimator for the relative CFR that controls for time-varying reporting rates. We generalize our methods to account for elapsed time between infection and death. To demonstrate the new methodology, we use data from the 1918 influenza pandemic to estimate relative CFRs between counties in Maryland. A simulation study evaluates the performance of the methods in outbreak scenarios. An R software package makes the methods and data presented here freely available. Our work highlights the limitations and challenges associated with estimating absolute and relative CFRs in practice.

To date, no information is available on F1 protein of Indian isolates, and hence detection of antibodies for F1 protein in Indian patients assumes great relevance. Specific primers have been designed to amplify sequence coding for 120aa of truncated F1 (tF1). The amplified tF1 has been cloned in bacterial expression vector, pET21b for expression in Escherichia coli. Partially purified expressed protein has been subjected to western blot analysis using patients\u2019 sera. Three HCV positive sera employed in western analysis showed positive signals to tF1, while sera from uninfected individuals failed to give any signals. Further, results of western blots, carried out with patients sera titrated with purified core protein, confirmed the presence of antibodies specific to F1. The positive signal observed for F1 in western analysis with HCV infected sera suggests that F1 protein is synthesized in the natural course of HCV infection in Indian patients as well.

JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5\u00B0. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 \u03BCg/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species. The virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species that is resistant to 10 mM EDTA, presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein, has a sedimentation value in sucrose of about 230 S for JHMV and 200 S for A59V. The species of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein that are sensitive to 10 mM EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein, are about 40\u2013100 S in sucrose for both viruses. The purified presumptive virion RNA is about 50 S in sucrose for both viruses. The major species of presumptive mRNA of both viruses is about 18 S with secondary species of about 28 S in sucrose. Denaturation of the virus-specific RNA with heat and dimethylsulfoxide does not appreciably alter the sedimentation profiles of either the presumptive virion RNA or mRNA species.","publish_time":"1979-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robb, James A.; Bond, Clifford W.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cd35285dc4881d52dbd8c1887576424a0457491.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682279904677; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682279904677","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHMV","BALB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of virus","virus-specific species","virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species","virus-specific RNA","Virus-specific intranuclear","A59 virus","viruses","presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein","mRNA species","Progeny virus production","Abstract JHM virus","secondary species","sucrose","synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species","major species of presumptive mRNA","EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein","purified presumptive virion RNA","cytoplasmic antigen","JHMV","intranuclear antigen","A59V","sedimentation value","sedimentation profiles","surface antigens","hpi","c3T3 cells","sedimentation properties similar","weanling BALB","clone of BALB","independent of cell fusion","neurotropic members","c mice","greater neurotropism","actinomycin D","concentration sufficient","hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae","development","presence","dimethylsulfoxide","heat","formation of syncytia","\u03BCg","hr","Denaturation","infection","kinetics","immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

These samples were initially obtained to survey for the presence of hepatitis E virus (HEV). RESULTS: Two virus isolates were retrieved by virus culture of 55 monkey faecal samples. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was successfully used to identify the viruses as the segmented dsRNA orthoreovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the Lopburi orthoreovirus whole-genomes revealed relationships with the well-characterised PRVs Pulau (segment L1), Cangyuan (segments L2, M3 and S3), Melaka (segments L3 and M2), Kampar (segments M1 and S2) and Sikamat (segments S1 and S4) of Southeast Asia and China with nucleotide sequence identities of 93.5\u201398.9%. RT-PCR showed that PRV was detected in 10.9% (6/55) and HEV was detected in 25.5% (14/55) of the monkey faecal samples. CONCLUSIONS: PRV was isolated from monkey faeces for the first time in Thailand via viral culture and LC-MS/MS. The genetic diversity of the virus genome segments suggested a re-assortment within the PRV species group. The overall findings emphasise that monkey faeces can be sources of zoonotic viruses, including PRV and HEV, and suggest the need for active virus surveillance in areas of human and monkey co-habitation to prevent and control emerging zoonotic diseases in the future.

Methods MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and Scopus from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020 were systematically searched for related published articles. In both electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: \u201CCOVID 19\u201D OR \u201Ccoronavirus\u201D AND \u201Cbrain\u201D OR \u201CCNS\u201D OR \u201Cneurologic\u201D. Results Through the search strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint. However, the authors scanned the reference lists of the included studies and could identify multiple references. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25% of the patients. Most of the studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-19 in general. Conclusion While neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have not been studied appropriately, it is highly likely that some of these patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have CNS involvement and neurological manifestations. Precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations.","publish_time":"2020-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asadi-Pooya, Ali A.; Simani, Leila","journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dde19b1474b821b81223a0b1dcbb9cd2a7bcc24b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151535.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116832; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20301684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299017/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20301684","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurological manifestations of COVID","neurological involvement","CNS manifestations","patients","CNS involvement","targeted documentation of neurological symptoms","following search strategy","included studies","systematic review","Abstract Objective","narrative review","related published articles","occurrence of central nervous system","electrophysiological investigations","reference lists","evidence","cerebrospinal fluid","key words","electronic databases","autopsies","severe illness","PubMed","SARS-CoV","title","multiple references","victims","Conclusion","Methods MEDLINE","role","authors","publications","brain","Results","coronavirus","study","Scopus","viewpoint"],"language":"en"},

One major obstacle faced by pathogens is the immunological synapse. To enable efficient replication and latency in immune cells, viruses have developed a range of strategies to manipulate cellular processes involved in immunological synapse formation to evade immune detection and control T\u2010cell activation. In vitro, viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 and human T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1 utilise structures known as virological synapses to aid transmission of viral particles from cell to cell in a process termed trans\u2010infection. The formation of the virological synapse provides a gateway for virus to be transferred between cells avoiding the extracellular space, preventing antibody neutralisation or recognition by complement. This review looks at how viruses are able to subvert intracellular signalling to modulate immune function to their advantage and explores the role synapse formation has in viral persistence and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission.","publish_time":"2018-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bayliss, Rebecca J.; Piguet, Vincent","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/620831ad78fde11d52ab3119bb3a524a8e74628d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6492149.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30123959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell transmission","viruses","cell activation","immunological synapse formation","role synapse formation","host cell machinery","immune cells","immune detection","human T","human immunodeficiency virus","immune function","lymphotropic virus type","transmission of viral particles","control T","viral persistence","virological synapses","cellular processes","antibody neutralisation","structures","intracellular signalling","latency","advantage","extracellular space","range of strategies","recognition","efficient replication","pathogens","complement","benefit","gateway","major obstacle","review","infection","order"],"language":"en"},

Diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. Therefore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. Technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were used to compare the qPCR assay with standard microbiological methods. The limit of detection was 5 to 20 DNA template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. SDs for positive controls were \u003C5%. The use of the qPCR assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. Diagnostic accuracy of the qPCR assay varied between 60% positive agreement with standard tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 100% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Negative percentage of agreement was \u003E95% for M. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus; whereas it was only 56% for Haemophilus influenzae. Multiple microbial agents were identified in 19 of 44 sputum and 19 of 50 nasopharynx specimens.

However, comprehensive studies of the viral aetiology of ALRI have not been conducted in PNG for almost 30 years. OBJECTIVES: To determine the viruses associated with ALRI among children living in the PNG highlands using sensitive molecular detection techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Pernasal swabs were collected routinely between 1 week and 18 months of age and also during episodes of ALRI, as part of a neonatal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial. A tandem multiplex real-time PCR assay was used to test for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses in samples collected from 221 young children. Picornavirus typing was supported by DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Recognized pathogenic respiratory viruses were detected in 198/273 (73%) samples collected from children with no evidence of ALRI and 69/80 (86%) samples collected during ALRI episodes. Human rhinoviruses (HRV) species A, B and C were detected in 152 (56%) samples from non-ALRI children and 50 (63%) samples collected during ALRI episodes. Partial structural region sequences for two new species C rhinoviruses were added to the GenBank database. ALRI was associated with detection of adenovirus species B (p \u003C 0.01) or C (p \u003C 0.05), influenza A (p \u003C 0.0001) or respiratory syncytial virus (p \u003C 0.0001). Multiple viruses were detected more often during ALRI episodes (49%) than when children displayed no symptoms of ALRI (18%) (p \u003C 0.0001).

Large animal models such as newborn pig, sheep and nonhuman primates have complex brain development more similar to humans, but these animals are expensive, and developmental testing of sheep and piglets is limited. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are born lissencephalic and undergo postnatal cortical folding to form complex gyrencephalic brains. This review examines whether ferrets might provide a novel intermediate animal model of neonatal brain disease that has the benefit of a gyrified, altricial brain in a small animal.

Observations in MS patients were consistent with the mechanisms found in the MS models, that is, increased pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 activity is associated with disease exacerbation, while anti-inflammatory Th2 cells and Tregs appear to play a protective role.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Fumitaka; Omura, Seiichi; Jaffe, S.

Using an in vitro model incorporating treatment of non-infected human THP-1 macrophages with recombinant EBOV sGP, this study sought to examine the impact of sGP upon key macrophage functions. Macrophage polarization and phagocytic capacity of activated macrophages were found to be unaltered by sGP treatment. However, treatment with sGP inhibited macrophage production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03B1 and IL-6 while the yield of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, remained intact. Interestingly, the migratory ability of macrophages was also diminished by sGP, potentially due to a decrease in expression of CD11b, a vital macrophage integrin. Thus, EBOV sGP may operate to diminish functional contributions of non-infected macrophages to increase the potential viral dissemination.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bradley, Jillian H.; Harrison, Ametria; Corey, Ashley; Gentry, Nathan; Gregg, Randal K.","journal":"Cellular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9d587239806b4c15ec6412ce1f03015c47d5e58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29195741/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008874917302186; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008874917302186; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2017.11.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sGP treatment","recombinant EBOV sGP","impact of sGP","sGP inhibited macrophage production","Macrophage polarization","functional contributions of non-infected macrophages","treatment of non-infected human THP","key macrophage functions","vital macrophage integrin","migratory ability of macrophages","anti-EBOV antibodies","phagocytic capacity of activated macrophages","infected animal models","pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03B1","infection","patients","serum","expression of CD11b","Ebola virus","secreted glycoprotein","potential viral dissemination","study","large quantities","yield of anti-inflammatory cytokine","decoy","Abstract","decrease"],"language":"en"},

Because of its significance in immune response, JAK-STAT pathway is often targeted by pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). PRRSV causes reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in pigs of all ages. A typical feature of the immune response to PRRSV infection in pigs is delayed production and low titer of virus neutralizing antibodies, and weak cell-mediated immune response. One of the possible reasons for the weak protective immune response is that PRRSV interferes with cytokine-mediated JAK-STAT signaling. PRRSV inhibits interferon-activated JAK-STAT signaling by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. The mechanism is that PRRSV non-structural protein 1\u03B2 (nsp1\u03B2) induces degradation of karyopherin \u03B11 (KPNA1), a critical adaptor in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. PRRSV also antagonizes IL6-activated JAK-STAT3 signaling via inducing degradation of STAT3. In this review, we briefly introduce JAK-STAT signaling, summarize the PRRSV interference with it, and provide perspective on the perturbation in the context of PRRSV-elicited immune response.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Liping; Zhang, Yan-Jin","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b051b580a97cbb8eec93a855a24676f6861ae2b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117332.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516304461; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.036; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516304461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28069291/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","context of PRRSV","PRRSV interference","JAK-STAT pathway","interferon-activated JAK-STAT","PRRSV non-structural protein","weak protective immune response","inflammatory response","cytokine-mediated JAK-STAT","IL6-activated JAK-STAT3","pigs","weak cell","respiratory syndrome virus","inducing degradation of STAT3","respiratory disease","reproductive failure","low titer of virus","degradation of karyopherin \u03B11","regulation of cell growth","nsp1\u03B2","delayed production","apoptosis","proliferation","differentiation","angiogenesis","signal transducer","sows","critical adaptor","KPNA1","immunity","antibodies","activator of transcription","pathogens","possible reasons","nucleo-cytoplasmic transport","nuclear translocation of STAT1","Abstract Janus kinase","typical feature","STAT2","perspective","ages","perturbation","mechanism","significance","myriad cytokines","review"],"language":"en"},

During this period, several changes in Acre\u2019s transport infrastructure and urbanization have been started. To reconstruct the process of dengue introduction in Acre, we propose an analytic framework based on concepts used in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to inform risk assessments in dengue-free regions as well as network theory concepts for disease invasion and propagation. We calculate the probability of dengue importation to Acre from other Brazilian states, the evolution of dengue spread between Acrean municipalities and dengue establishment in the state. Our findings suggest that the landscape changes associated with human mobility have created favorable conditions for the establishment of dengue virus transmission in Acre. The revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability.

Coronavirus particles contain three major protein classes, within which the polypeptides vary in number and molecular weight between species. The apparent size and shapes of coronaviruses can vary considerably. Coronavirus particles are spherical, although negatively stained air-dried particles are often pleomorphic. The morphology of coronavirus surface projections can vary considerably between different strains. The conventional structure on negative staining consists of tear-drop-shaped projections, although cone-shaped projections are also observed. In all these cases, the projections have the same length of about 20 nm. Other coronaviruses have short as well as 20-nm projections.

Therefore, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site detection of SARS-CoV is crucial for the identification and prevention of future SARS outbreaks. In this study, a simple colorimetric and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It can be visually detected based on color change and monitored in real-time with fluorescent signals. The performance of this assay, based on six primers targeting open reading frame (ORF1b) and nucleocapsid (N) genes located in different regions of the SARS-CoV, was compared with real-time RT-PCR assay using various concentrations of target genes. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay and therefore a few target RNA to 10(4)-10(5) copies could be detected within a short period of time (20\u201325 min). In addition, we established a multiplex real-time LAMP assay to simultaneously detect two target regions within the SARS-CoV genome. Two target sequences were amplified by specific primers in the same reaction tube and revealed that it was able to detect down to 10(5) copies. The standard curve had a linear relationship with similar amplification efficiencies. The LAMP assay results in shorter \u201Csample-to-answer\u201D time than conventional PCR method. Therefore, it is suitable not only for diagnosis of clinical test, but also for surveillance of SARS virus in developing countries.

Like many coronaviruses, MERS-CoV carries genes that encode multiple accessory proteins that are not required for replication of the genome but are likely involved in pathogenesis. Evasion of host innate immunity through interferon (IFN) antagonism is a critical component of viral pathogenesis. The IFN-inducible oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway activates upon sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activated RNase L cleaves viral and host single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which leads to translational arrest and subsequent cell death, preventing viral replication and spread. Here we report that MERS-CoV, a lineage C Betacoronavirus, and related bat CoV NS4b accessory proteins have phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and antagonize OAS-RNase L by enzymatically degrading 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (2-5A), activators of RNase L. This is a novel function for NS4b, which has previously been reported to antagonize IFN signaling. NS4b proteins are distinct from lineage A Betacoronavirus PDEs and rotavirus gene-encoded PDEs, in having an amino-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) and are localized mostly to the nucleus. However, the expression level of cytoplasmic MERS-CoV NS4b protein is sufficient to prevent activation of RNase L. Finally, this is the first report of an RNase L antagonist expressed by a human or bat coronavirus and provides a specific mechanism by which this occurs. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for evasion of innate immunity by MERS-CoV while also identifying a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2016-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thornbrough, Joshua M.; Jha, Babal K.; Yount, Boyd; Goldstein, Stephen A.; Li, Yize; Elliott, Ruth; Sims, Amy C.; Baric, Ralph S.; Silverman, Robert H.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21d0dff90077800702fb5a6502246e9d512b6fe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4817253.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00258-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27025250/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["L.

In this study, we aimed to design an epitope-based vaccine that can trigger a significant immune response as well as to prognosticate inhibitor that can bind with potential drug target sites by using various immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. Initially, whole proteome of CHIKV was retrieved from database and perused to identify the most immunogenic protein. Structural properties of the selected protein were analyzed. The capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity by T cell and B cell were checked for the selected protein. The peptide region spanning 9 amino acids from 397 to 405 and the sequence YYYELYPTM were found as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. This peptide could interact with as many as 19 HLAs and showed high population coverage ranging from 69.50% to 84.94%. By using in silico docking techniques the epitope was further assessed for binding against HLA molecules to verify the binding cleft interaction. In addition with this, the allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. In the post therapeutic strategy, three dimensional structure was predicted along with validation and verification that resulted in molecular docking study to identify the potential drug binding sites and suitable therapeutic inhibitor against targeted protein. Finally, pharmacophore study was also performed in quest of seeing potent drug activity. However, this computational epitope-based peptide vaccine designing and target site prediction against CHIKV opens up a new horizon which may be the prospective way in Chikungunya virus research; the results require validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.","publish_time":"2015-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasan, Md.

During the SARS epidemic, Toronto was included as a travel location in the SARS definition. The lack of preparedness at our facility became evident in June 2003, when a patient was admitted with a fever, infiltrates, and recent travel to Toronto. This admission revealed many failure modes in our system for identifying and containing SARS. Twenty-one healthcare workers (HCWs) had unprotected exposure to the suspected case. As a result, the HCWs were screened prior to reporting to work for the 10 days following their exposure. Improper handling of lab specimens delayed testing. The case eventually was ruled out as a SARS case. PROJECT: A multidisciplinary team was formed to conduct a root-cause analysis (RCA) of the potential SARS exposure. Several process failures were identified, from admission through specimen handling. The team recognized that the frequency of admitting a SARS patient was low; however, the potential health threat was high. Rather than conduct additional educational sessions, a SARS Toolkit was developed for the hospital units. The kit contained step-by-step instructions, visuals, and a notification list. The kit\u0027s built-in forcing functions were designed to move the process along, but not to rely on HCWs memory. The new process was tested in a mock SARS admission drill. Only administration and the RCA team knew about the drill. The drill was completed in 3 hours. RESULTS: The kit was activated immediately and key departments, including infection control, were notified. Personal protective equipment was obtained and the patient was placed in the proper isolation. Laboratory specimens were processed and handled appropriately. HCW exposure did not occur. The kit assisted in preventing exposures while allowing for patient care. A debriefing followed the drill and included all HCWs involved, administration, and the RCA team. The mock patient was able to provide additional information regarding objects with potential fomite contamination that were brought out of the room. LESSONS LEARNED: Preparedness for events that may or may not occur challenged us to create a process that would succeed. Overall, the kit proved its worth with well-defined instructions for communication. At any time, it could easily be updated. It was identified that some signage needed clarification, and changes were made to the kit. The kit has since been adopted by our system hospitals.","publish_time":"2004-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berriel-Cass\u2217, D.; Gorczyca, J.; Roth, L.

The novelty of our approach is the inclusion of fuzzy integral with Markov chain for sequence analysis in the alignment-free model. The method estimate the parameters of a Markov chain by considering the frequencies of occurrence of all possible nucleotide pairs from each DNA sequence. These estimated Markov chain parameters were used to calculate similarity among all pairwise combinations of DNA sequences based on a fuzzy integral algorithm. This matrix is used as an input for the neighbor program in the PHYLIP package for phylogenetic tree construction. Our method was tested on eight benchmark datasets and on in-house generated datasets (18 s rDNA sequences from 11 arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and 16 s rDNA sequences of 40 bacterial isolates from plant interior). The results indicate that the fuzzy integral algorithm is an efficient and feasible alignment-free method for sequence analysis on the genomic scale.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saw, Ajay Kumar; Raj, Garima; Das, Manashi; Talukdar, Narayan Chandra; Tripathy, Binod Chandra; Nandi, Soumyadeep","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdf5579d820bb3154dc31e2d72bce2fe3f39b1bf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/30d216d33a2ead14fe0230f40fd76f6ae2d3b79c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ad0d3c262412a85fc363d0d3aa42f2485c73a2b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6403383.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40452-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30842590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequence data","sequence comparison","faster sequence analysis algorithms","alignment-free algorithm","alignment-based method","fuzzy integral algorithm","feasible alignment-free method","alignment-free model","s rDNA sequences","inclusion of fuzzy integral","estimated Markov chain parameters","combinations of DNA sequences","benchmark datasets","in-house generated datasets","PHYLIP package","bacterial isolates","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi","AMF","possible nucleotide pairs","public databases","generation sequencing","frequencies of occurrence","limitation","high need","neighbor program","phylogenetic tree construction","new challenges","approach","similarity","plant interior","genomic scale","input","results","novelty","matrix","study"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the influence of stem 1 length on the frameshift process by measuring the frameshift efficiency in vitro of a series of IBV-based pseudoknots whose stem 1 length was varied from 4 to 13 bp in single base-pair increments. Efficient frameshifting depended upon the presence of a minimum of 11 bp; pseudoknots with a shorter stem 1 were either non-functional or had reduced frameshift efficiency, despite the fact that a number of them had a stem 1 with a predicted stability equal to or greater than that of the wild-type IBV pseudoknot. An upper limit for stem 1 length was not determined, but pseudoknots containing a 12 or 13 bp stem 1 were fully functional. Structure probing analysis was carried out on RNAs containing either a ten or 11 bp stem 1; these experiments confirmed that both RNAs formed pseudoknots and appeared to be indistinguishable in conformation. Thus the difference in frameshifting efficiency seen with the two structures was not simply due to an inability of the 10 bp stem 1 construct to fold into a pseudoknot. In an attempt to identify other parameters which could account for the poor functionality of the shorter stem 1-containing pseudoknots, we investigated, in the context of the 10 bp stem 1 construct, the influence on frameshifting of altering the slippery sequence-pseudoknot spacing distance, loop 2 length, and the number of G residues at the bottom of the 5\u2032-arm of stem 1. For each parameter, it was possible to find a condition where a modest stimulation of frameshifting was observable (about twofold, from seven to a maximal 17 %), but we were unable to find a situation where frameshifting approached the levels seen with 11 bp stem 1 constructs (48-57 %). Furthermore, in the next smaller construct (9 bp stem 1), changing the bottom four base-pairs to G\u00B7C (the optimal base composition) only stimulated frameshifting from 3 to 6 %, an efficiency about tenfold lower than seen with the 11 bp construct. Thus stem 1 length is a major factor in determining the functionality of this class of pseudoknot and this has implications for models of the frameshift process.","publish_time":"1999-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Napthine, Sawsan; Liphardt, Jan; Bloys, Alison; Routledge, Samantha; Brierley, Ian","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6162a37e174b484abcc61ca7bf6500025f37db6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126229.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283699926888; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283699926888","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bp stem","shorter stem","influence of stem","arm of stem","bp construct","frameshifting efficiency","length","stimulated frameshifting","Efficient frameshifting","frameshift efficiency","modest stimulation of frameshifting","frameshift process","class of pseudoknot","based pseudoknots","wild-type IBV pseudoknot","ribosomal frameshifting signal present","smaller construct","classic hairpin-type RNA pseudoknot","series of IBV","base-pairs","RNAs","slippery sequence-pseudoknot spacing distance","optimal base composition","single base-pair","number of G residues","genomic RNA","poor functionality","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","loop","implications","condition","predicted stability equal","models","presence","levels","experiments","situation","major factor","minimum","upper limit","stacked stems","Structure probing analysis","parameters","difference","structures","inability","context","constructs","attempt","conformation"],"language":"en"},

The highest flavonoid production (3018.31\u00B148.66\u03BCg/g DW) were achieved in IAN-treated ITHRCs under the optimal conditions of IAN spore concentration ca.104 spores/mL, temperature 30\u00B0C, initial pH value of media 7.0 and time 72h, which remarkably increased 6.83-fold relative to non-treated control (441.91\u00B17.35\u03BCg/g DW). Also, this study revealed that IAN elicitation could trigger the sequentially transient accumulation of signal molecules and intensify the oxidative stress in ITHRCs, which both contributed to the up-regulated expression of associated genes involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, IAN could be reused at least five cycles with satisfactory performance. Overall, the coupled culture of IAN and ITHRCs is a promising and effective approach for the enhanced production of flavonoids, which allows for the improved applicability of these valuable compounds in pharmaceutical fields.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiao, Jiao; Gai, Qing-Yan; Wang, Wei; Zang, Yu-Ping; Niu, Li-Li; Fu, Yu-Jie; Wang, Xin","journal":"Industrial Crops and Products","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47ac0a2946024dc9e39e66af22701e2989e015fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125528.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.12.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669017308324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288265/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926669017308324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IAN"],"organizations":["DW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAN-treated ITHRCs","IAN elicitation","coupled culture of IAN","Aspergillus niger","optimal conditions of IAN spore concentration","elevated production","time","enhanced production of flavonoids","\u03BCg","highest flavonoid production","g DW","pharmaceutical industry","pharmaceutical fields","active flavonoids","flavonoid biosynthetic pathway","immobilized live GRAS","non-treated control","tinctoria hairy root cultures","dried roots of Isatis tinctoria","plant-fungus co-cultivation system","initial pH value of media","effective approach","valuable compounds","transient accumulation of signal molecules","regulated expression of associated genes","notable anti-influenza efficacy","temperature","improved applicability","superior elicitor","oxidative stress","spores","fungi","cycles","satisfactory performance","study"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have demonstrated that mutant viruses emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens and that those viruses had higher genetic stability compared to their parental strains because they acquired resistance to random mutation. Thus, this strategy was explored to stabilize the PRRSV genome in the current study. RESULTS: Four antiviral mutagens (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, and amiloride) were evaluated for their antiviral effects against VR2332, a prototype of type 2 PRRSV. Among the mutagens, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil had significant antiviral effects against VR2332. Consequently, VR2332 was serially passaged in MARC-145 cells in the presence of ribavirin at several concentrations to facilitate the emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants. Two ribavirin-resistant mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22, emerged from serial passages in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin, respectively. The genetic stability of these resistant mutants was evaluated in MARC-145 cells and compared with VR2332. As expected, the ribavirin-resistant mutants exhibited higher genetic stability compared to their parental virus. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil effectively suppressed PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. However, ribavirin-resistant mutants emerged when treated with low concentrations (\u22640.2 mM) of ribavirin, and those mutants were genetically more stable during serial passages in cell culture.","publish_time":"2015-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khatun, Amina; Shabir, Nadeem; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Kim, Won-Il","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9718efa7298b28b740938eeca415b1703ec6f689.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4344762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25890207/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0330-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ribavirin-resistant mutants","presence of ribavirin","emergence of ribavirin","VR2332","antiviral mutagens","fluorouracil","MARC","cells","higher genetic stability","parental virus","PRRSV genome","suppressed PRRSV replication","significant antiviral effects","live virus","serial passages","respiratory syndrome virus","mutant viruses","parental strains","low concentrations","quick reversion of MLV","control","virulence","vaccines","lethal mutagenesis","RVRp22","RVRp13","safety concerns","resistance","cell culture","prototype of type","Previous studies","current study","pigs","summary","RESULTS","random mutation","BACKGROUND","azacytidine","amiloride","CONCLUSIONS","strategy"],"language":"en"},

The sequences of DENV isolated from Guangdong and other countries screened since 2005 were studied to establish molecular evolutionary databases along with epidemiological data to explore its epidemiological, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Causes underlying the occurrence of the dengue epidemic included importation and localization of the virus. The number of indigenous cases significantly exceeded that of imported cases. Dengue virus 1 is the most important serotype and caused the long-term epidemic locally. Based on the data available since 2005, DENV1 was divided into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Only genotypes I and V were detected in 2014. In 2014, an epidemic involving old lineages of DENV1 genotype V occurred after 2 years of silence. The genotype was previously detected from 2009 to 2011. Genotype I, which caused recent epidemics, demonstrated a continuation of new lineages, and a predictive pattern of molecular evolution since 2005 among the four lineages was present. The DENV isolated from Guangdong was closely related to those causing large-scale epidemics in neighboring countries, suggesting the possibility of its import from these countries. The lack of sufficient epidemiological data and evidence on the local mosquito-borne DENV emphasizes the importance of studying the molecular evolutionary features and establishing a well-established phylogenetic tree for dengue prevention and control in Guangdong.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jianhai; Li, Xujuan; He, Xiaoen; Liu, Xuling; Zhong, Zhicheng; Xie, Qian; Zhu, Li; Jia, Fengyun; Mao, Yingxue; Chen, Zongqiu; Wen, Ying; Ma, Danjuan; Yu, Linzhong; Zhang, Bao; Zhao, Wei; Xiao, Weiwei","journal":"Am J Trop Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/150e648964270067a1ea14caffbc3427f756dafb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6779206.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.18-0951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":["Guangdong","China"],"keyphrases":["dengue virus","dengue epidemic","Guangdong","molecular characteristics","dengue prevention","incidence of dengue","molecular evolutionary features","molecular evolutionary databases","sequences of DENV","old lineages of DENV1 genotype V","lack of sufficient epidemiological data","Widespread awareness of epidemiological","predictive pattern of molecular evolution","data available","long-term epidemic","neighboring countries","genotypes","continuation of new lineages","imported cases","large-scale epidemics","recent epidemics","well-established phylogenetic tree","number of indigenous cases","evidence","local mosquito","importance","control","importation","important serotype","possibility","occurrence","China","localization","largest outbreak","years of silence","date","patients","genome","Causes"],"language":"en"},

One case-control study has reported an association between susceptibility to SARS and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) in China. As the downstream protein of MBL, variants of the MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP2) gene may be associated with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in the same population. METHODS: Thirty individuals with SARS were chosen for analysis of MASP2 polymorphisms by means of PCR direct sequencing. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were chosen using pairwise tagging algorithms. The frequencies of four tag SNPs (rs12711521, rs2261695, rs2273346 and rs7548659) were ascertained in 376 SARS patients and 523 control subjects, using the Beckman SNPstream Ultra High Throughput genotyping platform. RESULTS: There is no significant association between alleles or genotypes of the MASP2 tagSNP and susceptibility to SARS-CoV in both Beijing and Guangzhou populations. Diplotype (rs2273346 and rs12711521)were analyzed for association with susceptibility to SARS, no statistically significant evidence of association was observed. The Beijing and Guangzhou sample groups were homogeneous regarding demographic and genetic parameters, a joined analysis also showed no statistically significant evidence of association.

Healthcare workers and visitors can serve as transmission vectors to patients. We hypothesized that improved family and visitor hand hygiene (FVHH) and visitor screening would reduce HARVIs by at least 25%. METHODS: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. RESULTS: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days. CONCLUSIONS: Adding interventions to improve FVHH and visitor management to existing healthcare worker prevention efforts can help reduce HARVIs in the NICU.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linam, W.

The dynamics of epidemic spread in large-scale populations are very complex. Further, human behavior, social contact networks, and pandemics are closely intertwined and evolve as the epidemic spread. Individuals\u2019 changing behaviors in response to public policies and their evolving perception of how an infectious disease outbreak is unfolding can dramatically alter normal social interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must take these complicated interactions into account. Mathematical models are key to understanding the spread of epidemics. In this chapter, we discuss a recent approach of diffusion in network models for studying the complex dynamics of epidemics in large-scale populations.

Further, using these models for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health policies leads to issues that are characteristic of big data applications.

With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is critical to develop computational methods for identifying in a timely fashion the protein-protein binding sites (PPBSs) based on the sequence information alone because the information obtained by this way can be used for both biomedical research and drug development. To address such a challenge, we have proposed a new predictor, called iPPBS-Opt, in which we have used: (1) the K-Nearest Neighbors Cleaning (KNNC) and Inserting Hypothetical Training Samples (IHTS) treatments to optimize the training dataset; (2) the ensemble voting approach to select the most relevant features; and (3) the stationary wavelet transform to formulate the statistical samples. Cross-validation tests by targeting the experiment-confirmed results have demonstrated that the new predictor is very promising, implying that the aforementioned practices are indeed very effective. Particularly, the approach of using the wavelets to express protein/peptide sequences might be the key in grasping the problem\u2019s essence, fully consistent with the findings that many important biological functions of proteins can be elucidated with their low-frequency internal motions.

This influenza A virus was the product of gene reassortment of 4 different genetic elements: human influenza, swine influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian swine influenza. In the United States, New York was the epicenter of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic. Hospital emergency departments (EDs) were inundated with patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) requesting screening for H1N1. Our ED screening, as well as many others, used a rapid screening test for influenza A (QuickVue A/B) because H1N1 was a variant of influenza A. The definitive laboratory test i.e., RT-PCR for H1N1 was developed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and subsequently distributed to health departments. Because of the extraordinary volume of test requests, health authorities restricted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hence most EDs, including our own, were dependent on rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for swine influenza. A positive rapid influenza A test was usually predictive of RT-PCR H1N1 positivity, but the rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B) was associated with 30% false negatives. The inability to rely on RIDTs for H1N1 diagnosis resulted in underdiagnosing H1N1. Confronted with adults admitted with ILIs, negative RIDTs, and restricted RT-PCR testing, there was a critical need to develop clinical criteria to diagnose probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia. METHODS: During the pandemic, the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital developed clinical criteria for adult admitted patients with ILIs and negative RIDTs. Similar to the one developed for the clinical diagnosis of legionnaire\u0027s disease. The Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic weighted point score system for swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia is based on key clinical and laboratory features. RESULTS: During the \u201Cherald\u201D wave of the swine influenza H1N1 pandemic, the diagnostic weighted point score system accurately identified probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia and accurately differentiated swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia from ILIs and other viral and bacterial community-acquired pneumonias. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs, the diagnostic weighted diagnostic point score system, may be used to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia.","publish_time":"2009-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, Burke A.; Syed, Uzma; Stroll, Stephanie; Mickail, Nardeen; Laguerre, Marianne","journal":"Heart Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8847ded80509ab05acb9ee8184434cc090c6ead.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119053.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956309002350; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956309002350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19944879/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.09.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Infectious Disease Division"],"locations":["Mexico","United States"],"keyphrases":["swine influenza H1N1 pandemic","avian influenza","human influenza","variant of influenza","Eurasian swine influenza","probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia","differentiated swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia","positive rapid influenza","presumptive clinical diagnosis of swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia","H1N1 diagnosis","rapid influenza diagnostic tests","novel strain of influenza","underdiagnosing H1N1","PCR H1N1 positivity","ILIs","rapid screening test","negative RIDTs","diagnostic weighted diagnostic point score system","clinical criteria","clinical diagnosis of legionnaire\u0027s disease","restricted RT-PCR testing","Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic weighted point score system","definitive laboratory test","predictive of RT","Disease Control","ED screening","extraordinary volume of test requests","QuickVue","Hospital emergency departments","health departments","United States","EDs","adult admitted patients","health authorities","hospitalized adults","laboratory features","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","different genetic elements","product of gene reassortment","epicenter","originating","wave","New York","critical need","Atlanta","bacterial community","Veracruz","virus","Mexico","Centers","herald","illnesses","spring","pneumonias","CONCLUSION","world","inability","false negatives","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Seven hundred and fourteen non-enterotoxigenic type A C. perfringens isolated from 133 calves with lesions of enterotoxaemia and high clostridial cell counts (study population) and 386 isolated from a control population of 87 calves were tested by a colony hybridisation assay for the \u03B22 toxin. Two hundred and eighteen (31%) C. perfringens isolated from 83 calves (62%) of the study population and 113 (29%) C. perfringens isolated from 51 calves (59%) of the control population tested positive with the \u03B22 probe. Pure and mixed cultures of four C. perfringens (one \u03B1\u002B\u03B22\u002B, one \u03B1\u002Benterotoxin\u002B and two \u03B1\u002B) were tested in the ligated loop assay in one calf.

The MPER in the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) envelope protein (Env) interacts with the lipid bilayers through a cluster of tryptophan (Trp) residues and a C-terminal cholesterol-interacting motif. The inclusion of the MPER N-terminal sequence contributes to the membrane reactivity and anti-viral efficacy of the first two anti-HIV peptidyl fusion inhibitors T20 and T1249. As a type I transmembrane protein, Env also interacts with the cellular membranes during its biosynthesis and trafficking. Here we investigated the roles of MPER membrane-active sequences during both viral entry and assembly, specifically, their roles in the design of peptidyl fusion inhibitors and the biosynthesis of viral structural proteins. We found that elimination of the membrane-active elements in MPER peptides, namely, penta Trp\u2192alanine (Ala) substitutions and the disruption of the C-terminal cholesterol-interacting motif through deletion inhibited the anti-viral effect against the pseudotyped HIV-1. Furthermore, as compared to C-terminal dimerization, N-terminal dimerization of MPER peptides and N-terminal extension with five helix-forming residues enhanced their anti-viral efficacy substantially. The secondary structure study revealed that the penta-Trp\u2192Ala substitutions also increased the helical content in the MPER sequence, which prompted us to study the biological relevance of such mutations in pre-fusion Env. We observed that Ala mutations of Trp664, Trp668 and Trp670 in MPER moderately lowered the intracellular and intraviral contents of Env while significantly elevating the content of another viral structural protein, p55/Gag and its derivative p24/capsid. The data suggest a role of the gp41 MPER in the membrane-reactive events during both viral entry and budding, and provide insights into the future development of anti-viral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Si Min; Jejcic, Alenka; Tam, James P.; Vahlne, Anders","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6a4aa79206219f2e1229c6ecc507078520466b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4521866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26230322/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134851","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral entry","anti-viral efficacy","MPER sequence","viral fusion glycoproteins","anti-viral effect","MPER N-terminal sequence","gp41 MPER","membrane fusion events","N-terminal dimerization of MPER peptides","roles of MPER membrane-active sequences","membrane reactivity","biosynthesis of viral structural proteins","membrane-active elements","C-terminal dimerization","C-terminal cholesterol","future development of anti-viral therapeutics","N-terminal extension","membrane-reactive events","pre-fusion Env","conserved membrane-active region","anti-HIV peptidyl fusion inhibitors T20","membrane proximal external region","design of peptidyl fusion inhibitors","Ala substitutions","residues","penta-Trp","penta Trp","pseudotyped HIV","Ala mutations of Trp664","motif","intraviral contents of Env","transmembrane protein","envelope protein","helical content","secondary structure study","Gag","juxtamembrane positions","class","p55","deletion","cluster of tryptophan","Trp670","insights","Trp668","T1249","helix","disruption","derivative p24","lipid bilayers","cellular membranes","alanine","human immunodeficiency virus","budding","assembly","biological relevance","capsid","trafficking","elimination","inclusion","data"],"language":"en"},

The conserved existence of a third stem\u2013loop suggested an important hitherto unknown function. Here we present new information describing structure and function of the third stem of the SARS pseudoknot. We uncovered RNA dimerization through a palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3. Further in vitro analysis revealed that SARS-CoV RNA dimers assemble through \u2018kissing\u2019 loop\u2013loop interactions. We also show that loop\u2013loop kissing complex formation becomes more efficient at physiological temperature and in the presence of magnesium. When the palindromic sequence was mutated, in vitro RNA dimerization was abolished, and frameshifting was reduced from 15 to 5.7%. Furthermore, the inability to dimerize caused by the silent codon change in Stem 3 of SARS-CoV changed the viral growth kinetics and affected the levels of genomic and subgenomic RNA in infected cells. These results suggest that the homodimeric RNA complex formed by the SARS pseudoknot occurs in the cellular environment and that loop\u2013loop kissing interactions involving Stem 3 modulate -1 PRF and play a role in subgenomic and full-length RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2012-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ishimaru, Daniella; Plant, Ewan P.; Sims, Amy C.; Yount, Boyd L.; Roth, Braden M.; Eldho, Nadukkudy V.; P\u00E9rez-Alvarado, Gabriela C.; Armbruster, David W.; Baric, Ralph S.; Dinman, Jonathan D.; Taylor, Deborah R.; Hennig, Mirko","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa021bfcf95acdbde556098bfd84e8a84c7948c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3575852.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks1361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23275571/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV Stem","SARS pseudoknot","subgenomic RNA","SARS-CoV RNA dimers","loop interactions","RNA dimerization","Messenger RNA","homodimeric RNA complex","full-length RNA synthesis","kissing","stemmed pseudoknot","palindromic sequence","PRF","complex formation","stemmed hairpin","unknown function","ribosomal frameshifting","severe acute respiratory syndrome","levels of genomic","physiological temperature","viral growth kinetics","role","coronavirus","cellular environment","type pseudoknots","structure","infected cells","silent codon change","pks","new information","results","analysis","presence of magnesium","conserved existence","signals","inability"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, we test the hypothesis that similarity of codon usage preference and the degree of matching between BSTVs and their hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs, which only need to coevolve with few hosts. We compare the patterns of codon usage in 255 virus genomes to test this hypothesis. Our results show that NSTVs have a higher degree of matching to their hosts\u0027 tRNA pools than BSTVs. Further, analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) infers that codon usage bias of NSTVs is relatively stronger than that of BSTVs.

The nucleoprotein of Lassa virus, termed NP, binds the viral genome. It also has an additional enzymatic activity as an exonuclease that specifically digests double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA is a strong signal to the innate immune system of viral infection. Digestion of dsRNA by the NP exonuclease activity appears to cause suppression of innate immune signaling in the infected cell. Although the fold of the NP enzyme is conserved and the active site completely conserved with other exonucleases in its DEDDh family, NP is atypical among exonucleases in its preference for dsRNA and its strict specificity for one substrate. Here, we present the crystal structure of Lassa virus NP in complex with dsRNA. We find that unlike the exonuclease in Klenow fragment, the double-stranded nucleic acid in complex with Lassa NP remains base-paired instead of splitting, and that binding of the paired complementary strand is achieved by \u201Crelocation\u201D of a basic loop motif from its typical exonuclease position. Further, we find that just one single glycine that contacts the substrate strand and one single tyrosine that stacks with a base of the complementary, non-substrate strand are responsible for the unique substrate specificity. This work thus provides templates for development of antiviral drugs that would be specific for viral, rather than host exonucleases of similar fold and active site, and illustrates how a very few amino acid changes confer alternate specificity and biological phenotype to an enzyme.","publish_time":"2012-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hastie, Kathryn M.; King, Liam B.; Zandonatti, Michelle A.; Saphire, Erica Ollmann","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e178386cc3ca613c695540267c215754c02f2abe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3429428.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22937163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","Lassa NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lassa NP","NP enzyme","NP exonuclease activity","termed NP","crystal structure of Lassa virus NP","Digestion of dsRNA","non-substrate strand","unique substrate specificity","nucleoprotein of Lassa virus","paired complementary strand","complex","alternate specificity","strict specificity","base","typical exonuclease position","active site","viral genome","double","innate immune system of viral infection","host exonucleases of similar fold","suppression of innate immune","nucleic acid","single tyrosine","single glycine","stranded RNA","amino acid changes","additional enzymatic activity","basic loop motif","biological phenotype","relocation","strong signal","preference","development of antiviral drugs","DEDDh family","templates","hemorrhagic fever","binding","Klenow fragment","immunosuppression","infected cell","work","splitting"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Health crises shock the population and overwhelm the health services. This article analyzes 30 years of health crises in Spain from a multifaceted perspective: population, patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, politicians, the media and other groups involved. The interaction among all stakeholders shapes the response and management of any health crisis. Heterogeneity of management and of health effects\u2013contributing to inequalities in health-is common. The participation and coordination of the health services is crucial in detection of the crisis and in modulating the population reactions. Public health services characterized by their low public profile could gain public influence by their role in coordinating politicians and the media when solving important health problems. Analyzing the mistakes and successes in previous crises together with risk and vulnerability assessments, research and drills are essential to give a quick and adequate response to future crises.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00E9rvas, Juan; Hern\u00E1ndez-Aguado, Ildefonso","journal":"Gaceta Sanitaria","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa05467eaf63025d7d3448cc09e486a1453fc0bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131072.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213911108000460; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213911108000460","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["health-is common"],"organizations":["Public health"],"locations":["Espa\u00F1a","Spain"],"keyphrases":["in health","The participation and coordination of the health","and management of any health crisis","crisis sanitarias","Abstract Health crises shock the population and overwhelm the health","Analyzing the","crisis futuras","crucial in detection of the crisis and in modulating the population reactions","Heterogeneity of management and of health effects","the media and other groups","public health practitioners","research and drills","in coordinating politicians and the media when solving important health problems","give a quick and adequate","years of health crises in Spain from a multifaceted perspective","in previous crises together with risk and vulnerability assessments","The interaction among all stakeholders","profesionales de salud p\u00FAblica","problemas de salud p\u00FAblica","low public","future crises","pol\u00EDticos","poblaci\u00F3n","gesti\u00F3n","could gain public influence by","characterized by","influencia positiva","servicios asistenciales","servicios sanitarios","demostrada escasa influencia","patients","clinicians","contributing","pacientes","m\u00FAltiple perspectiva","especialistas","cl\u00EDnicos","auditor\u00EDas","riesgo","simulacros","salubristas","Espa\u00F1a","an\u00E1lisis de respuestas previas","This article","autores","tratamiento","vulnerabilidad","ensayos","investigaci\u00F3n","periodistas","clave","medios de comunicaci\u00F3n","relevancia","sociedad","partes involucradas","demandas de ayuda sanitaria","respecto","interacci\u00F3n","coordinaci\u00F3n","l\u00EDmite","grupos de inter\u00E9s","sentido negativo","intervenci\u00F3n activa","nexo","experiencia personal","aspectos","publicaciones","informaci\u00F3n","participaci\u00F3n","punto","dispositivos","efectos","detecci\u00F3n","common","errores","\u00E9xitos","conjunto","desigualdades","retos"],"language":"es"},

In this study we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the inhibition of BX-795 on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. HEC-1-A or Vero cells were treated with BX-795 and infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 for different periods. BX-795 (3.125-25 \u03BCmol/L) dose-dependently suppressed HSV-2 replication, and displayed a low cytotoxicity to the host cells. BX-795 treatment dose-dependently suppressed the expression of two HSV immediate-early (IE) genes (ICP0 and ICP27) and the late gene (gD) at 12 h postinfection. HSV-2 infection resulted in the activation of PI3K and Akt in the host cells, and BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced Akt phosphorylation and activation. However, the blockage of PI3K/Akt/mTOR with LY294002 and rapamycin did not affect HSV-2 replication. HSV-2 infection increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, and reduced ERK phosphorylation at 8 h postinfection in the host cells; BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase as well as the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2, the downstream targets of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) or SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) dose-dependently inhibited the viral replication in the host cells, whereas PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) was not effective. Moreover, BX-795 blocked PMA-stimulated c-Jun activation as well as HSV-2-mediated c-Jun nuclear translocation. BX-795 dose-dependently inhibited HSV-2, PMA, TNF-\u03B1-stimulated AP-1 activation, but not HSV-induced NF-\u03BAB activation. Overexpression of p38/JNK attenuated the inhibitory effect of BX-795 on HSV replication. BX-795 completely blocked HSV-2-induced MKK4 phosphorylation, suggesting that BX-795 acting upstream of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. In conclusion, this study identifies the anti-HSV activity of BX-795 and its targeting of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways in host cells.","publish_time":"2017-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Ai-rong; Qiu, Min; Li, Yan-lei; Xu, Wen-tao; Song, Si-wei; Wang, Xiao-hui; Song, Hong-yong; Zheng, Nan; Wu, Zhi-wei","journal":"Acta Pharmacologica Sinica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21cc67d7621201e72ce2fa654581cba5b4d301c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5342671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28112176/; https://www.nature.com/articles/aps2016160.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/aps.2016.160","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero","HSV","PI3K/Akt","JNK","PMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV replication","inhibited HSV","blocked HSV","suppressed HSV","anti-HSV activity of BX","inhibition of BX","phosphorylation of JNK","JNK inhibitor","p38 inhibitor","HSV immediate-early","induced activation of JNK","HSV-induced NF-\u03BAB activation","host cells","inhibitory effect of BX","p38 MAP kinase pathways","TANKbinding kinase","induced Akt phosphorylation","Overexpression of p38","activation of PI3K","phosphorylation of c","Vero cells","ERK inhibitor","treatment dose","induced MKK4 phosphorylation","IKK-related kinase","downstream targets of JNK","phosphoinositide-dependent kinase","potent inhibitor","viral replication","reduced ERK phosphorylation","blocked PMA-stimulated c","h postinfection","mediated c","study","stimulated AP","blockage of PI3K","Herpes simplex virus","mTOR","TNF-\u03B1","LY294002","SP600125","ICP27","ICP0","genes","late gene","gD","PDK1","ATF","rapamycin","TBK1","low cytotoxicity","PD98059","targeting","molecular mechanism","nuclear translocation","conclusion","IKK\u025B","different periods","SB203580","HEC","\u03BCmol"],"language":"en"},

Clinical features of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) include atypical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection. Here, we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct MERS-CoV strains obtained from human patients, MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1. RESULTS: Using topological techniques, including persistence homology and filtered clustering, we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of human Calu-3 cell host responses to the different MERS-CoV strains, with MERS-CoV Eng 1 inducing early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours post infection, compared to MERS-CoV SA 1. Robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two MERS-CoV strains predominantly at the late time points. Combining statistical analysis of infection and cytokine-stimulated Calu-3 transcriptomics, we identified differential innate responses, including up-regulation of extracellular remodeling genes following MERS-CoV Eng 1 infection and differential pro-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: Through our genomics-based approach, we found topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1, with differential expression of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of IFN, TNF and IL-1\u03B1 signaling. Predicted activation for STAT3 mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial cell-to-cell adherens and junction signaling in MERS-CoV Eng 1 infection suggest that these transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection.

Abstract Introduction Diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in newborns is difficult; however, this diagnosis is performed by cell culture or by detection of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis. Detection of C. trachomatis DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes using polymer chain reaction (PCR) may be a better tool for the diagnosis of infection by this pathogen. Material and methods A total of 44 premature newborns, all weighing less than 2500g, were included in the study. A blood sample and nasopharyngeal lavages were obtained from each newborn. Leukocyte DNA was obtained by phenol-chloroform extraction technique. Detection of C. trachomatis was performed by amplifying the ompA gene using the PCR endpoint. Cell culture tests and the detection of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis by microimmunofluorescence assay were also performed. Results Twenty newborns were PCR-positive (45.5%), with this test being significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia (RR=2.28; 95%CI: 1.01 to 5.17; P =.035). The cell culture of nasopharyngeal lavage was positive in only 7 samples and no significant association was observed with any clinical or laboratory data. The titer of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis associated with PCR-positive was 1:32 (RR=2.74; 95%CI: 1.21 to 6.23; P =.008), however this titer was not associated with the presence of pneumonia. Conclusion DNA detection in peripheral blood leukocytes could be useful for diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Hurtado, Marcela; Cuevas-Recillas, Karla N.; Flores-Salazar, Ver\u00F3nica R.; Guerra-Infante, Fernando M.","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b03b3df01220d5d440baf6f7542407c047c28ab9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103315.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X1400353X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X1400353X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["De","La detecci\u00F3n de C.","Resultados Veinte"],"organizations":["El diagn\u00F3stico de infecci\u00F3n por Chlamydia","Conclusi\u00F3n La detecci\u00F3n de ADN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trachomatis DNA","trachomatis en leucocitos","trachomatis fue llevada","PCR-positive","PCR-positivo fue","detecci\u00F3n","sangre y","PCR endpoint","detection of IgM antibodies","muestras y","cultivo celular y","anticuerpos IgM anti-CT mediante","Abstract Introduction Diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection","este se realiza mediante","ADN en leucocitos","infecci\u00F3n por Chlamydia trachomatis es dif\u00EDcil en reci\u00E9n nacidos","se realizaron","diagnosis of infection","titer of IgM antibodies","Material y m\u00E9todos Se analizaron","sangre mediante reacci\u00F3n en cadena","diagn\u00F3stico","cabo mediante","cultivo celular o por","Conclusion DNA detection","lavado nasofar\u00EDngeo solo fue positivo en","los leucocitos fue obtenido mediante","infecci\u00F3n por este pat\u00F3geno","anticuerpos anti-CT asociado","prueba se asoci\u00F3 significativamente","este t\u00EDtulo","Resultados Veinte pacientes fueron PCR-positivo","peripheral blood leukocytes","Cell culture tests","todos ellos prematuros y","cell culture of nasopharyngeal lavage","cada paciente se obtuvieron muestras","sin embargo","t\u00E9cnica","blood sample","presencia","Leukocyte DNA","neumon\u00EDa","premature newborns","presence of pneumonia","IC95","sangre perif\u00E9rica podr\u00EDa ser \u00FAtil para","podr\u00EDa ser una mejor herramienta para","ompA gene","nasopharyngeal lavages","gen ompA utilizando","alg\u00FAn dato cl\u00EDnico o","hubo asociaci\u00F3n significativa","amplificaci\u00F3n","polimerasa","pruebas","polymer chain reaction","peso menor","punto final","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","laboratorio","samples","methods","total","fenol-cloroformo","better tool","phenol-chloroform extraction technique","microinmunofluorescencia","Conclusi\u00F3n","microimmunofluorescence assay","significant association","Adem\u00E1s","Results","laboratory data","pathogen","study"],"language":"en"},

However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading.

IFITM3 is known to be essential for restriction of influenza virus infections in both mice and humans. Vertebrate IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a primitive unicellular eukaryote. Since bacterial IFITMs share minimal amino acid identity with human IFITM3, we hypothesized that examination of bacterial IFITMs in human cells would provide insight into the essential characteristics necessary for antiviral activity of IFITMs. We examined IFITMs from Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus for potential antiviral activity. Both of these IFITMs conferred a moderate level of resistance to influenza virus in human cells, identifying them as functional homologues of IFITM3. Analysis of sequence elements shared by bacterial IFITMs and IFITM3 identified two hydrophobic domains, putative S-palmitoylation sites, and conserved phenylalanine residues associated with IFITM3 interactions, which are all necessary for IFITM3 antiviral activity. We observed that, like IFITM3, bacterial IFITMs were S-palmitoylated, albeit to a lesser degree. We also demonstrated the ability of a bacterial IFITM to co-immunoprecipitate with IFITM3 suggesting formation of a complex, and also visualized strong co-localization of bacterial IFITMs with IFITM3. However, the mycobacterial IFITMs lack the endocytic-targeting motif conserved in vertebrate IFITM3. As such, these bacterial proteins, when expressed alone, had diminished colocalization with cathepsin B-positive endolysosomal compartments that are the primary site of IFITM3-dependent influenza virus restriction. Though the precise evolutionary origin of vertebrate IFITMs is not known, our results support a model whereby transfer of a bacterial IFITM gene to eukaryotic cells may have provided a selective advantage against viral infection that was refined through the course of vertebrate evolution to include more robust signals for S-palmitoylation and localization to sites of endocytic virus trafficking.","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melvin, William J.; McMichael, Temet M.; Chesarino, Nicholas M.; Hach, Jocelyn C.; Yount, Jacob S.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b02612aa65049060e0a24064db96105458ac083b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4488726.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26075508/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7062759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vertebrate IFITM3","examination of bacterial IFITMs","human IFITM3","mycobacterial IFITMs","antiviral activity of IFITMs","IFITM3 interactions","IFITM3 antiviral activity","strong co-localization of bacterial IFITMs","bacterial proteins","primary site of IFITM3","functional homologues of IFITM3","bacterial IFITM gene","precise evolutionary origin of vertebrate IFITMs","human cells","restriction of influenza virus infections","dependent influenza virus restriction","potential antiviral activity","sites of endocytic virus trafficking","putative S-palmitoylation sites","eukaryotic cells","S-palmitoylated","course of vertebrate evolution","essential characteristics necessary","horizontal gene transfer","Mycobacterium abscessus","Mycobacterium avium","co-immunoprecipitate","transmembrane proteins","conserved phenylalanine residues","minimal amino acid identity","hydrophobic domains","cathepsin B-positive endolysosomal compartments","insight","moderate level of resistance","robust signals","vertebrates","diminished colocalization","selective advantage","primitive unicellular eukaryote","formation","complex","mice","Analysis of sequence elements","motif","viral infection","specific viruses","humans","model","Interferon","ability","lesser degree","results"],"language":"en"},

While IFN\u03B3 alone was not able to induce HSD11B1, it could increase the activity of NF-kB and thus augment the upregulation of HSD11B1 by TNF\u03B1. Interestingly, the upregulation of HSD11B1 by IFN\u03B3 and TNF\u03B1 also required glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, HSD11B1 was shown to be required for the expression of TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), an important anti-inflammatory effector molecule of MSCs. Therefore, the inflammatory factors IFN\u03B3 and TNF\u03B1 can promote GC metabolism and thereby drive the expression of anti-inflammatory factor TSG-6 in human UC-MSCs, forming a potential negative feedback loop.

We tested these tissue specimens by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gel-based PCR. We selected some PCR positive samples for isolation in the embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). We sequenced some PCR-positive samples and conducted phylogenetic analysis based on the obtained sequences. RESULTS: Our molecular surveillance revealed that 31.6% of the tested specimens were IBV positive by PCR. We selected some positive specimens showing low Ct values by the qRT-PCR for virus isolation by the ECE. The infected eggs showed hemorrhage, dwarfing, and death in some cases after three passages in the ECE. We sequenced some of the positive PCR specimens and used the obtained sequences to draw the phylogenetic tree based on the partial IBV-ORF-1a, N, and S1 gene sequences.

RESULTS: BLVRA treatment alleviated GMH-induced developmental delay and attenuated splenic atrophy at 1 and 3 days after GMH. Quantification analysis showed that spleen-stored peripheral immune cells mobilized into circulation and infiltrated in the brain following GMH, which was abrogated by BLVRA administration, resulting in reduced splenic inflammatory response. Furthermore, we showed that regulation of eNOS/NO signaling by BLVRA stimulation blunted toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) signal. The eNOS-generated NO, in part, translocated BLVRA into the nucleus, where BLVRA inhibited TLR4 expression. CONCLUSION: We revealed a BLVRA-dependent signaling pathway in modulating the splenic inflammation in response to GMH via the eNOS/NO/TLR4 pathway.","publish_time":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yiting; Ding, Yan; Lu, Tai; Zhang, Yixin; Xu, Ningbo; McBride, Devin W.; Tang, Jiping; Zhang, John H.","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd1e95e046ac945ddbd0a1a515dcabf031f31244.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5910618.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1155-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GMH","BLVRA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["splenic response","BLVRA administration","translocated BLVRA","BLVRA-dependent","BLVRA treatment alleviated GMH","splenic inflammation","splenic weights","reduced splenic inflammatory response","BLVRA inhibited TLR4 expression","brain damage","brain tissues","Spleen","BLVRA stimulation blunted toll","attenuated splenic atrophy","collagenase GMH model","TLR4 pathway","secondary brain injury","receptor","peripheral immune cells","eNOS-generated","regulation of eNOS","inflammatory responses","critical role","protein levels of toll","mechanistic role of biliverdin reductase","developmental delay","high morbidity","neonates","mortality","common neurologic event","nucleus","current study","Germinal matrix hemorrhage","preterm infants","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","circulation","infiltration","Neurological outcomes","days","proinflammatory cytokines","Quantification analysis","Neutrophil production","METHODS","Western blot","signal","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

It has become apparent that older individuals have a greater risk of developing severe COVID-19, and compared to younger adults, the elderly have lower levels of vitamin D due to a variety of biological and behavioral factors. Older adults are also more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD), with advanced age being the single greatest risk factor. In addition to its immune-system-modulating effects, it has been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing PD progression and improving PD-related quality of life. We completed a review of the literature to determine the relationship between vitamin D, PD, and COVID-19.

Prior work has demonstrated that a visual scoring system applied to chest radiographs (CXR) is associated with adverse outcomes in ICU patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative CXR score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general ICU population, regardless of underlying diagnosis. METHODS: All individuals enrolled in the Registry of Critical Illness at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital between June 2008 and August 2018 who had a CXR within 24 h of admission were included. Each patient\u2019s CXR was assigned an opacification score of 0\u20134 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. Multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and APACHE II scores, were used to assess the total score\u2019s association with ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 560 patients were included. Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05\u20131.16, p \u003C 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07\u20131.17, p \u003C 0.001).

Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of virus-interacting proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9900 proteins conserved in all sequenced mammalian genomes. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins within the cellular functions they interact with and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. We conservatively estimate that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Our results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.

However, C. jejuni has been implicated in ovine abortion cases worldwide. Specifically, in the USA, the C. jejuni sheep abortion (SA) clone has been increasingly associated with sheep abortion. In vivo studies in sheep (the natural host) are needed to better characterize the virulence potential and pathogenesis of this clone. RESULTS: Pregnant ewes intravenously (IV) or orally inoculated with ovine or bovine abortion-associated C. jejuni SA clones exhibited partial or complete uterine prolapse with retained placenta, and abortion or stillbirth, whereas delivery of healthy lambs occurred in pregnant ewes inoculated with C. jejuni 81\u2013176 or in the uninfected group. In sheep inoculated with the SA clone, histopathological lesions including suppurative necrotizing placentitis and/or endometritis coincided with: 1) increased apoptotic death of trophoblasts, 2) increased expression of the host genes (e.g. genes encoding interleukin IL-6 and IL-15) related to cellular necrosis and pro-inflammatory responses in uterus, and 3) decreased expression of the genes encoding GATA binding protein 6, chordin, and insulin-like 3 (INSL3) that account for embryonic development in uterus. Immunohistochemistry revealed localization of bacterial antigens in trophoblasts lining the chorioallantoic membrane of ewes inoculated with the C. jejuni SA clone. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that C. jejuni SA clones are capable of causing abortion or stillbirth in experimentally infected sheep. Furthermore, down- or up-regulation of specific genes in the uterus of infected pregnant ewes might implicate host genes in facilitating the disease progression. Since the C. jejuni SA strains share genotypic similarities with clones that have been isolated from human clinical cases of gastroenteritis, these strains might represent a potential public health risk.

Many of these adverse events can be avoided by proper identification and understanding the underlying physiology, preparation, and post intubation management. Those with high risk features including severe metabolic acidosis; shock and hypotension; obstructive lung disease; pulmonary hypertension, right ventricle failure, and pulmonary embolism; and severe hypoxemia must be managed with airway expertise. Conclusions This narrative review discusses the pearls and pitfalls of commonly encountered physiologic high-risk intubations with a focus on the emergency clinician.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lentz, Skyler; Grossman, Alexandra; Koyfman, Alex; Long, Brit","journal":"J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27faec4085a3862934f98c2e8d2c765e6efe6a6b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467920304066; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467920304066?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergent airway management","patient management","airway expertise","emergency department","post intubation management","Abstract Background Successful airway management","emergency physicians","emergency clinician","practice of emergency medicine","endotracheal intubation","narrative review","Discussion Adverse events","physiologic high-risk intubations","pulmonary hypertension","pulmonary embolism","severe hypoxemia","post-intubation cardiac arrest","wide range of physiologic challenges","pitfall discussion","severe metabolic acidosis","shock","hypotension","obstructive lung disease","right ventricle failure","evidence-based approach","pitfalls","challenging cases","underlying physiology","high risk features","ill patients","pearls","preparation","focus","proper identification","Conclusions","Objective","two-part series"],"language":"en"},

However, understanding of the role of respiratory tract microbiota in the clinical course of pediatric CAP is limited. METHODS: We sought to compare microbiota profiles in induced sputum and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) samples from children and to identify microbiota profiles associated with CAP severity. We used 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and several measures of microbiota profiles, including principal component analysis (PCA), to describe the respiratory microbiota in 383 children, 6 months to \u003C18 years, hospitalized with CAP. We examined associations between induced sputum and NP/OP microbiota profiles and CAP severity (hospital length of stay and intensive care unit admission) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Relative abundance of bacterial taxa differed in induced sputum and NP/OP samples. In children 6 months to \u003C 5 years, the sputum PCA factor with high relative abundance of Actinomyces, Veillonella, Rothia, and Lactobacillales was associated with decreased odds of length of stay \u2265 4 days [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.69; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.48\u20130.99]. The sputum factor with high relative abundance of Haemophilus and Pasteurellaceae was associated with increased odds of intensive care unit admission [aOR 1.52; 95 % CI 1.02\u20132.26]. In children 5 to \u003C 18 years, the sputum factor with high relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteriodales, Lactobacillales, and Prevotella was associated with increased odds of length of stay \u2265 4 days [aOR 1.52; 95 % CI 1.02\u20132.26]. Taxa in NP/OP samples were not associated with CAP severity. CONCLUSION: Certain taxa in the respiratory microbiota, which were detected in induced sputum samples, are associated with the clinical course of CAP.

Despite the knowledge of these viruses since the 1970\u2019s, vaccination strategies have not been implemented, leading to continuous re-emergence of novel virulent strains. Live attenuated vaccines historically have been the most efficient. We consider that the new trend is the development of recombinant vaccines by using reverse genetics systems to engineer attenuated viruses, which could be used as effective and safe modified live vaccine candidates. To this end, host cell signaling pathways influencing porcine CoV virulence should be identified. Similarly, the identity of viral proteins involved in the modulation of host cell pathways influencing CoV pathogenesis should be analyzed. With this information, and using reverse genetics systems, it is possible to design viruses with modifications in the viral proteins acting as virulence factors, which may lead to attenuated viruses and, therefore, vaccine candidates. In addition, novel antiviral drugs may be developed once the host cell pathways and the molecular mechanism affecting porcine CoV replication and virulence are known. This review is focused in the host cell responses to enteric porcine CoV infection and the viral proteins involved in pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zu\u00F1iga, Sonia; Pascual-Iglesias, Alejandro; Sanchez, Carlos M.; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbad827abaeba849f4e52dba8a07c0d60596833c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ee306e100fdffb087cfbf544c3131e7054f5e9f1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6c1549e58428428b5ef8b321f3ad12040d8aff86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5159199.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216303999; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216303999; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27397100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine CoV virulence","attenuated viruses","porcine CoV replication","enteric porcine CoV infection","porcine herds","host cell responses","modulation of host cell pathways","CoV pathogenesis","Porcine enteric coronaviruses","identity of viral proteins","Live attenuated vaccines","reverse genetics systems","virulence factors","safe modified live vaccine candidates","development of recombinant vaccines","novel antiviral drugs","continuous re-emergence of novel virulent strains","molecular mechanism","cause severe disease","CoVs","modifications","new trend","important economic losses","addition","information","vaccination strategies","review","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Structural information relating to p7 from multiple genotypes has been generated in silico (e.g. genotype (GT) 1a), as well as obtained from experiments in form of monomeric and hexameric structures (GTs 1b and 5a, respectively). However, sequence diversity and structural differences mean that comparison of their channel gating behaviour has not thus far been simulated. Here, a molecular model of the monomeric GT 1a protein is optimized and assembled into a hexameric bundle for comparison with both the 5a hexamer structure and another hexameric bundle generated using the GT 1b monomer structure. All bundles tend to turn into a compact structure during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Gromos96 (ffG45a3)) in hydrated lipid bilayers, as well as when simulated at \u2018low pH\u2019, which may trigger channel opening according to some functional studies. Both GT 1a and 1b channel models are gated via movement of the parallel aligned helices, yet the scenario for the GT 5a protein is more complex, with a short N-terminal helix being involved. However, all bundles display pulsatile dynamics identified by monitoring water dynamics within the pore.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalita, Monoj Mon; Griffin, Stephen; Chou, James J.; Fischer, Wolfgang B.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/409f62f3470031ca8d2209e2e537cd4fcc75dd34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094707.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0005273615000772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772504/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273615000772; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.03.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monomeric GT","molecular dynamics","hexameric bundle","b channel models","b monomer structure","p7","pulsatile dynamics","comparison","hexameric structures","compact structure","hexamer structure","bundles","monitoring water dynamics","channel gating behaviour","form of monomeric","structural differences","Structural information","molecular model","amino acid polytopic membrane protein","MD","ffG45a3","movement","membranes","Gromos96","simulations","scenario","modulation of electrochemical gradients","multiple genotypes","hepatitis C virus","HCV","infected cells","parallel aligned helices","silico","GTs","short N-terminal helix","sequence diversity","hydrated lipid bilayers","pore","experiments","functional studies","low pH"],"language":"en"},

First, MERS-CoV productively infected Mo-DCs while SARS-CoV-infection was abortive. Second, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03B3, IP-10, IL-12, and RANTES expression than SARS-CoV. Third, MERS-CoV-infection induced higher surface expression of MHC class II (HLA-DR) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 than SARS-CoV-infection. Overall, our data suggests that the dendritic cell can serve as an important target of viral replication and a vehicle for dissemination.

Among enteropathogens, Cryptosporidium spp. are primary causes of diarrhea, but outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis are rarely reported in cattle. From January to April in 2016, severe diarrhea was observed in over 400 neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in Jiangsu Province of East China. Approximately 360 calves died due to watery diarrhea despite antibiotic therapy. In this study, 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak, and analysed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). In a post-outbreak investigation, 418 and 1372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analysed for rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. by EIA and PCR, respectively, to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm. Cryptosporidium spp. were genotyped using established techniques. Initial EIA tests showed that 15/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum, while 8/18 were positive for rotavirus. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7%, with odds of the Cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4\u201323.5 times higher than after the outbreak. Four Cryptosporidium spp. were identified after the outbreak including C. parvum (n = 79), Cryptosporidium ryanae (n = 48), Cryptosporidium bovis (n = 31), and Cryptosporidium andersoni (n = 3), with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals. Infection with C. parvum (73/79) was found in the majority of calves aged \u22643 weeks, consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA19G1. In the post-outbreak investigation, C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre- and post-weaned calves, while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea. Results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that C. bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves. Thus, we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves. More attention should be directed toward preventing the dissemination of this virulent subtype in China.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Na; Wang, Rui; Cai, Min; Jiang, Wen; Feng, Yaoyu; Xiao, Lihua","journal":"International Journal for Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74f7da0a3a9691e7f5b8c7dbbb3e67bf90089ef2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089608.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751919300840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071320/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.02.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020751919300840","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EIA"],"locations":["East China","China"],"keyphrases":["diarrhea outbreak","Cryptosporidium infection","Cryptosporidium parvum","occurrence of diarrhea","moderate diarrhea","parvum infection","majority of calves","Cryptosporidium ryanae","Cryptosporidium bovis","major outbreak of severe diarrhea","pre-weaned calves","post-weaned calves","neonatal dairy calves","Cryptosporidium andersoni","age of ill calves","occurrence of watery diarrhea","rotavirus infection","overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium","Abstract Neonatal diarrhea","post-outbreak investigation","ryanae infection","bovis infection","primary causes of diarrhea","parvum IIdA19G1","parvum isolates","large dairy farm","dairy cattle","subtype IIdA19G1","Initial EIA tests","animals of various age groups","fecal specimens","virulent subtype","Jiangsu Province of East China","risk factor","association","weeks","co-infections of multiple species","Results of logistic regression analysis","important syndromes","enzymatic immunoassay","dissemination","report","antibiotic therapy","times higher","odds","study","established techniques","cryptosporidiosis","PCR","roles","attention"],"language":"en"},

The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. METHODS: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity.

No human studies have been undertaken to date. We assessed the feasibility, safety and potential anticoagulant effects of administration of nebulised heparin to patients with ALI. METHODS: An open label phase 1 trial of four escalating doses of nebulised heparin was performed. A total of 16 ventilated patients with ALI were studied. The first group was administered a total of 50,000 U/day, the second group 100,000 U/day, the third group 200,000 U/day and the fourth group 400,000 U/day. Assessments of lung function included the PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio, lung compliance and the alveolar dead space fraction. Monitoring of anticoagulation included the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and the thrombin clotting time. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected and the prothrombin fragment and tissue plasminogen activator levels were assessed. Analysis of variance was used to compare the effects of dose. RESULTS: No serious adverse events occurred for any dose. The changes over time for the PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio, lung compliance and the alveolar dead space fraction levels were similar for all doses. A trend to increased APTT and thrombin clotting time levels was present with higher doses (P = 0.09 and P = 0.1, respectively). For the highest dose, the APTT reached 64 seconds; following cessation of nebulised heparin, the APTT fell to 39 seconds (P = 0.06). In bronchoalveolar lavage samples a trend to reduced prothrombin fragment levels was present with higher doses (P = 0.1), while tissue plasminogen activator levels were similar for all doses. CONCLUSION: Administration of nebulised heparin to mechanically ventilated patients with ALI is feasible. Nebulised heparin was not associated with any serious adverse events, and at higher doses it increased APTT levels. Larger trials are required to further investigate the safety and efficacy of nebulised heparin. In these trials due consideration must be given to systemic anticoagulant effects.

The emergence of novel PEDV strains in recent years has decreased the effectiveness of PEDV vaccines. We have developed a live recombinant vaccine, a swinepox virus vector that expresses a truncated S protein (rSPV-St) from a recent PEDV strain, SQ2014, and evaluated its immunogenicity and effectiveness in a swine model. Vaccination of swine with rSPV-St elicited a robust antibody response specific for the homologous PEDV SQ2014. Serum IgA titers in rSPV-St-vaccinated animals were significantly higher than in those immunized with inactivated vaccines. The effectiveness of antibodies induced by the rSPV-St vaccine in protection against PEDV was tested in a passive-transfer model in which piglets were challenged with the homologous virus SQ2014 and the heterologous strain CV777. When challenged with the homologous virus, sera from rSPV-St vaccination provided complete protection. However, sera from rSPV-St vaccination did not provide any protection against the heterologous virus challenge. Amino acid sequence differences in the S proteins of the two viruses were identified within neutralizing epitopes, which might have contributed to the divergent clinical results.

Litopenaeus vannamei (also known as Pacific white shrimp) is affected by this disease that leads to a range of clinical symptoms including hepatopancreas atrophy and necrosis, soft shell, slow growth, and abdominal muscle whitening and necrosis in the acute stage of disease. A new nodavirus, termed covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV), has been shown to be the etiological agent. In this study, we report a sensitive and specific real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the rapid and quantitative detection of CMNV. The optimal conditions for this newly developed RT-LAMP reaction were found to be 6mM MgCl2 and 1.6mM dNTPs, an incubation temperature of 65\u00B0C and a reaction time of 50min. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was estimated to be 6.3pg total RNA of CMNV-infected shrimp and 27 copies of the target plasmid. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed assay versus the standard nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay was 96.4% and 94.4%, respectively. The reaction products were detected by visual inspection after staining with an in-tube DNA fluorescent dye, a measure taken to eliminate the risk of contamination. The quantitative RT-LAMP assay for CMNV showed high correlation coefficient (r 2 =0.9953) when the initial templates were above 1000 copies, however the correlation coefficient decreased when the initial templates were lower than 1000 copies. Test of viral load in shrimp indicated that the viral loads varied from 1.5\u00D7102 to 6.7\u00D7106 copies per mg of cephalothorax tissue. Thus, the CMNV RT-LAMP assay is a sensitive and specific new tool for the field detection and quantification of CMNV in the diagnosis and surveillance of covert mortality disease.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qingli; Liu, Shuang; Yang, Haolin; Zhu, Luoluo; Wan, Xiaoyuan; Li, Xiaoping; Huang, Jie","journal":"Journal of Invertebrate Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14216854a073303d5e08cf7182dfb8881a01b2b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127608.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363123/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022201115300112; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201115300112; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2015.09.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Litopenaeus"],"organizations":["CMNV"],"locations":["China","Southeast Asia","Pacific"],"keyphrases":["CMNV RT-LAMP assay","quantitative RT-LAMP assay","developed assay","RT-PCR","developed RT-LAMP reaction","copies","quantification of CMNV","quantitative detection of CMNV","surveillance of covert mortality disease","covert mortality nodavirus","infected shrimp","acute stage of disease","pg total RNA of CMNV","necrosis","shrimp farming industry","new nodavirus","Pacific white shrimp","initial templates","reaction products","reaction time","specific new tool","high correlation coefficient","specific real-time reverse transcription loop","standard nested reverse transcription PCR","field detection","analytical sensitivity","diagnostic sensitivity","viral loads","Test of viral load","China","hepatopancreas atrophy","slow growth","isothermal amplification","soft shell","abdominal muscle whitening","increasing problem","recent years","diagnosis","measure","countries of Southeast Asia","range of clinical symptoms","tube DNA fluorescent dye","serious losses","staining","visual inspection","specificity","dNTPs","incubation temperature","optimal conditions","Litopenaeus vannamei","target plasmid","production","cephalothorax tissue","risk of contamination","etiological agent","MgCl2","study"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we conducted detailed analysis on the immunogenicity of D8, a previously reported protective antigen from intracellular mature virions.

These diseases cause large numbers of deaths each year due to airway obstruction, which is exacerbated by respiratory viral infection. The inflammatory response in the airway is mediated in part through the MAPK pathways: p38, JNK and ERK. These pathways also have roles in interferon production, viral replication, mucus production, and T cell responses, all of which are important processes in inflammatory airway disease. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are known to regulate the MAPKs, and roles for this family of proteins in the pathogenesis of airway disease are emerging. This review summarizes the function of DUSPs in regulation of cytokine expression, mucin production, and viral replication in the airway. The central role of DUSPs in T cell responses, including T cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation, will also be highlighted. In addition, the importance of this protein family in the lung, and the necessity of further investigation into their roles in airway disease, will be discussed.","publish_time":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manley, Grace C.

An R package for visualisation, analysis and simulation of the outbreak data was developed to accompany the practical to reinforce learning outcomes.

Many pathogens have developed mechanisms to escape from host defense response using the host membrane microdomain machinery. Lipid rafts play an important role in a variety of cellular functions and the benefit provided by interaction with lipid rafts can vary from one pathogen to another. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the involvement of membrane microdomains during infection of human endothelial cell by S. agalactiae. METHODS: The effects of cholesterol depletion and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation during S. agalactiae-human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) interaction were analysed by pre-treatment with methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD) or LY294002 inhibitors, immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. The involvement of lipid rafts was analysed by colocalisation of bacteria with flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 using fluorescence confocal microscopy. FINDINGS: In this work, we demonstrated the importance of the integrity of lipid rafts microdomains and activation of PI3K/Akt pathway during invasion of S. agalactiae strain to HUVEC cells. Our results suggest the involvement of flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 during the invasion of S. agalactiae strain in HUVEC cells. CONCLUSIONS: The collection of our results suggests that lipid microdomain affects the interaction of S. agalactiae type III belonging to the hypervirulent ST-17 with HUVEC cells through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferreira, Beatriz Jandre; Lannes-Costa, Pamella Silva; Santos, Gabriela da Silva; Mermelstein, Cl\u00E1udia; Einicker-Lamas, Marcelo; Nagao, Prescilla Emy","journal":"Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/796664228da20a93c66ea8c1956207c7704dca06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7066991.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32187326/; https://doi.org/10.1590/0074-02760190398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","III"],"organizations":["PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["agalactiae type","agalactiae strain","HUVEC cells","involvement of lipid rafts","lipid microdomain","Akt pathway","interaction","integrity of lipid rafts microdomains","agalactiae-human umbilical vein endothelial cells","activation of PI3K","pathway activation","Streptococcus agalactiae capsular type","involvement of flotillin","involvement of membrane microdomains","invasion","caveolin","results","host membrane microdomain machinery","infection of human endothelial cell","host defense response","strains","M\u03B2CD","cyclodextrin","benefit","important role","leading cause of invasive neonatal infections","LY294002 inhibitors","variety of cellular functions","effects of cholesterol depletion","pre-treatment","methyl-\u03B2","hypervirulent ST","immunofluorescence","mechanisms","BACKGROUND","importance","colocalisation of bacteria","analysis","METHODS","fluorescence confocal microscopy","collection","work","CONCLUSIONS","study","FINDINGS","OBJECTIVES","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Since the keynote presentation focused on the oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L pathway the main area of focus was on host\u2013virus interactions, however other areas of interest included virus vectors, current models of virus infections, prevention and treatment of virus infections, separate sessions on RNA viruses and prion proteins, and a special talk highlighting various attributes of targeted next-generation sequencing. The meeting was held at the peak of the fall Aspen colors surrounded by five mountains \u003E11000 ft (3.3 km) where the secluded campus provided the ideal setting for extended discussions and outdoor exercise.

Objective: Describe ME/CFS onset and course in one United States-based cohort. Methods: One hundred and fifty subjects fitting Fukuda 1994 CFS criteria completed a detailed survey concerning the initial and subsequent stages of their illness. Descriptive statistics, graphs, and tables were used to illustrate prevalence and patterns of characteristics. Results: The most common peri-onset events reported by subjects were infection-related episodes (64%), stressful incidents (39%), and exposure to environmental toxins (20%). For 38% of subjects, more than 6 months elapsed from experiencing any initial symptom to developing the set of symptoms comprising their ME/CFS. Over time, the 12 most common symptoms persisted but declined in prevalence, with fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, exertion-related sickness, and flu-like symptoms declining the most (by 20\u201325%). Conversely, cognitive symptoms changed the least in prevalence, rising in symptom ranking. Pregnancy, menopause, and menstrual cycles exacerbated many women\u0027s symptoms. Fatigue-related function was not associated with duration of illness or age; during the worst periods of their illness, 48% of subjects could not engage in any productive activity. At the time of survey, 47% were unable to work and only 4% felt their condition was improving steadily with the majority (59%) describing a fluctuating course. Ninety-seven percent suffered from at least one other illness: anxiety (48%), depression (43%), fibromyalgia (39%), irritable bowel syndrome (38%), and migraine headaches (37%) were the most diagnosed conditions. Thirteen percent came from families where at least one other first-degree relative was also afflicted, rising to 27% when chronic fatigue of unclear etiology was included. Conclusions: This paper offers a broad epidemiologic overview of one ME/CFS cohort in the United States. While most of our findings are consistent with prior studies, we highlight underexamined aspects of this condition (e.g., the evolution of symptoms) and propose new interpretations of findings. Studying these aspects can offer insight and solutions to the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition.","publish_time":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Lily; Valencia, Ian J.; Garvert, Donn W.; Montoya, Jose G.","journal":"Front Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a28705c31de943b7e9904c40a0b1f4f1ba7ca52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6370741.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["subjects","common symptoms","CFS onset","CFS cohort","women\u0027s symptoms","evolution of symptoms","set of symptoms","cognitive symptoms","CFS criteria","prevalence","chronic fatigue syndrome","Fatigue-related function","duration of illness","chronic fatigue of unclear etiology","initial symptom","underexamined aspects","different aspects","time of survey","percent","United States-based cohort","exertion-related sickness","infection-related episodes","Epidemiologic studies of myalgic encephalomyelitis","prior studies","detailed survey","common peri-onset events","symptom ranking","fluctuating course","broad epidemiologic overview","irritable bowel syndrome","new interpretations of findings","unrefreshing sleep","menstrual cycles","subsequent stages","diagnosis","paper","tables","Background","pathophysiology","solutions","Fukuda","worst periods","Descriptive statistics","graphs","Pregnancy","menopause","families","insight","treatment","months","exposure","environmental toxins","depression","fibromyalgia","Conclusions","Results","patterns of characteristics","disease","anxiety","Objective","stressful incidents","productive activity","migraine headaches","diagnosed conditions","majority","Methods"],"language":"en"},

However, no approved prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are currently available. The MERS-CoV envelope spike protein serves as a crucial target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development, as it plays a critical role in mediating viral entry through interactions with the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Here, we constructed a recombinant rare serotype of the chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdC68) that expresses full-length MERS-CoV S protein (AdC68-S). Single intranasal immunization with AdC68-S induced robust and sustained neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in BALB/c mice. In a human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mouse model, it completely protected against lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-MA). Passive transfer of immune sera to na\u00EFve hDPP4-KI mice also provided survival advantages from lethal MERS-CoV-MA challenge. Analysis of sera absorption and isolated monoclonal antibodies from immunized mice demonstrated that the potent and broad neutralizing activity was largely attributed to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results show that AdC68-S can induce protective immune responses in mice and represent a promising candidate for further development against MERS-CoV infection in both dromedaries and humans.","publish_time":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Wenxu; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Zhang, Chao; Li, Mingxi; Zhou, Haixia; Zhang, Shuyuan; Zhou, Panpan; Xu, Jiuyang; Shan, Sisi; Shi, Xuanling; Wang, Xinquan; Zhao, Jincun; Zhou, Dongming; Perlman, Stanley; Zhang, Linqi","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89c52fc69362dbc2c29ed79aa72928ad14dc4c80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6542157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130102/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2019.1620083","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["lethal MERS-CoV","MERS-CoV infection","full-length MERS-CoV S protein","mouse-adapted MERS-CoV","MERS-CoV envelope spike protein","neutralizing antibodies","AdC68-S induced robust","immunized mice","c mice","na\u00EFve hDPP4-KI mice","lethal challenge","MA challenge","humans","sustained neutralizing antibody","isolated monoclonal antibodies","protective immune responses","broad neutralizing activity","cellular receptor","Passive transfer of immune sera","vaccine development","mouse model","T cell responses","Analysis of sera absorption","receptor binding domain","human DPP4 knock","fatal acute respiratory illness","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","crucial target","survival advantages","interactions","BALB","viral entry","chimpanzee adenovirus","Single intranasal immunization","RBD","dipeptidyl peptidase","promising candidate","therapeutic interventions","recombinant rare serotype","critical role","dromedaries","approved prophylactic","results"],"language":"en"},

Clinical algorithms to identify children who are likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment remain suboptimal. Biomarkers that accurately identify serious bacterial infection (SBI) could improve diagnosis and clinical management. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) are neutrophil-derived biomarkers associated with bacterial infection. Methods We evaluated LCN2 and MMP-8 as candidate biomarkers in 40 healthy controls and 151 febrile children categorised confirmed SBI, probable SBI, or viral infection. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8 to predict SBI was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared to the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results Plasma LCN2 and MMP-8 concentration were predictive of SBI. The AUROC (95% CI) for LCN2, MMP8 and CRP to predict SBI was 0.88 (0.82-0.94); 0.80 (0.72-0.87) and 0.89 (0.84-0.94), respectively. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 in combination with CRP was significantly superior to either marker alone: AUROC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). Conclusion LCN2 is a sensitive and specific predictor of SBI in children which could be used to improve clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. LCN2 should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herberg, Jethro; Huang, Honglei; Thezenas, Marie L.; Janes, Victoria; Carter, Michael; Gormley, Stuart; Hamilton, Melisa S.; Kessler, Benedikt; Levin, Michael; Casals-Pascual, Climent","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb998c7f6a6e5e42d9ca05cec581544b92099782.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e7bdd52badd2d2ca8ce7bd838ca42d02ca3396ee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/623819","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SBI","Lipocalin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusion LCN2","diagnostic performance of LCN2","probable SBI","confirmed SBI","predictive of SBI","Results Plasma LCN2","specific predictor of SBI","CRP","AUROC","clinical management","Introduction Bacterial infection","serious bacterial infection","febrile children","viral infection","Clinical algorithms","candidate biomarkers","neutrophil-derived biomarkers","performance of C","prospective clinical studies","neutrophil collagenase","antimicrobial treatment","antimicrobial stewardship","healthy controls","leading cause of death","combination","concentration","receiver","characteristic curve","area","reactive protein","diagnosis","MMP8","Lipocalin","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Thus, non-plaque-forming particles are biologically active, and likely contribute to the immunogenicity of vaccinia virus vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00FClf, Anna-Theresa; Freudenstein, Astrid; Marr, Lisa; Sutter, Gerd; Volz, Asisa","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e712a493d5a37d00b7be577046b13d9dc793c62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741426/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216302586; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216302586","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["non-plaque","number of counted virus particles","viral gene expression","immunogenicity of vaccinia virus vaccines","level of viral early gene expression","cell culture infections","activation of late viral transcription","standard vaccine preparations of recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara","transcriptional control of specific viral early","Live cell imaging","permissive cell cultures","fluorescent microscopy","recombinant viruses","number of plaques","late promoters","fluorescent reporter proteins","single infected cells","automated counting","switch","virions","Abstract","biological activity","titration"],"language":"en"},

Objective To determine whether there is a relation between the serostatus of 13 different viruses and parentally reported infections and IgE sensitization in 2-year-old children. To investigate whether there is an interaction between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in relation to IgE sensitization. Methods A total of 246 infants were followed prospectively to 2 years of age with clinical examinations, skin prick test, and specific IgE analyses and through analysis of seropositivity against adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, and varicella-zoster virus. Results There was some evidence that IgE sensitization (24%) tended to be more common among children who were seropositive against few compared with children who were seropositive against many viruses, but this was not statistically significant, and there was no consistent trend across the groups. IgE sensitization was statistically significantly less prevalent at 2 years of age among infants who were seropositive against EBV but not other viruses (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.86). The interaction of seropositivity against both CMV and EBV antibodies indicated a further reduction in the risk for IgE sensitization (adjusted odds ratio for interaction, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.92), indicating effect modification associated with seropositivity against CMV. Conclusion Our results indicate that acquisition of EBV infection during the first 2 years of life is associated with a reduced risk of IgE sensitization, and this effect is enhanced by CMV coinfection.","publish_time":"2005-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nilsson, Caroline; Linde, Annika; Montgomery, Scott M.; Gustafsson, Liselotte; N\u00E4sman, Per; Blomberg, Marita Troye; Lilja, Gunnar","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0cfe37e539ff3d2534d098467d91a1d995f83d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119037.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674905007700; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674905007700","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":["EBV","CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reduced risk of IgE sensitization","specific IgE analyses","decreased prevalence of IgE","EBV antibodies","CMV coinfection","interaction of seropositivity","years of age","acquisition of EBV infection","respiratory syncytial virus","herpes simplex virus","Epstein-Barr virus","analysis of seropositivity","varicella-zoster virus","adjusted odds ratio","different viruses","infants","relation","years of life","Results","year-old children","indirect evidence","effect modification","skin prick test","parainfluenza","clinical examinations","human herpesvirus","increased infectious burden","adenovirus","mediated allergy","reduction","infections","serostatus","childhood","cytomegalovirus","consistent trend","groups","total","Methods","Conclusion","Background","Objective"],"language":"en"},

We used a broad range PCR approach to investigate the presence and diversity of astroviruses in healthy pigs of different ages on 20 farms and in 3 slaughterhouses situated in the province of Quebec, Canada between 2005 and 2007. Our study unexpectedly revealed remarkable levels of genetic diversity and high prevalence of astroviruses in pigs of this province. Astroviruses were detected on every farm investigated and in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to adults. In addition, we found that nearly 80% of healthy finisher pigs harbour astroviruses in their intestine at slaughter. Phylogenetic evidence based on partial polymerase and complete capsid sequences, suggests that porcine astroviruses do not form a monophyletic group but are rather found on separate branches across the mamastrovirus tree. In addition to type species strains, we found highly divergent strains that form two additional lineages, one of which falls outside existing taxonomic groups. The presence of diverse astroviruses in a majority of healthy pigs likely represents a continuous source of infection to piglets and possibly to other animal species including humans. Porcine astrovirus strains appeared phylogenetically related not only to prototypical human astroviruses, as was already known, but also to novel human strains recently discovered suggesting multiple cross species transmission events between these hosts and other animal species. Overall, the findings reported in this study suggest an active role of pigs in the evolution and ecology of the Astroviridae.","publish_time":"2011-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Zhiyao; Roi, St\u00E9phanie; Dastor, Margaux; Gallice, Estelle; Laurin, Marc-Andr\u00E9; L\u2019Homme, Yvan","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2ac513c77cc86808fdcf4ddbfe9be0fd1344690.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172684.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113510005663; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.11.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113510005663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21159453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Quebec","Canada"],"keyphrases":["diversity of astroviruses","porcine astroviruses","healthy finisher pigs harbour astroviruses","majority of healthy pigs","presence of diverse astroviruses","prototypical human astroviruses","high prevalence of astroviruses","age groups of pigs","Porcine astrovirus strains","type species strains","animal species","healthy pigs of different ages","active role of pigs","divergent strains","novel human strains","Knowledge of porcine astrovirus diversity","study","multiple cross species transmission events","remarkable levels of genetic diversity","suckling piglets","province of Quebec","existing taxonomic groups","partial polymerase","complete capsid sequences","hosts","evolution","epidemiology","intestine","continuous source of infection","broad range PCR approach","farms","separate branches","Phylogenetic evidence","mamastrovirus tree","slaughterhouses","additional lineages","ecology","monophyletic group","adults","Astroviridae","Canada","humans","findings"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (\u223C70%) is more prevalent than the S type (\u223C30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Xiaolu; Wu, Changcheng; Li, Xiang; Song, Yuhe; Yao, Xinmin; Wu, Xinkai; Duan, Yuange; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Yirong; Qian, Zhaohui; Cui, Jie; Lu, Jian","journal":"Natl Sci Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32758c2c2d6d9a18702e6198c3aedd80e2788d78.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","S type","bat SARS-related coronavirus","genomic data","Wuhan","severe selective pressure","weaker selective pressure","epidemiological data","coronavirus disease","functional sites","genomic nucleotides","major types","neutral sites","relative frequency","early stages","related coronaviruses","pangolin SARSr-CoVs","major global concern","large portion of China","extent of molecular divergence","clinical symptoms of patients","chart records","comprehensive studies","receptor-binding domain","complete linkage","development of new variations","RaTG13","urgent need","viral strains","RBD","outbreak","difference","spike","Population genetic analyses","different SNPs","COVID","variability","epidemic","genomes","Human intervention","mutations","date","findings","results","hand","ancestral version","recombination"],"language":"en"},

The final products of those activities usually comprise internal memoranda and briefs within public health authorities and original research published in peer-reviewed journals. Using the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic as an example, we conducted a comprehensive time-stratified review of the published literature to describe the different types of epidemiological outputs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified and analyzed all published articles on the epidemiology of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong or Toronto. The analysis was stratified by study design, research domain, data collection, and analytical technique. We compared the SARS-case and matched-control non-SARS articles published according to the timeline of submission, acceptance, and publication. The impact factors of the publishing journals were examined according to the time of publication of SARS articles, and the numbers of citations received by SARS-case and matched-control articles submitted during and after the epidemic were compared. Descriptive, analytical, theoretical, and experimental epidemiology concerned, respectively, 54%, 30%, 11%, and 6% of the studies. Only 22% of the studies were submitted, 8% accepted, and 7% published during the epidemic. The submission-to-acceptance and acceptance-to-publication intervals of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic period were significantly shorter than the corresponding intervals of matched-control non-SARS articles published in the same journal issues (p\u003C0.001 and p\u003C0.01, respectively). The differences of median submission-to-acceptance intervals and median acceptance-to-publication intervals between SARS articles and their corresponding control articles were 106.5 d (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.0\u2013140.1) and 63.5 d (95% CI 18.0\u201394.1), respectively. The median numbers of citations of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic and over the 2 y thereafter were 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 8.0\u201352.0) and 8 (IQR 3.2\u201321.8), respectively, significantly higher than the median numbers of control article citations (15, IQR 8.5\u201316.5, p\u003C0.05, and 7, IQR 3.0\u201312.0, p\u003C0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the epidemiological articles on SARS were submitted after the epidemic had ended, although the corresponding studies had relevance to public health authorities during the epidemic. To minimize the lag between research and the exigency of public health practice in the future, researchers should consider adopting common, predefined protocols and ready-to-use instruments to improve timeliness, and thus, relevance, in addition to standardizing comparability across studies. To facilitate information dissemination, journal managers should reengineer their fast-track channels, which should be adapted to the purpose of an emerging outbreak, taking into account the requirement of high standards of quality for scientific journals and competition with other online resources.

Methods: Ten SPF cats were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. FIPV KU-2 were inoculated intraperitoneally to cats. The control group was administered PBS, and the U18666A-treated group was administered U18666A subcutaneously at 2.5 mg/kg on day 0, and 1.25 mg/kg on days 2 and 4 after viral inoculation. Results: Two of the five control cats administered PBS alone developed FIP. Four of the five cats administered U18666A developed no signs of FIP. One cat that temporarily developed fever, had no other clinical symptoms, and no gross lesion was noted on an autopsy after the end of the experiment. The FIPV gene was detected intermittently in feces and saliva regardless of the development of FIP or administration of U18666A. Conclusions: When U18666A was administered to cats experimentally infected with type I FIPV, the development of FIP might be suppressed compared with the control group.

Here, the clinical and microbiologic anti-Cryptosporidium efficacy of the piperazine-based compound MMV665917 was demonstrated in neonatal calves. Oral administration of MMV665917 (22 mg/kg once daily) was begun two days after the onset of severe diarrhea and continued for seven days.

MMV665917 was useful for treatment, rather than just prophylaxis, since it was safe and effective when administered well after the onset of diarrhea. Furthermore, even though all animals received intensive supportive care, there was a strong trend towards improved secondary health outcomes, including general health, appetite, and dehydration measures amongst treated animals.

Most clinical development of adenovirus vectors now uses simian adenoviruses or rare human serotypes, whereas reported manufacturing processes mainly use serotypes such as AdHu5 which are of questionable relevance for clinical vaccine development. Many clinically relevant vaccine transgenes interfere with adenovirus replication, whereas most reported process development uses selected antigens or even model transgenes such as fluorescent proteins which cause little such interference. Processes are typically developed for a single adenovirus serotype \u2013 transgene combination, requiring extensive further optimization for each new vaccine. There is a need for rapid production platforms for small GMP batches of non-replicating adenovirus vectors for early-phase vaccine trials, particularly in preparation for response to emerging pathogen outbreaks. Such platforms must be robust to variation in the transgene, and ideally also capable of producing adenoviruses of more than one serotype. It is also highly desirable for such processes to be readily implemented in new facilities using commercially available single-use materials, avoiding the need for development of bespoke tools or cleaning validation, and for them to be readily scalable for later-stage studies. Here we report the development of such a process, using single-use stirred-tank bioreactors, a transgene-repressing HEK293 cell \u2013 promoter combination, and fully single-use filtration and ion exchange components. We demonstrate applicability of the process to candidate vaccines against rabies, malaria and Rift Valley fever, each based on a different adenovirus serotype. We compare performance of a range of commercially available ion exchange media, including what we believe to be the first published use of a novel media for adenovirus purification (NatriFlo\u00AE HD-Q, Merck). We demonstrate the need for minimal process individualization for each vaccine, and that the product fulfils regulatory quality expectations. Cell-specific yields are at the upper end of those previously reported in the literature, and volumetric yields are in the range 1 \u00D7 10(13) \u2013 5 \u00D7 10(13) purified virus particles per litre of culture, such that a 2\u20134 L process is comfortably adequate to produce vaccine for early-phase trials. The process is readily transferable to any GMP facility with the capability for mammalian cell culture and aseptic filling of sterile products.","publish_time":"2019-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fedosyuk, Sofiya; Merritt, Thomas; Peralta-Alvarez, Marco Polo; Morris, Susan J; Lam, Ada; Laroudie, Nicolas; Kangokar, Anilkumar; Wright, Daniel; Warimwe, George M; Angell-Manning, Phillip; Ritchie, Adam J; Gilbert, Sarah C; Xenopoulos, Alex; Boumlic, Anissa; Douglas, Alexander D","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e724e9c56dedc9430663c4eb447b1b0ec08133e6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9461c2fa9c2d30b0438e6922e1c3a31e7dd34d24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6949866.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19305328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31047679/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19305328; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Good Manufacturing Practice","Rift Valley","Merck"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reported process development","single adenovirus serotype","single-use","clinical vaccine development","clinical development of adenovirus vectors","adenovirus replication","adenovirus purification","new vaccine","different adenovirus serotype","phase vaccine trials","reported manufacturing processes","production of non-replicating adenovirus vectors","available single","relevant vaccine transgenes","need","published use","small GMP batches of non-replicating adenovirus vectors","minimal process individualization","transgene combination","compliant processes","development of bespoke tools","GMP facility","transgene-repressing HEK293 cell","mammalian cell culture","available ion exchange media","Cell-specific yields","phase trials","range","rapid production platforms","ion exchange components","promoter combination","novel media","model transgenes","simian adenoviruses","litre of culture","volumetric yields","new facilities","rare human serotypes","variety of Good Manufacturing Practice","rabies","NatriFlo","preparation","malaria","capability","selected antigens","aseptic filling of sterile products","candidate vaccines","tank bioreactors","response","questionable relevance","optimization","Rift Valley fever","HD-Q","important challenges","emerging pathogen outbreaks","fluorescent proteins","cleaning validation","AdHu5","filtration","materials","regulatory quality expectations","Merck","virus particles","upper end","applicability","variation","stage studies","interference","literature","performance"],"language":"en"},

The disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the COVID-19.

Three known antigenic proteins (Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and Membrane protein, hereafter called NOM) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic B and T-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools. Based on in silico analysis, we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate (NOM) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored T and B-cell epitopes. After predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate, the best 3 D predicted model was applied for docking studies with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and HLA-A*11:01. In the next step, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with TLR4 and HLA-A*11:01 receptors. MD studies demonstrated that the NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A*11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time.

A cold, which can at first appear benign, must not be disregarded during a consultation at the community pharmacy as it can be incapacitating for the patient. Rhinitis of a viral origin is said to be acute, but it can also be the result of an allergy or caused by irritating agents. The first advice to give concerns hygiene. Anodynes can be recommended to relieve fever, as well as antihistamines or decongestants taken orally, and a local treatment to unblock the airways. Treatments taken internally help to treat all the symptoms. Finally, some aromatherapy and homeopathic remedies can be recommended.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berth\u00E9l\u00E9my, St\u00E9phane","journal":"Actualit\u00E9s Pharmaceutiques","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0515370013000888; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0515370013000888","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["b\u00E9nin"],"keyphrases":["the patient","the symptoms","but it can also be the result","Anodynes can be recommended to relieve fever","homeopathic remedies can be recommended","consultation at the community pharmacy as it can be incapacitating","be disregarded during","local treatment to unblock the airways","The first advice to give concerns hygiene","viral origin is said to be acute","as well as antihistamines","which can at first appear benign","Treatments taken internally help to treat","traitement local","voie orale","irritating agents","voie g\u00E9n\u00E9rale","origine virale","agents irritants","origine allergique","decongestants taken orally","must","an allergy","some aromatherapy","caused","aromath\u00E9rapie","hom\u00E9opathie","Finally","Rhinitis","antihistaminiques","rhinite","sp\u00E9cialit\u00E9s utilis\u00E9es","d\u00E9congestionnants","voies respiratoires","premier abord","premiers conseils","ordre hygi\u00E9nique","visite","officine","fi\u00E8vre","ensemble des sympt\u00F4mes","traitements","rhume"],"language":"fr"},

Methods Patients with unexplained fever and thrombocytopenia were enrolled. Viruses were detected using real-time PCR, and bacteria were measured by culturing methods. Serum cytokines, platelet antibody IgG (PA-IgG) and Helicobacter pylori (HP) were detected using ELISA. Results Pathogens were detected in 74.68% of patients, which included single fungal/viral/bacterial infection and multiple infection. The pathogens could not be unidentified in 25.32% of cases. Cytokines including Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon-\u03B3(IFN-\u03B3), platelet activating factor (PAF) and PA-IgG were significantly higher in patients as compared to healthy controls (P \u003C .01 or P \u003C .05). Principal component analyses extracted four groups of parameters that have a strong positive predicting value, revealing that disease status evaluation would be more accurate if we combined the platelet parameters and inflammatory biomarkers. While event-free survival (EFS) that indicates the time of platelet elevated after therapy was the highest in patients with single bacterial or fungal infection, EFS was affected by the levels of cytokines and PA-IgG. Conclusions Differences in immune function may be the main factors affecting the prognosis of patients with fever and thrombocytopenia, while treatment based on precise etiological diagnosis is important for therapeutic efficacy.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Huanzhu; Lin, Chun; Fan, Zhiqiang; Yu, Wenjun; Cao, Manxiong; Ke, Changwen; Jiao, Xiaoyang","journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e81305e7f5f641662edb3ffea9fde1ee3a317a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124278.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898119300968; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2019.02.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30831067/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898119300968","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Methods Patients","PA-IgG","prognosis of patients","platelet antibody IgG","platelet parameters","thrombocytopenia","immunological features of patients","bacterial infection","fungal infection","time of platelet","multiple infection","EFS","unexplained fever","Serum cytokines","levels of cytokines","IL","groups of parameters","interferon-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B3","culturing methods","Results Pathogens","precise etiological diagnosis","strong positive predicting value","immune function","disease status evaluation","main factors","treatment","therapeutic efficacy","HP","Helicobacter pylori","healthy controls","therapy","PAF","Principal component analyses","real-time PCR","Conclusions Differences","event-free survival","inflammatory biomarkers","Abstract Purpose","Viruses","Interleukin","cases","ELISA"],"language":"en"},

The LAMP products had a ladder-like pattern of bands from 188bp when electrophoresed on an agarose gel and its specificity was confirmed by digestion with Hinc II enzyme. Two naked-eye detection methods were developed for use in the field. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was found to be 10fg DNA sample which was 100\u20131000-fold higher than that of PCR. By using DNA (or cDNA) samples extracted from three different PRV strains and six other viruses known to be related genetically to PRV or to cause similar clinical signals in pig, the system was identified to amplify only the PRV DNA.

METHODS We conducted a multi-site observational study from December 2009 to April 2010. Patients with influenza-like illness from 45 hospitals were enrolled. Patients received Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), conventional treatments, or CHM plus conventional treatments (combination treatment) according to the guidelines for influenza A/H1N1 2009 in China. The primary outcomes were the time to alleviation of symptoms and the incidence of complications. The secondary outcomes were the time until becoming afebrile, incidence of severe illness, testing negative on an influenza A viral test, and total medical fees. RESULTS In total, 5967 patients were enrolled. The percentages of patients prescribed CHM alone, conventional treatment, and combination treatment were 27.8%, 5.1%, and 67.7%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the time to alleviation of symptoms, incidence of complications, time to becoming afebrile, or rate of severe illness among the CHM, conventional, and combination treatment groups. The rates of testing negative on the influenza virus A rapid test and H1N1 virus test were 90.3% and 76.3%, respectively. However, significant differences were found in the total medical fees among the three groups: CHM treatments were more economical than the other two treatments.

The introduction of a new class of nanoscale materials with multiple unique properties and functions has sparked a series of breakthrough applications. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely reported to guide an impressive resurgence in biomedical and diagnostic applications. Here, we review the applications of AuNPs in virus testing and detection.

Chemoprevention has been the most effective strategy for lung cancer prevention. Thus, exploring novel and effective candidate agents with low toxicity for chemoprevention is essential and urgent. Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (H. cordata), which is a widely used herbal medicine and is also popularly consumed as a healthy vegetable, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumor activity. However, the chemopreventive effect of H. cordata against benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P)-initiated lung tumorigenesis and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. METHODS: A B[a]P-stimulated lung adenocarcinoma animal model in A/J mice in vivo and a normal lung cell model (BEAS.2B) in vitro were established to investigate the chemopreventive effects of H. cordata and its bioactive compound 2-undecanone against lung tumorigenesis and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: H. cordata and 2-undecanone significantly suppressed B[a]P-induced lung tumorigenesis without causing obvious systemic toxicity in mice in vivo. Moreover, H. cordata and 2-undecanone effectively decreased B[a]P-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and further notably protected BEAS.2B cells from B[a]P-induced DNA damage and inflammation by significantly inhibiting phosphorylated H2A.X overexpression and interleukin-1\u03B2 secretion. In addition, H. cordata and 2-undecanone markedly activated the Nrf2 pathway to induce the expression of the antioxidative enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1). Nrf2 silencing by transfection with Nrf2 siRNA markedly decreased the expression of HO-1 and NQO-1 to diminish the reductions in B[a]P-induced ROS overproduction, DNA damage and inflammation mediated by H. cordata and 2-undecanone. CONCLUSIONS: H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively activate the Nrf2-HO-1/NQO-1 signaling pathway to counteract intracellular ROS generation, thereby attenuating DNA damage and inflammation induced by B[a]P stimulation and playing a role in the chemoprevention of B[a]P-induced lung tumorigenesis. These findings provide new insight into the pharmacological action of H. cordata and indicate that H. cordata is a novel candidate agent for the chemoprevention of lung cancer.

Chemically competent BJ5183-AD-1 cells were transformed with the recombinant pShuttle-CMV to produce recombinant adenoviral plasmids. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the recombinant adenoviral plasmids to generate recombinant adenoviruses (hAd5/P1-2AB3BC(wt) and hAd5/P1-2AB3BC(m)). Expression of the target proteins was analyzed by sandwich ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay. The recombinant adenoviruses were purified and concentrated by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation. Growth kinetics and thermostability of the recombinant adenoviruses were compared with that of non-recombinant replication-defective adenovirus (dAd5). RESULTS: The recombinant adenoviruses containing capsid protein genes of the FMDV O/IND/R2/75 were generated and amplified in HEK-293 cells. The titer of the recombinant adenoviruses was approximately 10(8), 10(9.5) and 10(11) TCID(50)/ml in supernatant media, cell lysate and CsCl purified preparation, respectively. Expression of the FMDV capsid protein was detectable in sandwich ELISA and confirmed by immunofluorescence assay.

The recombinant gl had an apparent molecular weight of 116 kDa and was partially cleaved to yield 63-kDa (glb) and 52-kDa (glc) subunits. This processing step was significantly less efficient in insect cells than the analogous step in mammalian cells, even though the cleavage sites of authentic and recombinant gl were shown to be identical. The oligosaccharide linkages were mostly endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, in contrast to those of authentic gl, which has mostly endoglycosidase-H-resistant linkages and an apparent molecular weight of 130/74/55 kDa. Despite the reduced cleavage and altered glycosylation, the recombinant glycoprotein was transported and expressed on the surface of infected insect cells. These surface molecules were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Fusion was inhibited bythree monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic domains I and IV on gl. Domain I maps to the extracellular region of the carboxy terminal fragment glc and domain IV to the very amino terminus of the glb fragment, indicating that domains mapping in two distinct regions of gl function in cell fusion. Monoclonal antibodies specific for eight different epitopes recognized recombinant gl, indicating that the antigenic characteristics of the recombinant and authentic glycoproteins are similar.

Although influenza viral infections are usually diagnosed using viral isolation and serological/molecular analyses, the cost, accessibility, and availability of these methods may limit their utility in various settings. The objective of this study was to develop and optimized a multiplex detection system for most influenza viruses currently infecting humans. METHODS: We developed and optimized a multiplex detection system for most influenza viruses currently infecting humans including two type B (both Victoria lineages and Yamagata lineages), H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9 using Reverse Transcriptional Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) technology coupled with a one-pot colorimetric visualization system to facilitate direct determination of results without additional steps. We also evaluated this multiplex RT-LAMP for clinical use using a total of 135 clinical and spiked samples (91 influenza viruses and 44 other human infectious viruses). RESULTS: We achieved rapid detection of seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and Type B) and avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H5N6, H5N8 and H7N9) within an hour. The assay could detect influenza viruses with high sensitivity (i.e., from 100 to 0.1 viral genome copies), comparable to conventional RT-PCR-based approaches which would typically take several hours and require expensive equipment. This assay was capable of specifically detecting each influenza virus (Type B, H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8 and H7N9) without cross-reactivity with other subtypes of AIVs or other human infectious viruses. Furthermore, 91 clinical and spiked samples confirmed by qRT-PCR were also detected by this multiplex RT-LAMP with 98.9% agreement. It was more sensitive than one-step RT-PCR approach (92.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that our multiplex RT-LAMP assay may provide a rapid, sensitive, cost-effective, and reliable diagnostic method for identifying recent influenza viruses infecting humans, especially in locations without access to large platforms or sophisticated equipment.

It will be shown here that, alternatively, the epidemiology of the influenza lethality could be completely explained by a combination of two determinants: (1) acquired immune-differentiation of birth-cohorts, within populations, through developmental epigenetic adaptation (and selection) secondary to maternal or early-life episodes of influenza infection and (2) a triggering context \u2013 emergence of a new sub-type/strain, and its co-circulation (competition?) with seasonal viruses immunologically related to ones that had circulated in the past and primed particular population birth-cohorts.

John Snow conducted pioneering investigations on cholera epidemics in England and particularly in London in 1854 in which he demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source of the epidemics. His thorough investigation of an epidemic in the Soho district of London led to his conclusion that contaminated water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the disease and, consequently, the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. He further studied cholera in London homes that were receiving water from two water supply systems; one from the sewage contaminated portion of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated part of the river. Rates of infection among clients of the distribution system drawing contaminated water far exceeded the, rates among those served by the company whose water intake was from above the contaminated section of the river. This demonstration reinforced the goals of the sanitation movement, which developed sewage drainage systems and water purification systems in cities and towns in the following decades, therewith vastly reducing the threats of cholera, typhoid and many other waterborne diseases. Despite progress being made globally, the public health problems of waterborne disease, including cholera, are by no means gone today, even in high-income countries. The tragic introduction of cholera after the earthquake devastation in Haiti in 2010 resulted in many thousands of cases and deaths from cholera indicating the still-present dangers of diseases spread into disaster situations. Cholera and other waterborne diseases remain some of the heaviest burdens of disease and death in low-income countries, especially after natural disasters or warfare as in Yemen in 2017 and are continuing challenges for global health.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.","journal":"Case Studies in Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f47168b41388764cedefa52cfd0cf1fd2cf5388.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150208.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128045718000172; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128045718000172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["John Snow"],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Soho","London","Broad Street","Thames River","Haiti","Yemen"],"keyphrases":["contaminated water","cholera epidemics","Abstract Cholera","threats of cholera","water intake","water purification systems","water supply systems","tragic introduction of cholera","waterborne diseases","contaminated section","sewage contaminated portion","sewage drainage systems","public health problems of waterborne disease","global health","London homes","Thames River","frequent large-scale epidemics","heaviest burdens of disease","present dangers of diseases","Soho district of London","European cities","low-income countries","key source","Rates of infection","high-income countries","major global scourge","century","pioneering investigations","towns","Yemen","natural disasters","sanitation movement","clients","distribution system","England","Broad Street pump","earthquake devastation","John Snow","continuing challenges","Haiti","conclusion","typhoid","following decades","disaster situations","thousands of cases","goals","warfare","handle","cessation","removal","deaths","company","thorough investigation","Indian subcontinent","demonstration","means","progress"],"language":"en"},

Despite global efforts to prevent and treat virus infections to limit morbidity and mortality, the continued emergence and re-emergence of new outbreaks as well as common infections such as influenza persist as a health threat. Challenges to the prevention of severe disease after virus infection include both a paucity of protective vaccines as well as the early identification of individuals with the highest risk that may require supportive treatment. METHODS: We completed a screen of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) that we infected with influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and West Nile virus. RESULTS: The CC mice exhibited a range of disease manifestations upon infections, and we used this natural variation to identify strains with mortality after infection and strains exhibiting no mortality. We then used comprehensive preinfection immunophenotyping to identify global baseline immune correlates of protection from mortality to virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that immune phenotypes might be leveraged to identify humans at highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes upon infection, who may most benefit from intensive clinical interventions, in addition to providing insight for rational vaccine design.","publish_time":"2020-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graham, Jessica B; Swarts, Jessica L; Menachery, Vineet D; Gralinski, Lisa E; Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Plante, Kenneth S; Morrison, Clayton R; Voss, Kathleen M; Green, Richard; Choonoo, Gabrielle; Jeng, Sophia; Miller, Darla R; Mooney, Michael A; McWeeney, Shannon K; Ferris, Martin T; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Gale, Michael; Heise, Mark T; Baric, Ralph S; Lund, Jennifer M","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d44a32d42af0cad8b32a0535b12e47736030778.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107456.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621854/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiz531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus infections","mortality","common infections","range of clinical outcomes","prevention of severe disease","West Nile virus","highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes","influenza","range of disease manifestations","strains","CC mice","lethal disease","intensive clinical interventions","immune phenotypes","screen of mice","global efforts","global baseline immune correlates of protection","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","addition","continued emergence","re-emergence of new outbreaks","insight","comprehensive preinfection immunophenotyping","humans","host","morbidity","early identification of individuals","paucity of protective vaccines","Collaborative Cross","benefit","rational vaccine design","natural variation","data","supportive treatment","Challenges","health threat","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Here, by taking approaches of reverse genetics, we established a single-round infection system for CVB3. The pseudovirus was produced by sequential transfection of CVB3 capsid expresser plasmid and CVB3 replicon RNA bearing firefly luciferase as a reporter. The CVB3 pseudovirus system was used for quantifying neutralizing antibody (NtAb) levels of 720 human serum samples and showed superior specificity and sensitivity comparing traditional cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Furthermore, we compared the seroprevalence of CVB3 NtAbs in pre-school children and healthy adults, and found that only 11.94% of pre-school children were NtAbs positive which suggested that most children were naive to CVB3 infection; while there is much higher positive rate in adults (60%) indicating that most adults have experienced CVB3 infection during childhood. This rapid and quantitative assay greatly facilitates evaluating the level of NtAbs against CVB3 in populations and will help to advance CVB3 vaccine development.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Pan; Wu, Xing; Mao, Qunying; Gao, Fan; Hao, Xiaotian; Bian, Lianlian; Zhu, Fengcai; Li, Wenhui; Xu, Miao; Liang, Zhenglun","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9e71114eecf03cedc124d3f670b22fdf3a476b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113863.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415300410; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415300410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26947399/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.02.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxsackievirus B3"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experienced CVB3 infection","seroprevalence of CVB3 NtAbs","CVB3 pseudovirus system","CVB3 replicon RNA","CVB3 vaccine development","pre-school children","sequential transfection of CVB3 capsid expresser plasmid","single-round infection system","NtAbs positive","level of NtAbs","healthy adults","quantitative assay","higher positive rate","non-enveloped RNA virus","superior specificity","foot","levels","sensitivity","traditional cytopathic effect","HFMD","mouth disease","human serum samples","quantifying neutralizing antibody","increasing proportion cases of hand","firefly luciferase","prominent health threat","CPE","recent epidemiology studies","account","Abstract Coxsackievirus B3","childhood","populations","reporter","approaches of reverse genetics"],"language":"en"},

Current therapy relies upon a combination of pegylated interferon-\u03B1 and ribavirin, a poorly tolerated regimen typically associated with less than 50% sustained virological response rate in those infected with genotype 1 virus(2,3). The development of direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV has focused predominantly on inhibitors of the viral enzymes NS3 protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B(4). Here we describe the profile of BMS-790052, a small molecule inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein that exhibits picomolar half-maximum effective concentrations (EC(50)) towards replicons expressing a broad range of HCV genotypes and the JFH-1 genotype 2a infectious virus in cell culture. In a phase I clinical trial in patients chronically infected with HCV, administration of a single 100-mg dose of BMS-790052 was associated with a 3.3 log(10) reduction in mean viral load measured 24 h post-dose that was sustained for an additional 120 h in two patients infected with genotype 1b virus. Genotypic analysis of samples taken at baseline, 24 and 144 h post-dose revealed that the major HCV variants observed had substitutions at amino-acid positions identified using the in vitro replicon system. These results provide the first clinical validation of an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, a protein with no known enzymatic function, as an approach to the suppression of virus replication that offers potential as part of a therapeutic regimen based on combinations of HCV inhibitors.

In Vero E6 cells transiently transfected with a cDNA construct for expressing 3a, a similar cleavage was observed. Furthermore, co-expression of 3a, membrane and envelope proteins using the baculovirus system showed that both full-length and truncated 3a can be assembled into virus-like particles.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study, comprising of face-to-face interviews, was conducted between June and December 2013 to assess the public\u2019s awareness and knowledge of MERS and H7N9, including their choice of information source. Respondents were randomly selected and recruited from 3 existing cohort studies. An opportunistic sampling approach was also used to recruit new participants or members in the same household through referrals from existing participants. RESULTS: Out of 2969 participants, 53.2% and 79.4% were not aware of H7N9 and MERS respectively. Participants who were older and better educated were most likely to hear about the diseases. The mean total knowledge score was 9.2 (S.D \u00B1 2.3) out of 20, and 5.9 (S.D \u00B1 1.2) out of 10 for H7N9 and MERS respectively.

The results first showed that wild-type H3 hemagglutinin (HA) (H3-WT), but not a transmembrane domain (TM) mutant, had hetero-protection against both H1N1 and H9N2 with survival rates of 17% and 33% respectively, and that wild-type H1 (H1-WT), H5 (H5-WT) and H9 (H9-WT) had no hetero-protection against H1N1 or H9N2 except for H5-WT against H1N1 with a survival rate of 17%. Then the H3-WT TM replaced the TMs of H1-WT, H5-WT and H9-WT to generate recombinant H1-TM, H5-TM and H9-TM respectively, and whether the H3-WT TM-dependent hetero-protection could be transferred to these TM mutants was investigated. The results showed that the H3-WT TM-dependent hetero-protection was transferable.

Furthermore, higher dosage H5-TM scored 100% hetero-protection against H1N1. These results demonstrated that replacement of the TMs of non-H3 HAs with H3-WT TM could enhance their hetero-protection.

The first part addresses the many and not exclusive mechanisms leading to demyelination in the central nervous system. Although the hypothesis that a primary oligodendrocyte or myelin injury induces a secondary immune response in the central nervous system is still a matter of debate, most recent advances underline the influence of a primary immune response against myelin antigen(s), with a diversity of potential targets. Whereas multiple sclerosis was long considered as a T cell-mediated disease, the role of B lymphocytes is now increasingly recognized, and the influence of antibodies on tissue damage actively investigated. The second part of the review describes the axonal consequences of demyelination. Segmental demyelination results in conduction block or slowing of conduction through adaptative responses, notably related to modifications in the distribution of voltage gated sodium channels along the denuded axon. If demyelination persists, these changes, as well as the loss of trophic and metabolic support, will lead to irreversible axonal damage and loss. In this respect, favouring early myelin repair, during a window of time when axonal damage is still reversible, might pave the way for neuroprotection.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lubetzki, Catherine; Stankoff, Bruno","journal":"Handbook of Clinical Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4854d62a2f804da0c03ed7bb4075fa733627b60a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152443.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444520012000042; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-52001-2.00004-2; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444520012000042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["axonal consequences of demyelination","irreversible axonal damage","Segmental demyelination results","primary immune response","myelin injury","myelin antigen","central nervous system","tissue damage","review","multiple sclerosis","secondary immune response","early myelin repair","conduction block","primary oligodendrocyte","influence of antibodies","loss of trophic","distribution of voltage gated sodium channels","window of time","modifications","matter of debate","T cell-mediated disease","denuded axon","recent advances","metabolic support","role of B lymphocytes","adaptative responses","respect","hypothesis","exclusive mechanisms","diversity of potential targets","way","changes","neuroprotection","parts"],"language":"en"},

Orthopaedic and neurosurgery residents and fellows, as part of this workforce have also experienced some of the uncertainty and stress caused by this pandemic. Concerns exist regarding the effects of the pandemic on spine surgery education due to the cancellation of all elective surgeries. Current Context We explore how this pandemic is affecting orthopaedic and neurosurgery residents and fellows and their spine surgery education and experience. We also examined measures taken by the residency and fellowship programs to protect their residents and fellows, and measures taken by regulatory agencies like the ACGME and the ABOS to give programs some flexibility during these difficult times. Conclusion Orthopaedic and neurosurgery residents and fellows are often on the front lines of patient care. Programs have to ensure adequate resources and training, supervision, and work hour requirements are met. Residents and fellows need to be ready to assist with management of COVID-19 patients if necessary. Residency programs and spine surgery fellowships need to use objective metrics to assess the impact of the pandemic on the spine surgery education of their residents and fellows in order to address any potential area of weakness caused by the decreased exposure to spine surgery.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramos, Omar; Mierke, Alex; Eastin, Marc; Morrison, Martin; Wongworawat, Daniel M.; Danisa, Olumide","journal":"North American Spine Society Journal (NASSJ)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de00fc4444feecc95d4f4c9d18b85ecfe0f925ee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666548420300068?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666548420300068; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xnsj.2020.100006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABOS","Conclusion Orthopaedic"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["neurosurgery residents","spine surgery education","spine surgery fellowships","global pandemic","Residency programs","fellowship programs","Conclusion Orthopaedic","measures","workforce","management of COVID","supervision","unprecedented levels of strain","training","United States healthcare","cancellation","objective metrics","decreased exposure","potential area of weakness","flexibility","ABOS","ACGME","adequate resources","regulatory agencies","impact","order","effects","work hour requirements","Abstract Background","patients","difficult times","experience","lines of patient care","elective surgeries","Current Context","uncertainty","stress","Concerns"],"language":"en"},

Methods We collected data from the University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database, which contains records on all Manitobans diagnosed with IBD from 1984 through 2010 and matched controls. From 1970 individuals\u2019 records can be linked with those of their mothers, so we were able to identify siblings. All health care visits or hospitalizations during the neonatal and postnatal periods were available from 1970 through 2010. We collected data on infections, gastrointestinal illnesses, failure to thrive, and hospital readmission in the first year of life and sociodemographic factors at birth. From 1979, data were available on gestational age, Apgar score, neonatal admission to the intensive care unit, and birth weight. We compared incident rate of infections, gastrointestinal illnesses, and failure to thrive between IBD cases and matched controls as well as between IBD cases and siblings. Results Data on 825 IBD cases and 5999 matched controls were available from 1979. Maternal diagnosis of IBD was the greatest risk factor for IBD in offspring (odds ratio [OR], 4.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.08\u20136.67). When we assessed neonatal events, only being in the highest vs lowest socioeconomic quintile increased risk for later development of IBD (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.79). For events within the first year of life, being in the highest socioeconomic quintile at birth and infections (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09\u20131.79) increased risk for developing IBD at any age. Infection in the first year of life was associated with diagnosis of IBD before age 10 years (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.07\u20138.78) and before age 20 years (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.18\u20132.24). Risk for IBD was not affected by gastrointestinal infections, gastrointestinal disease, or abdominal pain in the first year of life. Conclusions In a population-based study, we found infection within the first year of life to be associated with a diagnosis of IBD. This might be due to use of antibiotics or a physiologic defect at a critical age for gut microbiome development.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bernstein, Charles N.; Burchill, Charles; Targownik, Laura E.; Singh, Harminder; Roos, Leslie L.","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d24604dfb8448378baba480bd54c6162f023886.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094443.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772341/; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2019.02.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508519303749; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508519303749","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background \u0026 Aims","University","Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database","IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBD cases","year of age","Maternal diagnosis of IBD","year of life","later development of IBD","gastrointestinal infections","critical age","gestational age","University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database","gastrointestinal illnesses","neonatal events","matched controls","gastrointestinal disease","birth weight","critical events","Results Data","greatest risk factor","highest vs lowest socioeconomic quintile increased risk","increased risk of inflammatory bowel diseases","highest socioeconomic quintile","neonatal admission","failure","incident rate of infections","population-based study","years","siblings","individuals\u2019 records","intensive care unit","gut microbiome development","health care visits","Apgar score","hospitalizations","offspring","persons","abdominal pain","physiologic defect","postnatal periods","sociodemographic factors","odds ratio","hospital readmission","Conclusions","antibiotics","Methods","confidence interval","Manitobans","mothers","Background"],"language":"en"},

Because it grows well in cell culture, FCV is often used as a model virus of non-culturable caliciviruses. In this study, a cell-free and two cell culture-based biosensor assay systems were established to detect FCV protease activity. The assays utilize luciferase sensor technology or second-generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2). A luciferase sensor was designed to contain an FCV protease cleavage motif within the permutated luciferase (GloSensor). The BRET2-based probe contained the same cleavage motif flanked by a renilla luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein. To confirm the specificity of these assay systems, GloSensor or a BRET2-based probe containing a mutation in the cleavage motif was also constructed. In a cell-free assay, GloSensor showed increased luminescence in proportion to the amount of FCV protease, while no signal change was observed when the construct harboring the mutant cleavage motif was used. A feline cell line stably expressing GloSensor or the BRET2-based probe was established. Increased levels of GloSensor luminescence, and decreased levels of BRET2 signals were observed according to input FCV titers. In contrast, no significant signal change was observed in the cells stably expressing the mutant cleavage motif. GloSensor and the BRET2-based probe were capable of detecting the inhibitory activity of ribavirin in FCV-infected cells. Our results demonstrate that these biosensors are useful to detect FCV protease activity induced in infected cells, and well worth consideration for screening of anti-FCV protease compounds in cell-free system as well as anti-FCV compounds in cultured cells.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oka, Tomoichiro; Takagi, Hirotaka; Tohya, Yukinobu; Murakami, Kosuke; Takeda, Naokazu; Wakita, Takaji; Katayama, Kazuhiko","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127765.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211000301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21316392/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211000301; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCV protease cleavage motif","FCV protease activity","FCV-infected cells","BRET2-based probe","anti-FCV compounds","screening of anti-FCV protease compounds","input FCV titers","cell-free assay","mutant cleavage motif","cell-free system","cell culture-based biosensor assay systems","Increased levels of GloSensor luminescence","feline cell line","permutated luciferase","renilla luciferase","decreased levels of BRET2 signals","cultured cells","luciferase sensor technology","increased luminescence","inhibitory activity of ribavirin","significant signal change","Abstract Feline calicivirus","second-generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer","worth consideration","important veterinary pathogen","respiratory disease","construct","proportion","mutation","variant of green fluorescent protein","model virus of non-culturable caliciviruses","assays","biosensors","cats","contrast","specificity","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Improvements in IPC at the national and facility level are critical for the successful containment of antimicrobial resistance and the prevention of HAI, including outbreaks of highly transmissible diseases through high quality care within the context of universal health coverage. Given the limited availability of IPC evidence-based guidance and standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided to prioritize the development of global recommendations on the core components of effective IPC programmes both at the national and acute health care facility level, based on systematic literature reviews and expert consensus. The aim of the guideline development process was to identify the evidence and evaluate its quality, consider patient values and preferences, resource implications, and the feasibility and acceptability of the recommendations. As a result, 11 recommendations and three good practice statements are presented here, including a summary of the supporting evidence, and form the substance of a new WHO IPC guideline.

However, few studies have discussed how to judge the adequacy of confounding adjustment. This study aims to compare the performance of commonly adopted model selection criteria in terms of providing a reliable and valid estimate for the health impact of influenza. METHODS: We assessed four model selection criteria: quasi Akaike information criterion (QAIC), quasi Bayesian information criterion (QBIC), partial autocorrelation functions of residuals (PACF), and generalized cross-validation (GCV), by separately applying them to select the Poisson model best fitted to the mortality datasets that were simulated under the different assumptions of seasonal confounding. The performance of these criteria was evaluated by the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimates from the pre-determined coefficients of influenza proxy variable. These four criteria were subsequently applied to an empirical hospitalization dataset to confirm the findings of simulation study. RESULTS: GCV consistently provided smaller biases and RMSEs for the influenza coefficient estimates than QAIC, QBIC and PACF, under the different simulation scenarios. Sensitivity analysis of different pre-determined influenza coefficients, study periods and lag weeks showed that GCV consistently outperformed the other criteria. Similar results were found in applying these selection criteria to estimate influenza-associated hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: GCV criterion is recommended for selection of Poisson models to estimate influenza-associated mortality and morbidity burden with proper adjustment for confounding. These findings shall help standardize the Poisson modeling approach for influenza disease burden studies.","publish_time":"2012-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xi-Ling; Yang, Lin; Chan, King-Pan; Chiu, Susan S.; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Peiris, J.

An aerosol was released within a patient room and concentrations measured in the room and hallway with and without surge control ventilation system modifications. The average hallway protection efficiencies were high (\u003E98%) both for the baseline ventilation configuration and when the ventilation system was modified for whole floor negative pressure, indicating very little PM reached the hallway. During entry/exit events through the patient room door into the hallway, the average minimum hallway protection efficiencies were lower during the modified ventilation operation (93\u201394%) than for the baseline operation (98\u201399%). These lower hallway protection efficiencies may be explained by the 52% reduction in the outdoor air ventilation being supplied to the hallway during the modified operation mode. This suggests that patient room doors should remain closed to control PM movement into the hallway.

Other polyomaviruses (BKPyV and JCPyV) have been associated with illness in immunocompromised patients, and some studies suggest a higher prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV in this population. Objective To determine whether a higher prevalence or viral load for WUPyV and KIPyV exists in immunocompromised children compared with immunocompetent children. Study design We measured the prevalence and viral load of WU and KI PyV by quantitative real-time PCR of viral DNA in respiratory tract specimens from pediatric hematology/oncology patients and immunocompetent controls with acute respiratory illnesses. Results The prevalence of WUPyV in the immunocompromised population was 5/161 (3%) versus 14/295 (5%) in the control population (P =0.5), and 9/161 (5.6%) versus 7/295 (2.3%) respectively for KIPyV (P =0.13). The mean viral load (in copies per cell or mL of sample) for KIPyV, was higher in the immunocompromised group compared to the control group (P =0.019), but was not statistically different for WUPyV. A higher prevalence was seen in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients compared with other immunocompromised patients (6/26 versus 3/43, P =0.054). Viral persistence was demonstrated only in 1/25 (4%) of sequential samples for KIPyV, and no persistence was seen for WUPyV. Conclusions A higher prevalence of WUPyV or KIPyV in the immunocompromised population compared with the immunocompetent group was not demonstrated. Higher viral loads for KIPyV in the immunocompromised group may suggest an increased pathogenic potential in this population.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, Suchitra; Garcea, Robert L.; Robinson, Christine C.; Sim\u00F5es, Eric A.F.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/086405d3b265bdcff4df2dd9f5b1d9dea52a2261.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3816538.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21705268/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321100196X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2011.05.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321100196X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["WU"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KIPyV","immunocompromised population","higher prevalence of WUPyV","immunocompromised group","immunocompromised patients","immunocompromised children","Higher viral loads","Viral persistence","viral load of WU","immunocompetent group","control population","mean viral load","immunocompetent children","control group","respiratory tract samples","respiratory tract specimens","KI PyV","quantitative real-time PCR of viral DNA","oncology patients","immunocompetent controls","KI polyomaviruses","acute respiratory illnesses","sequential samples","Abstract Background WU","hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","pediatric hematology","copies","studies","increased pathogenic potential","adults","JCPyV","Conclusions","Study design","BKPyV","Objective"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we compared two PA-X-deficient mutant viruses and the parental virus in terms of induction of pathology and manipulation of host response in the mouse lung, stimulation of cell death and PA nuclear accumulation. We first found that down-regulated PA-X expression markedly aggravated the acute lung injury of the infected mice early on day 1 post-infection (p.i.).

Under in vitro conditions, neuronal cells could be a useful tool to study the CHPV interaction with neuronal proteins. The information gathered from such studies will help to design the new therapeutics for CHPV infection. This study identified the surface vimentin protein involved in adsorption of CHPV on Neuro-2a cell line (mouse neuroblastoma cells). The decrease in CHPV infectivity to Neuro-2a cells was observed in the presence of recombinant vimentin or anti-vimentin antibody. Vimentin mRNA expression remains unaltered in CHPV infected Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted the residues in vimentin and CHPV glycoprotein (G); probably involved in cell-virus interactions. Overall, we conclude that surface vimentin in Neuro-2a cells interact with CHPV and facilitate the binding of CHPV to the cells; it could be acting as a co-receptor for the CHPV. Further investigation is necessary to confirm the exact role of vimentin in CHPV infection in neuronal cells.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kavathekar, Vishal K; Dhanavade, Maruti J; D Sonawane, Kailash; Balakrishnan, Anukumar","journal":"Virus research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/129068ec3499133ac0dea0dfd68abb1ad4949453.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220300654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418904/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220300654?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHPV infection","CHPV interaction","adsorption of CHPV","CHPV glycoprotein","CHPV infectivity","binding of CHPV","CHPV infected Neuro","neuronal cells","surface vimentin protein","exact role of vimentin","Vimentin mRNA expression","presence of recombinant vimentin","anti-vimentin antibody","mouse neuroblastoma cells","neuronal proteins","study","cell-virus interactions","cell line","neurotropic behavior of Chandipura virus","residues","useful tool","new therapeutics","silico analysis","decrease","studies","investigation","co-receptor","conditions","experimental animals","information"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the genetic co-variation of viruses and different populations of the same bat species, although such information is needed for an understanding of virus transmission dynamics within a given host species. We hypothesized that if virus transmission between host populations depends on events linked to gene flow in the bats, genetic co-variation should exist between host populations and astroviruses. RESULTS: We used 19 nuclear and one mitochondrial microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic population structure of the Natterer\u2019s bat (Myotis nattereri) within and among populations at different geographical scales in Germany. Further, we correlated the observed bat population structure to that of partial astrovirus sequences (323\u2013394 nt fragments of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) obtained from the same bat populations. Our analyses revealed that the studied bat colonies can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to the three geographic regions sampled. Furthermore, we observed an overall isolation-by-distance pattern, while no significant pattern was observed within a geographic region. Moreover, we found no correlation between the genetic distances among the bat populations and the astrovirus sequences they harbored. Even though high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions was detected, identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic population structure of the bat host suggests that mating sites where several local breeding colonies meet act as stepping-stones for gene flow. Identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions suggesting that astroviruses are mostly transmitted among host colonies at the local scale. Nevertheless, high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions implies that occasional transmission across regions with subsequent mutations of the virus haplotypes does occur.

To maintain hospital function under critical situations such as a pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that increase and decrease the willingness to work. Previous hospital-based studies have examined this question using hypothetical events, but so far it has not been examined in an actual pandemic. Here, we surveyed the factors that influenced the motivation and hesitation of hospital workers to work in Japan soon after the pandemic (H1N1) 2009. METHODS: Self-administered anonymous questionnaires about demographic character and stress factors were distributed to all 3635 employees at three core hospitals in Kobe city, Japan and were collected from June to July, 2009, about one month after the pandemic (H1N1) in Japan. RESULTS: Of a total of 3635 questionnaires distributed, 1693 (46.7%) valid questionnaires were received. 28.4% (N = 481) of workers had strong motivation and 14.7% (N = 249) had strong hesitation to work. Demographic characters and stress-related questions were categorised into four types according to the odds ratios (OR) of motivation and hesitation to work: some factors increased motivation and lowered hesitation; others increased motivation only; others increased hesitation only and others increased both motivation and hesitation. The strong feeling of being supported by the national and local governments (Multivariate OR: motivation; 3.5; CI 2.2-5.4, hesitation; 0.2; CI 0.1-0.6) and being protected by hospital (Multivariate OR: motivation; 2.8; CI 2.2-3.7, hesitation; 0.5; CI 0.3-0.7) were related to higher motivation and lower hesitation. Here, protection included taking precautions to prevent illness among workers and their families, providing for the care of those who do become ill, reducing malpractice threats, and financial support for families of workers who die on duty. But 94.1% of the respondents answered protection by the national and local government was weak and 79.7% answered protection by the hospital was weak. CONCLUSIONS: Some factors have conflicting effects because they increase both motivation and hesitation. Giving workers the feeling that they are being protected by the national and local government and hospital is especially valuable because it increases their motivation and lowers their hesitation to work.","publish_time":"2010-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imai, Hissei; Matsuishi, Kunitaka; Ito, Atsushi; Mouri, Kentaro; Kitamura, Noboru; Akimoto, Keiko; Mino, Koichi; Kawazoe, Ayako; Isobe, Masanori; Takamiya, Shizuo; Mita, Tatsuo","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8a55f01d9e4a3e3b77512767ab78bb8d1d74a25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3091577.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21050482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["hesitation of hospital workers","strong motivation","strong hesitation","higher motivation","lowered hesitation","lower hesitation","professionalism of hospital workers","Japan","families of workers","hospital function","stress factors","protection","actual pandemic","H1N1","Previous hospital-based studies","strong feeling","local governments","valid questionnaires","Self-administered anonymous questionnaires","stress-related questions","Demographic characters","core hospitals","financial support","malpractice threats","Kobe city","types","employees","METHODS","critical situations","illness","conflicting effects","CONCLUSIONS","odds ratios","precautions","BACKGROUND","hypothetical events","care","total","respondents","duty","month","RESULTS","willingness"],"language":"en"},

A successful colostrum management program requires producers to consistently provide calves with a sufficient volume of clean, high-quality colostrum within the first few hours of life.

Conventional microbiological methods included blood and sputum cultures, acute and convalescent serologic samples, and antigen urinary detection. New methods included multiplex PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and 15 respiratory viruses. A total of 169 patients were included. Using conventional methods, we identified a pathogen in 51 % of cases. With PCR, up to 70 % of cases had an aetiological diagnosis. Forty-five patients had BP (34 %), 22 had VP (17 %) and 25 (19 %) had co-infection (BP and VP). Pneumococci and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) median values were significantly higher in BP than in VP patients. Shaking chills, higher CURB score and shock were significantly more frequent in BP. A viral infection was identified in more than one-third of patients with CAP.

To this end, we propose a simple model of infection that enables to study the coincidence time of two random walkers on an arbitrary graph. By studying the coincidence time of a susceptible and an infected individual both moving in the graph we obtain estimates of the infection probability. The main result of this paper is to pinpoint the impact of the network topology on the infection probability. More precisely, we prove that for homogeneous graphs including regular graphs and the classical Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00E9nyi model, the coincidence time is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the graph. We then study the model on power-law graphs, that exhibit heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and show the existence of a phase transition for the coincidence time depending on the parameter of the power-law of the degree distribution. We finally undertake a preliminary analysis for the case with k random walkers and provide upper bounds on the convergence time for both the complete graph and regular graphs.","publish_time":"2010-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Draief, Moez; Ganesh, Ayalvadi","journal":"Discret Event Dyn Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6022c23ba00765057ef78e895b1a227fa4b0dc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coincidence time","regular graphs","convergence time","complete graph","arbitrary graph","power-law graphs","random walkers","homogeneous graphs","infection probability","simple model of infection","R\u00E9nyi model","underlying network topology","mobile performing independent random walks","users","classical Erd\u0151s","dissemination of information","spread","upper bounds","heterogeneous connectivity patterns","existence","virus","effect","case","phase transition","parameter","infected individual","number of nodes","paper","impact","degree distribution","estimates","preliminary analysis","main result","question"],"language":"en"},

The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA. Treatment focused in the cytokine environment is an interesting area that could impact the prognosis of CAP. Some of the agents that have been studied as co-adjuvant therapy are corticosteroids, macrolides, and linezolid, but anyone of those have shown a clear or proven efficacy or have been recommended as a part of the standard of care for CAP. More studies designed to define the role of immunomodulatory agents, such as co-adjuvant therapy in pneumonia, are needed.","publish_time":"2016-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rendon, Adrian; Rendon-Ramirez, Erick J.; Rosas-Taraco, Adrian G.","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c7ce7326321077d4ff13109ab29eb9ee964c905.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia","lung injury","acute lung infection","co-adjuvant therapy","cytokine response","Cytokines","severe lung infection cases","role of immunomodulatory agents","cytokine environment","systemic inflammatory response","major players","bacterial vs viral infections","corticosteroids","macrolides","clinical severity scales","leading cause of infectious death","CURB65","interesting area","CAP","Immune dysregulation","years","world","SOFA","studies","prognosis of","review of published papers","proven efficacy","standard of care","linezolid","Treatment","Community","topic"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: A MEDLINE search of the literature from 1966 to 1995 was done, using \u201CBronchitis\u201D as the key word. Papers addressing acute bronchitis in adults were used as well as several citations emphasizing pediatric infections. A manual search of papers addressing the microorganisms causing acute bronchitis was also done. Data were extracted manually from relevant publications. SETTING: All published reports were reviewed. Papers dealing with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were excluded in this review. RESULTS: Although acute bronchitis has multiple causes, the large majority of cases are of viral etiology.Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, andBordetella pertussis are the only bacteria identified as contributing to the cause of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults. Nine double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were reviewed. Four studies showed no advantage for doxycycline and one study showed no advantage for erythromycin. One study using erythromycin and one study using trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole showed that these antibiotics were slightly better than placebo. Two other studies showed an impressive superiority for liquid or inhaled albuterol when compared with erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies showed no significant difference between drug and placebo, and the two studies that did showed only small clinical differences. Albuterol had an impressive advantage over erythromycin. Antibiotics should not be used in the treatment of acute bronchitis in healthy persons unless convincing evidence of a bacterial infection is present.","publish_time":"1996-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacKay, Donald N.","journal":"J Gen Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8169ef175396f5d0d1bc79398ef449f45a9a19af.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzYz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Albuterol"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cause of acute bronchitis","bronchodilator treatment of acute bronchitis","studies","erythromycin","exacerbations of chronic bronchitis","study","impressive advantage","healthy adults","manual search of papers","antibiotics","placebo-controlled trials","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","healthy persons","impressive superiority","inhaled albuterol","MEDLINE search","viral etiology","convincing evidence","patients","large majority of cases","multiple causes","andBordetella pertussis","liquid","lung disease","microorganisms","bacterial infection","significant difference","drug","trimethoprim","doxycycline","sulfamethoxazole","RESULTS","small clinical differences","citations","pediatric infections","Data","relevant publications","SETTING","published reports","DESIGN","literature","CONCLUSIONS","key word","review","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks.","publish_time":"2006-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colizza, V.; Barrat, A.; Barth\u00E9lemy, M.; Vespignani, A.","journal":"Bull Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c300e9a83f6ea8497c700246959aa0fcfc99924.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Air Transport Association"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global spreading of infectious diseases","spreading pattern","global spread of emergent diseases","epidemic pattern predictability","global propagation pattern of emerging diseases","stochastic computational framework","risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks","airline transportation network","travel time","travel flows","intrinsic stochastic nature","general computational framework","presence of stochastic fluctuations","occurrence of epidemic pathways","geographical space","disease transmission","particular shrinks","reliability of numerical forecast","different geographical regions","census population data","database","advantage","analysis of containment policies","complete International Air Transport Association","respect","modeling","quantitative characterization","populated areas","backbone of dominant connections","main channels","large-scale properties","information theory approach","heterogeneity level","presented results","world\u0027s","role","structure","paper"],"language":"en"},

The encoded protein shared 97.79% amino acid identities compared with CV777, 97.35% with Br1/87, 97.79% with JMe2, 96.90% with KPEDV-9 (Korean field isolate), 96.46% with KPEDV-9 (Korean). Sequence analysis of the M gene, including genetic distance measurement, phylogenetic tree analysis, and residue substitution analysis, showed that all other PED viruses analyzed fell into three groups, and the LJB/03 itself branched in an independent group. These data revealed that the M gene nucleotide sequence of LJB/03 has some mutations in comparison with the other PED viruses.","publish_time":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jinghui, Fan; Yijing, Li","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d40fdfacdcea332d646d748b3dbabb7831dd54c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","LJB","KPEDV"],"locations":["Heilongjiang","China"],"keyphrases":["gene of LJB","gene nucleotide sequence of LJB","KPEDV","Sequence analysis","gene cDNA","Sequence comparison","Korean field isolate","PEDV strains","PEDV isolates","amino acid protein","high sequence homology","PED viruses","JMe2","CV777","Br1","phylogenetic tree analysis","residue substitution analysis","amino acid identities","fece samples","fece of piglets","encoded protein","genetic distance measurement","pig farm","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","RT-PCR","Heilongjiang province","China","nucleotides","open reading frame","pMD18-T vector","base composition","GenBank","groups","mutations","adenines","RNA","data","independent group","cytosines","guanines","thymines"],"language":"en"},

However, little research has examined the factors that underlie initial worry about infection and subsequent behavioral responses to such worry. PURPOSE: This study seeks to model some key predictors of worry and behavioral responses in the early stages of the swine flu pandemic (WHO pandemic stage 5). METHOD: A cross-sectional internet questionnaire study (N = 186). RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of respondents rated themselves as worried about being a victim of swine flu, 40% that they were worried of a family member contracting the virus. Twenty percent had bought, or intended to buy, preparatory materials (e.g., face masks), 20% intended to delay or cancel air travel. In a structural equation model, conservation values and family or friends perception of risks predicted worry about infection, while worry correlated with the purchase of preparatory materials, a lesser willingness to travel by public transport, and difficulty in focusing on everyday activities. CONCLUSION: While previous research on pandemic risk perception has focused on cognitive risk judgments, our data suggests that initial \u201Cemotional\u201D concerns about infection are also significant predictors of behavioral responses to pandemic threat. Such worry is likely to be influenced by a variety of individual factors, such as personal values, as well as normative pressures. Practitioners can use and expand on such models of pandemic response when tailoring health campaigns to meet newly emergent threats.","publish_time":"2010-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodwin, Robin; Gaines, Stanley O.; Myers, Lynn; Neto, Felix","journal":"Int J Behav Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99ff87aada004adbc44b03e1b7134e6508ed985d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090401/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzIxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["initial worry","swine flu pandemic","pandemic risk perception","infection","pandemic threat","pandemic stage","key predictors of worry","subsequent behavioral responses","models of pandemic response","victim of swine flu","significant predictors of behavioral responses","purchase of preparatory materials","conservation values","personal values","early stages","previous research","family member","public transport","little research","percent of respondents","air travel","friends perception of risks","cognitive risk judgments","variety of individual factors","structural equation model","widespread public concern","cross-sectional internet questionnaire study","health campaigns","lesser willingness","data","concerns","difficulty","METHOD","emergence of influenza","emergent threats","face masks","CONCLUSION","normative pressures","everyday activities","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","virus","PURPOSE","Practitioners"],"language":"en"},

It has been estimated that virtually all children have had at least one RSV infection by their second birthday. RSV is responsible for annual disease outbreaks, usually during a defined winter seasonal period that can vary by community and year. RSV is recognized as the leading cause of hospitalization among young children worldwide. Infants of young chronologic age and children with predisposing factors, such as premature birth, pulmonary disease, or congenital heart disease, are most susceptible to serious illness. Unlike other viruses, immunity to RSV infection is incomplete and short lived, and reinfection is common throughout life. Initial attempts to develop a vaccine in the 1960s met with unexpected and tragic results; many children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated wild-type virus developed serious pulmonary disease upon subsequent natural infection. Numerous other vaccine technologies have since been studied, including vectored approaches, virus-like particles, DNA vaccines, and live attenuated virus vaccine. As of early 2010, only two companies or institutions had RSV vaccine candidates in early clinical trials, and no vaccine is likely to be licensed for marketing in the immediate future.","publish_time":"2011-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Groothuis, Jessie R.; Hoopes, J.

Through targeted recombination and reverse genetic manipulation, studies of infection with MHV-JHM variants have identified phenotypic differences and examined the effects of these differences on viral pathogenesis and anti-viral host immune responses. Studies employing recombinant viruses with a modified spike (S) glycoprotein of MHV-JHM have identified the S gene as a major determinant of neurovirulence. However, the association of S gene variation and neurovirulence with host ability to generate anti-viral CD8 T cell responses is not completely clear. Partially protective anti-viral immune responses may result in persistent infection and chronic demyelinating disease characterized by myelin removal from axons of the CNS and associated with dense macrophage/microglial infiltration. Demyelinating disease during MHV-JHM infection is immune-mediated, as mice that lack T lymphocytes fail to develop disease despite succumbing to encephalitis with high levels of infectious virus in the CNS. However, the presence of T lymphocytes or anti-viral antibody can induce disease in infected immunodeficient mice. The mechanisms by which these immune effectors induce demyelination share an ability to activate and recruit macrophages and microglia, thus increasing the putative role of these cells in myelin destruction.","publish_time":"2007-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Templeton, Steven P.; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fdaea29b56a775bb744d83dc53efa52f55be1ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-JHM infection","chronic viral infection","Infection of mice","anti-viral host immune responses","anti-viral antibody","MHV-JHM variants","protective anti-viral immune responses","viral pathogenesis","studies of infection","anti-viral CD8 T cell responses","persistent infection","strain JHM","CNS","chronic demyelinating disease","glycoprotein of MHV","immune effectors","host ability","presence of T lymphocytes","association of S gene variation","infected immunodeficient mice","variants of mouse hepatitis virus","myelin removal","phenotypic differences","myelin destruction","major determinant of neurovirulence","high levels of infectious virus","reverse genetic manipulation","modified spike","central nervous system","models of acute","encephalitis","effects","targeted recombination","putative role","recombinant viruses","cells","dense macrophage","axons","microglial infiltration","recruit macrophages","demyelination","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

The translated ssRNA (\u002B) genome of Zika virus was explored in EMBOSS antigenic and VaxiJen to predict 63 peptides as potential antigens. Three MHC-II binding peptide prediction tools, viz. NetMHCIIpan, PREDIVAC and immune epitope database (IEDB) were employed in consensus on 63 antigenic peptides to propose 14 T-helper cell epitopes. Similarly, analysis on 63 antigenic peptides through NetMHC, NetCTL and IEDB MHC-I binding peptide prediction tool led to identification of 14 CTL epitopes. Seven T-cell epitopes, C:44-66, M:135-149, NS2A:124-144, NS3:421-453, NS3:540-554, NS4B:90-134 and NS4B:171-188, are observed to share overlapping MHC-I and MHC-II binding motifs and hence, are being proposed to constitute minimum T-cell antigens to elicit protective T-cell immune response against Zika. Three of them, C:44-66, NS3:421-453 and NS3:540-554 are identified to be conserved across all the selected strains of Zika virus. Moreover, the 21 T-cell epitopes are non-self to humans and exhibited good coverage in variable populations of 14 geographical locations.

Computer simulations have been used successfully in other industries as training and analysis tools. This paper describes an agent-based simulation for food defense training and analysis. Production information, consumption patterns, morbidity/mortality rates, recall costs and additional information were collected and provided to a data-driven simulation to anticipate the impact of decision-making on economic and public health during a terrorist attack. A case study is given with a representative exercise involving forty industry representatives who participated in a food defense simulation. Their decisions (recall and microbiological and toxicological testing) were derived from testing results, press releases, epidemiological data, and discussions with other industry and regulatory teams. Decisions made during the simulation resulted in over 76,000 illnesses, 45 deaths, and $132 million in recall costs. The no intervention, baseline scenario estimated to result in 91,000 illnesses and 54 deaths, indicating the improved public health outcomes resulting from players\u2019 decisions. Participants identified three key learning points: 1) communication between all groups is pertinent and challenging, 2) approaches to solve inherent food safety problems cannot be used to address food defense situations, and 3) human resource procedures regarding new hires and disgruntled employees should involve additional security measures. This computer simulation could be a valuable resource in food defense awareness and help educate companies and regulators about food defense risks and decision-making consequences.","publish_time":"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaturvedi, Alok; Armstrong, Brian; Chaturvedi, Rashmi","journal":"Health Technol (Berl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24e4e9e5c492f097689ec01deeacd082dc9006fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091043.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091043/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food defense simulation","food industry","food defense training","food supply","food defense awareness","food defense risks","food defense situations","inherent food safety problems","data-driven simulation","recall costs","agent-based simulation","impact of decision-making","decision-making consequences","additional information","importance of decision-making","industry representatives","players\u2019 decisions","deaths","illnesses","valuable resource","testing results","improved public health outcomes","toxicological testing","epidemiological data","points of vulnerability","Production information","bioterrorist attack","analysis tools","supply chain","Computer simulations","human resource procedures","additional security measures","key learning points","companies","disgruntled employees","morbidity","regulators","help","new hires","mortality rates","consumption patterns","approaches","discussions","response programs","press releases","communication","representative exercise","integrated crisis management","groups","Participants","regulatory teams","industries","paper","aftermath","case study","baseline scenario","intervention"],"language":"en"},

We identified that four residues appear to be involved in protein folding/structure and four residues are important for viral entry. An improved entry interference assay was developed and used to study the role of these residues that are important for viral entry. It was found that R64 and K95 are involved in receptor binding. In contrast, some residues such as I170 are important for viral entry, but do not play a major role in receptor binding as indicated by entry interference assay and/or protein binding data, suggesting that these residues are involved in post-binding steps of viral entry. Furthermore, our results also suggested that Ebola and Marburg viruses share a common cellular molecule for entry.","publish_time":"2011-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jizhen; Manicassamy, Balaji; Caffrey, Michael; Rong, Lijun","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fae9474725400c9be6f28818e571b7adb3ceba6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["post-binding steps of viral entry","receptor binding","Ebola GP1 residues","improved entry interference assay","receptor-binding domain","protein binding data","Ebola virus infection","binding of glycoprotein GP protein","Ebola virion","human immunodeficiency virus","fusion of virus","protein folding","non-human primates","major role","severe hemorrhagic fever","HIV","roles","Marburg viruses","based pseudotyping system","common cellular molecule","cells","I170","high mortality","cell membrane","structure","alanine scanning substitutions","K95","R64","results","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Currently all protein 3D structures in the PDB are in Cartesian coordinates. We wanted to explore the possibility that protein 3D structures, especially the globular type (spheroproteins), when represented in spherical coordinates might find useful novel applications. A Fortran program was written to transform protein 3D structure files in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to spherical coordinates (\u03C1, \u03D5, \u03B8), with the centroid of the protein molecule as origin. We present here two applications, namely, (1) separation of the protein outer layer (OL) from the inner core (IC); and (2) identifying protrusions and invaginations on the protein surface. In the first application, \u03D5 and \u03B8 were partitioned into suitable intervals and the point with maximum \u03C1 in each such \u2018\u03D5-\u03B8 bin\u2019 was determined. A suitable cutoff value for \u03C1 is adopted, and for each \u03D5-\u03B8 bin, all points with \u03C1 values less than the cutoff are considered part of the IC, and those with \u03C1 values equal to or greater than the cutoff are considered part of the OL. We show that this separation procedure is successful as it gives rise to an OL that is significantly more enriched in hydrophilic amino acid residues, and an IC that is significantly more enriched in hydrophobic amino acid residues, as expected. In the second application, the point with maximum \u03C1 in each \u03D5-\u03B8 bin are sequestered and their frequency distribution constructed (i.e., maximum \u03C1\u2019s sorted from lowest to highest, collected into 1.50\u00C5-intervals, and the frequency in each interval plotted). We show in such plots that invaginations on the protein surface give rise to subpeaks or shoulders on the lagging side of the main peak, while protrusions give rise to similar subpeaks or shoulders, but on the leading side of the main peak. We used the dataset of Laskowski et al. (1996) to demonstrate both applications.","publish_time":"2011-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reyes, Vicente M.","journal":"Interdiscip Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e9895f931545d869a253baa1a79448e23ec35b3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maximum \u03C1","protein surface","\u03D5-\u03B8 bin","protein molecule","Cartesian coordinates","spherical coordinates","\u03C1 values equal","rise","protein outer layer","D structures","shoulders","protrusions","suitable intervals","invaginations","suitable cutoff value","main peak","hydrophilic amino acid residues","hydrophobic amino acid residues","D structure files","useful novel applications","similar subpeaks","frequency distribution","\u00C5-intervals","separation procedure","PDB","points","globular type","cylindrical coordinate systems","centroid","inner core","spheroproteins","origin","plots","possibility","Three-dimensional objects","Fortran program","dataset of Laskowski"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Human mast cells were enzymatically dispersed from tonsil and skin tissues. The dispersed cells were then cultured with various stimuli, and tryptase and histamine levels in cell supernatants collected from challenge tubes were measured. Results: PAR\u20102 agonist peptide SLIGKV provoked a dose\u2010dependent release of histamine from skin mast cells. It also induced tryptase release from tonsil mast cells. tc\u2010LIGRLO appeared less potent than SLIGKV in induction of release of histamine and tryptase.

METHODS: An enzyme inhibition assay against HpCGS was carried out by using a continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay approach. The inhibition assay of HpFabD was performed based on the \u03B1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-coupled system, while the inhibition assay for HpFabZ was monitored by detecting the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm with crotonoyl-CoA conversion to \u03B2-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The juglone/FabZ complex crystal was obtained by soaking juglone into the HpFabZ crystal, and the X-ray crystal structure of the complex was analyzed by molecular replacement approach. RESULTS: Juglone was shown to potently inhibit HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ with the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC(50) values of 7.0\u00B10.7, 20\u00B11, and 30\u00B14 \u03BCmol/L, respectively. An inhibition-type study indicated that juglone was a non-competitive inhibitor of HpCGS against O-succinyl-L-homoserine (K(i)=\u03B1K(i)=24 \u03BCmol/L), an uncompetitive inhibitor of HpFabD against malonyl-CoA (\u03B1K(i)=7.4 \u03BCmol/L), and a competitive inhibitor of HpFabZ against crotonoyl-CoA (K(i)=6.8 \u03BCmol/L). Moreover, the crystal structure of the HpFabZ/juglone complex further revealed the essential binding pattern of juglone against HpFabZ at the atomic level. CONCLUSION: HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ are potential targets of juglone.","publish_time":"2008-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kong, Yun-hua; Zhang, Liang; Yang, Zheng-yi; Han, Cong; Hu, Li-hong; Jiang, Hua-liang; Shen, Xu","journal":"Acta Pharmacol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a4762f0398e93185c6cffdb4879674ca7c84bab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Helicobacter"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HpFabZ crystal","juglone complex","inhibition assay of HpFabD","competitive inhibitor of HpFabZ","\u03BCmol","malonyl-CoA","natural product juglone","potential targets of juglone","enzyme inhibition assay","uncompetitive inhibitor of HpFabD","non-competitive inhibitor of HpCGS","inhibition features","essential binding pattern of juglone","crotonoyl-CoA conversion","FabZ complex crystal","X-ray crystal structure","inhibition-type study","continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay approach","\u03B1K","\u03B2-hydroxyacyl","\u03B2-hydroxybutyryl","molecular replacement approach","cystathionine \u03B3-synthase","Helicobacter pylori","acyl carrier protein transacylase","key enzymes","half maximal inhibitory concentration IC","nm","system","O-succinyl","ACP dehydratase","\u03B1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase","naphthoquinone","values","absorbance","decrease","METHODS","atomic level","homoserine","AIM","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The treatment of synchronized ASM cells from asthmatic rats with PKC-specific agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and antagonist 2-{1-[3-(amidinothio) propyl]-1H-indol-3-yl}-3-(1-methylindol-3-yl) maleimide methanesulfonate salt (Ro31-8220) was followed by the proliferation assay. PKC\u03B1 and cyclinD1 expressions in ASM cells (ASMC) were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The relation between PKC\u03B1 and cyclinD1 was assessed by linear regression analysis. The effect of the construct recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-antisense cyclinD1 (pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1) on the proliferation of ASMC was found to be induced by PMA. RESULTS: The data showed phorbol ester-dependent PKC\u03B1 promoted the proliferation of ASMC. The closely-positive correlation existed between the expression of PKC\u03B1 and cyclinD1 at the transcriptional (r=0.821, P\u003C0.01) and transla-tional (r=0.940, P\u003C0.01) levels. pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1 could inhibit the proliferation of ASMC. pcDNA3.1-ascyclinD1 almost completely attenuated the PMA-induced proliferation effect as Ro31-8220\u002BpcDNA3.1. CONCLUSION: The proliferation of ASMC by PKC might by regulated by the cyclinD1 expression in asthmatic rats.","publish_time":"2008-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiao, Li-fen; Xu, Yong-jian; Liu, Xian-sheng; Xie, Jun-gang; Wang, Jin; Du, Chun-ling; Zhang, Jian; Ni, Wang; Chen, Shi-xin","journal":"Acta Pharmacol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/880d1a35d78d6a738235c26d02474b05f3da643d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PKC","ASM","ASMC","PMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proliferation of ASMC","expression of cyclinD1","antisense cyclinD1","cyclinD1 expressions","expression of PKC\u03B1","PMA-induced proliferation effect","proliferation assay","ascyclinD1","asthmatic rats","PKC-specific agonist phorbol","phorbol ester-dependent PKC\u03B1","Ro31","construct recombinant plasmid pcDNA3","treatment of synchronized ASM cells","underlying molecular mechanisms of PKC","asthmatic airway smooth muscle","remodeling","key regulator of growth control","myristate","data","maleimide methanesulfonate salt","protein kinase C","acetate","H-indol","RT-PCR","linear regression analysis","propyl","Western blotting","RESULTS","METHODS","transla-tional","S transition","positive correlation","amidinothio","AIM","methylindol","antagonist","CONCLUSION","levels"],"language":"en"},

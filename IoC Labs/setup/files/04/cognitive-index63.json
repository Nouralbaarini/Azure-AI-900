It has been proposed that CIRE/mDC-SIGN is the functional orthologue of human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN), a molecule that both enhances T cell responses and facilitates antigen uptake. We assessed if CIRE/mDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGN exhibit functional similarities. CIRE/mDC-SIGN is down-regulated upon activation, but unlike hDC-SIGN, incubation with IL-4 and IL-13 did not enhance CIRE/mDC-SIGN expression, indicating differences in gene regulation. Like hDC-SIGN, CIRE/mDC-SIGN bound mannosylated residues. However, we could detect no role for CIRE/mDC-SIGN in T cell\u2013DC interactions and the protein did not bind to pathogens known to interact with hDC-SIGN, including Leishmania mexicana, cytomegalovirus, HIV and lentiviral particles bearing the Ebolavirus glycoprotein. The binding of CIRE/mDC-SIGN to hDC-SIGN ligands was not rescued when CIRE/mDC-SIGN was engineered to express the stalk region of hDC-SIGN.

We argue that progress in translating existing knowledge into widespread benefit will require a nationwide effort to intervene comprehensively in neighborhoods and communities of concentrated disadvantage. We present a strategic plan for how such an effort could be organized.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Open-label, randomized, pilot study in a university hospital medical intensive care unit and experimental laboratory. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients with septic shock and eight healthy controls. INTERVENTIONS: Patients (five per group) requiring parenteral nutrition received intravenously either a \u03C9-3 or a \u03C9-6 lipid emulsion for a 10-day period. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At baseline levels of plasma free fatty acids were elevated several-fold, including high concentrations of the \u03C9-6 lipid precursor arachidonic acid (AA). Neutrophils isolated from septic patients displayed markedly reduced responsiveness to ex vivo stimulation, including lipid mediator generation [leukotrienes (LT), PAF], respiratory burst, and phosphoinositide hydrolysis signaling. Under the \u03C9-6 lipid infusion regimen abnormalities in plasma free fatty acids and impairment of neutrophil functions persisted or worsened. In contrast, a rapid switch in the plasma free fatty acid fraction to predominance of the \u03C9-3 acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid over AA occurred in response to \u03C9-3 lipid infusion. LTB(5), in addition to LTB(4), appeared upon neutrophil stimulation originating from these patients, and neutrophil function was significantly improved in the \u03C9-3 lipid group. CONCLUSIONS: \u03C9-3 vs. \u03C9-6 lipid emulsions differentially influence the plasma free fatty acid profile with impact on neutrophil functions. Lipid-based parenteral nutrition in septic patients may thus exert profound influence on sequelae and status of immunocompetence and inflammation.

AE37 primarily elicits a CD4\u002B response while GP2 elicits a CD8\u002B response against the HER2 antigen. These peptides were tested in a large randomized trial to assess their ability to prevent recurrence in HER2 expressing breast cancer patients. The primary analyses found no difference in 5-year overall disease-free survival (DFS) but possible benefit in subgroups. Here, we present the final landmark analysis. METHODS: In this 4-arm, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center phase II trial, disease-free node positive and high-risk node negative breast cancer patients enrolled after standard of care therapy. Six monthly inoculations of vaccine (VG) vs. control (CG) were given as the primary vaccine series with 4 boosters at 6-month intervals. Demographic, safety, immunologic, and DFS data were evaluated. RESULTS: 456 patients were enrolled; 154 patients in the VG and 147 in CG for AE37, 89 patients in the VG and 91 in CG for GP2. The AE37 arm had no difference in DFS as compared to CG, but pre-specified exploratory subgroup analyses showed a trend towards benefit in advanced stage (p = 0.132, HR 0.573 CI 0.275\u20131.193), HER2 under-expression (p = 0.181, HR 0.756 CI 0.499\u20131.145), and triple-negative breast cancer (p = 0.266, HR 0.443 CI 0.114\u20131.717). In patients with both HER2 under-expression and advanced stage, there was significant benefit in the VG (p = 0.039, HR 0.375 CI 0.142\u20130.988) as compared to CG. The GP2 arm had no significant difference in DFS as compared to CG, but on subgroup analysis, HER2 positive patients had no recurrences with a trend toward improved DFS (p = 0.052) in VG as compared to CG. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II trial reveals that AE37 and GP2 are safe and possibly associated with improved clinical outcomes of DFS in certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. With these findings, further evaluations are warranted of AE37 and GP2 vaccines given in combination and/or separately for specific subsets of breast cancer patients based on their disease biology.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, Tommy A.; Mittendorf, Elizabeth A.; Hale, Diane F.; Myers, John W.; Peace, Kaitlin M.; Jackson, Doreen O.; Greene, Julia M.; Vreeland, Timothy J.; Clifton, G.

Many cardiovascular and hepatobiliary procedures result in massive hemorrhage and postpartum hemorrhage events in labor and delivery place the patient at a high risk for mortality. Gastrointestinal bleeding from diverticulosis, varices, and ulcer disease can result in significant blood loss requiring massive transfusion and resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. Timely and effective transfusion of blood products is of critical in these scenarios. The frequency in which blood component products are transfused in surgical patients begs for a greater understanding of them. The aim of this chapter is to provide clinicians with a discussion of the current literature on the various blood component products, their indications, and unique hemostatic conditions in the surgical patient. While the majority of data concerning optimal management of acquired coagulopathy and hemorrhagic shock resuscitation is based on trauma patients, many of the principles can and should be applied to the surgical patient (or likely any patient) with profound hemorrhage.","publish_time":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Streiff, Agathe; Cotton, Bryan A.","journal":"Common Problems in Acute Care Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8576648bca15f349295cf63efe0199da851d9ac2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["massive hemorrhage","various blood component products","effective transfusion of blood products","surgical patients","profound hemorrhage","massive transfusion","significant blood loss","postpartum hemorrhage events","hemorrhagic shock resuscitation","trauma patients","indications","coagulopathy","current literature","delivery","labor","optimal management","ulcer disease","unique hemostatic conditions","diverticulosis","varices","hepatobiliary procedures","leading cause of intraoperative deaths","majority of data","high risk","clinicians","Gastrointestinal bleeding","discussion","mortality","greater understanding","frequency","chapter","principles","scenarios","aim"],"language":"en"},

Medical management is critical to actualizing the individual or family\u2019s intent to donate and maximizing the benefit of that intent. This interval of care in the PICU begins with brain death and consent to donation and culminates with surgical organ procurement. During this phase, risks for hemodynamic instability and compromise of end organ function are high. The brain dead organ donor is in a distinct and challenging pathophysiologic condition that culminates in multifactorial shock. The potential benefits of aggressive medical management of the organ donor may include increased number of donors providing transplantable organs and increased number of organs transplanted per donor. This may improve graft function, graft survival, and patient survival in those transplanted. In this chapter, pathophysiologic changes occurring after brain death are reviewed. General and organ specific donor management strategies and logistic considerations are discussed. There is a significant opportunity for enhancing donor multi-organ function and improving organ utilization with appropriate PICU management.","publish_time":"2014-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shemie, Sam D.; Dhanani, Sonny","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1934e80e618ec2cf3f3ce35692a41fb37e1ad449.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential organ donor","brain dead organ donor","organ utilization","donor multi-organ function","organ specific donor management strategies","Brain death","surgical organ procurement","compromise of end organ function","appropriate PICU management","graft function","potential benefits of aggressive medical management","increased number of organs","pathophysiologic changes","graft survival","increased number of donors","transplantable organs","patient survival","family\u2019s intent","challenging pathophysiologic condition","complex physiologic changes","hemodynamic instability","donation","logistic considerations","consent","significant opportunity","risks","individual","multifactorial shock","phase","chapter","interval of care"],"language":"en"},

In fact, spontaneous behavioral changes could develop as a defensive response during the spread of an epidemic, thereby impacting the epidemic dynamics and affecting timing and overall number of cases. In this chapter, a model coupling the classic SIR disease transmission model with an imitation dynamics process is introduced which accounts for the diffusion of different behaviors in the population as a response to the epidemic threat. A detailed analysis of the model identifies the main determinants leading to remarkable alterations in infection dynamics in both risk perception and diffusion of human behavioral patterns.

Their enormous prevalence also indicates that rigorous research should be undertaken in order to tackle them, in both the prevention and treatment field.","publish_time":"2017-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guibas, George V.; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.","journal":"Viral Infections in Children, Volume II","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59bc072f4c7227212dcb6fcd99e24233aa1f3f2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["upper respiratory infections","upper respiratory system","enormous prevalence","enormous healthcare resource utilization","self-limiting nature","financial burden","variable families","asthma attacks","form","local complications","rigorous research","common sites of infection","adults","significant sequelae","prevention","treatment field","morbidity","order","viruses","children"],"language":"en"},

Some of these microbes persist by slowing the activity of the vitamin D receptor nuclear receptor, affecting the expression of endogenous antimicrobials and other key components of the innate immune system. It seems that bacteria that cause autoimmune disease accumulate over a lifetime, with individuals picking up pathogens with greater ease over time, as the immune response becomes increasingly compromised. Any one autoimmune disease is likely due to many different microbes within the metagenomic microbiota. This helps explain the high levels of comorbidity observed among patients with autoimmune conditions. What are commonly believed to be autoantibodies may instead be created in response to this metagenomic microbiota when the adaptive immune system is forced to deal with disintegration of infected cells. Similarly, haplotypes associated with autoimmune conditions vary widely among individuals and populations. They are more suggestive of a regional infectious model rather than a model in which an illness is caused by inherited variation of HLA haplotypes","publish_time":"2010-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Proal, Amy D.; Albert, Paul J.; Marshall, Trevor G.","journal":"Metagenomics of the Human Body","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eae038c87d2ad3a8c2bdb433830ec1667e16983d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121718.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autoimmune conditions","different microbes","billions of microbes","immune response","human body","prevailing theory of autoimmune disease","human genome","innate immune system","adaptive immune system","metagenomic microbiota","individuals","autoantibodies","number of microbes capable of persisting","advent of culture","vitamin D receptor nuclear receptor","culture-based methods","regional infectious model","inherited variation of HLA haplotypes","key components","pathogens","expression of endogenous antimicrobials","activity","patients","independent tools","concert","greater ease","collective genomes","lifetime","high levels of comorbidity","illness","era","Homo sapiens","disintegration of infected cells","Thanks","self","populations","bacteria","isolation"],"language":"en"},

These efforts, in turn, are grounded in renewed and tangible support from Universal Health Coverage and Primary Health Care, asset-based community health development, and better insights into what drives (health) equity and economic development. In describing these elements of policy development for value-based Healthy Cities the chapter also gives a firm argument for a broad range of stakeholders to engage successfully in longer term policy change.","publish_time":"2016-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Leeuw, Evelyne","journal":"Healthy Cities","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae44d18db329dcaab43097add675b017bd4597af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121840.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Universal Health Coverage and Primary Health Care"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health high","implementation of Health","elements of policy development","asset-based community health development","economic development","Primary Health Care","Universal Health Coverage","Healthy Cities","policy diffusion","longer term policy change","chapter","conditions","Healthy City vision","project-based work","longer term perspectives","better insights","social justice","global commitments","better understanding of complex systems","developments","tangible support","political agendas","deployment","firm argument","drives","number of glocal","emphases","broad range of stakeholders","lasting programme","approaches","equity","values","key barrier","turn","Policies","definition of projectitis","projectism","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Viral infections are known for inflicting colossal economic losses worldwide in food/work/companion animals. During the last few decades, emergence of a number of new viral diseases in animals, humans and plants has been visualized. Animal disease surveillance and monitoring is essential for the sustainability of healthy livestock production systems internationally. Preparedness for combating the emerging, re-emerging, exotic and transboundary diseases requires comprehensive monitoring and precision detection systems that are pliable under the field situations. With collective and concerted scientific interventions, a few of the animal viral diseases have been stamped out globally or regionally. Rinderpest, popularly called cattle plague, was eradicated from India in 2006 and globally in 2011. Notably, India achieved the disease-free status by OIE in 2014 for African horse sickness (peste equine), a deadly viral disease of equines. Likewise, equine infectious anaemia (EIA) and equine influenza (EI) have been controlled to a greater extent in India by adopting surveillance and monitoring along with zoo sanitary measures. Overall, there is a need for developing the \u2018One World, One Health\u2019 concept using multidisciplinary, regional and international networking to control major economically important emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases of humans and animals. This chapter describes various strategies for combating viral diseases of livestock.","publish_time":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar; Malik, Yashpal Singh","journal":"Recent Advances in Animal Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e00ab1ff9e72c8cdbccf3842b571eec260355675.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121847/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OIE"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["viral diseases of livestock","animal viral diseases","Viral infections","number of new viral diseases","transboundary diseases","infectious diseases of humans","India","deadly viral disease of equines","Animal disease surveillance","peste equine","equine infectious anaemia","equine influenza","comprehensive monitoring","plants","companion animals","re-emerging","field situations","sustainability of healthy livestock production systems","precision detection systems","fascinating field of virology","international networking","OIE","food","EIA","African horse sickness","concept","colossal economic losses","various strategies","concerted scientific interventions","emergence","disease-free status","World","cattle plague","chapter","greater extent","zoo sanitary measures","aided mankind","Rinderpest","decades","Preparedness","report","need"],"language":"en"},

More precisely, we look at what concepts are used, how they are used (implemented), and what kind of validation procedures can be applied.","publish_time":"2011-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alam, Shah Jamal; Geller, Armando","journal":"Agent-Based Models of Geographical Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a86c98c18ebf5cf65c6bf56db299b263d1524b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121994.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121994/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social patterns","social simulation","Social network analysis","agent-based models","Computational social science","particular agent","role of agent","based modeling","individual interactions","generative-analytical","momentum","kinds","popularity","kind of validation procedures","academic community","relationships","symbiosis","chapter","concepts"],"language":"en"},

Two other family members, SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9, cleave regulator proteins involved in cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis at nonbasic peptide bonds. Furin is ubiquitous in eukaryotic tissues and cells. PACE4, PC5, and PC7 are also widespread, whereas the expression of the other PCs is more restricted. PCs are synthesized as multi-segmented zymogens which are autocatalytically activated. The prodomains have regulatory and inhibitory functions. The catalytic domains are the most conserved domains among the PCs. The architecture of the catalytic active furin domain is known in different binding states. The C-terminal parts of the PCs differ in length and structure and contain encoded peptide signatures guiding the PCs to the subcellular destinations on the secretory pathways: SKI-1/S1P to the cis-Golgi, furin, PC5B, and PC7 to the TGN region but also to the plasma membrane. PACE4, PC5A, and PCSK9 are attached at the cell surface. Truncated, soluble furin and SKI-1/S1P, as well as PC1 and PC2, are released into the extracellular matrix. Many enveloped viruses are activated by furin and furin-like PCs and arenaviruses and a few bunyaviruses by SKI-1/S1P. The PCs cleave the viral fusion glycoprotein to trigger fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes to deliver the viral genome into host cells. Cleavage by PCs, occasionally in concert with other endoproteases, enables conformational changes in the viral membrane proteins needed for correct oligomerization of glycoprotein spikes and their effective incorporation into virions. Mutational alterations of PC cleavage sites can reduce the fusion potential of viral surface proteins and thus facilitate the development of secure live attenuated vaccines. Alternatively, agents preventing cleavage of viral surface (glyco)proteins block fusion capacity and multicyclic virus replications. PC inhibitors are suggested as promising antiviral drugs for quite a number of viruses causing severe infections.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garten, Wolfgang","journal":"Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d665082faa0a4f72544cb56cc9c603d4666ac35a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Proprotein"],"organizations":["TGN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral membrane proteins","viral fusion glycoprotein","fusion potential of viral surface proteins","cleavage of viral surface","soluble furin","SKI","S1P","fusion of viral envelopes","regulator proteins","bioactive proteins","viral genome","proteins block fusion capacity","PC7","PACE4","catalytic active furin domain","cleaving precursor proteins","cell surface","PCSK9","PC2","catalytic domains","PC1","Mutational alterations of PC cleavage sites","number of viruses","PC inhibitors","plasma membrane","eukaryotic tissues","conserved domains","eukaryotic subtilases","host cells","enveloped viruses","nonbasic peptide bonds","encoded peptide signatures","correct oligomerization of glycoprotein spikes","fatty acid homeostasis","growth factors","cholesterol","cellular membranes","multicyclic virus replications","conformational changes","receptors","promising antiviral drugs","hormones","PC4","subcellular destinations","length","structure","PC5B","PC6","group of serine proteases","effective incorporation","multibasic motifs","secretory pathways","development of secure live attenuated vaccines","LPC","different binding states","PC3","TGN region","peptides","architecture","PC8","concert","cis-Golgi","bunyaviruses","arenaviruses","C-terminal parts","prodomains","inhibitory functions","virions","endoproteases","severe infections","multi-segmented zymogens","agents","family members","PC5A","Proprotein convertases","expression","extracellular matrix"],"language":"en"},

The risk of SARS reemergence in humans remains high due to the large animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-like coronavirus and the genome instability of RNA coronaviruses. An epidemic in 2003 affected more than 8,000 patients in 29 countries, with 10% mortality. SARS infection is transmitted by air droplets. Clinical and laboratory manifestations include fever, chills, rigor, myalgia, malaise, diarrhea, cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase activities. Health care workers are a high-risk group, and advanced age is strongly associated with disease severity. Treatment has been empirical, and there is no licensed SARS vaccine for humans so far. However, presence of long-lived neutralizing antibodies and memory T- and B-lymphocytes in convalescent SARS patients raises hope for active immunization. Furthermore, results from preclinical SARS vaccines expressing spike protein to elicit neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses that are protective in mouse and nonhuman primate models are encouraging. Very little is known of the early events in viral clearance and the onset of innate and inflammatory responses during the SARS infection. Regulation of the innate immune response is associated with the development of adaptive immunity and disease severity in SARS infection. Notably, SARS-CoV has evolved evasive strategies to suppress antiviral type I interferon responses in infected cells. In addition, inflammatory responses are characterized by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, IP-10, and MCP-1 in tissues and serum, and massive infiltrations of inflammatory cells such as macrophages in infected tissues. Due to the lack of animal models that mimic the clinical manifestations of human SARS infection for mechanistic study and vaccine evaluation, development of a safe prophylactic SARS vaccine for human use remains a huge challenge. This chapter is written to summarize and highlight the latest clinical, serological, and immunological parameters relevant to the pathogenesis and protective immunity of SARS infection in humans.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chris Ka-fai; Xu, Xiaoning","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88d2540f6722a38897471e7fd766af7904c786c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","licensed SARS vaccine","protective immunity of SARS infection","convalescent SARS patients","preclinical SARS vaccines","risk of SARS reemergence","clinical manifestations of human SARS infection","large animal reservoirs of SARS","safe prophylactic SARS vaccine","inflammatory responses","humans","interferon responses","cellular responses","disease severity","vaccine evaluation","infected cells","infectious disease","unknown animal reservoirs","infected tissues","lack of animal models","massive infiltrations of inflammatory cells","development of adaptive immunity","human use","presence of long-lived neutralizing antibodies","laboratory manifestations","onset of innate","novel zoonotic coronavirus","innate immune response","nonhuman primate models","elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase","alanine aminotransferase","mechanistic study","thrombocytopenia","memory T","spike protein","B-lymphocytes","pathogenesis","antiviral type","high-risk group","cough","dyspnoea","diarrhea","pneumonia","malaise","myalgia","chills","neutrophilia","rigor","immunological parameters relevant","fever","mouse","evasive strategies","lymphopenia","viral clearance","macrophages","upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines","advanced age","creatine kinase activities","active immunization","chemokines","Health care workers","genome instability of RNA coronaviruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome","results","early events","huge challenge","MCP","air droplets","IP","countries","addition","Treatment","mortality","epidemic","chapter"],"language":"en"},

In many respects bats make ideal reservoir hosts for viruses: they are the only mammals that fly, thus assisting in virus dispersal; they roost in large numbers, thus aiding transmission cycles; some bats hibernate over winter, thus providing a mechanism for viruses to persist between seasons; and genetic factors may play a role in the ability of bats to host viruses without resulting in clinical disease. Within the broad diversity of viruses found in bats are some important neurological pathogens, including rabies and other lyssaviruses, and Hendra and Nipah viruses, two recently described viruses that have been placed in a new genus, Henipaviruses in the family Paramyxoviridae. In addition, bats can also act as alternative hosts for the flaviviruses Japanese encephalitis and St Louis encephalitis viruses, two important mosquito-borne encephalitogenic viruses, and bats can assist in the dispersal and over-wintering of these viruses. Bats are also the reservoir hosts of progenitors of SARS and MERS coronaviruses, although other animals act as spillover hosts.

While the field of pediatric emergency medicine is much broader, we have chosen some key topics which are essential for every physician providing care to children. The resuscitation section highlights the challenges and the particularities of pediatric airway management as well as the correct technique for effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation and vascular access. The sepsis section stresses that the key to a successful outcome is early recognition; it outlines the clinical spectrum of sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response and the pathophysiology of septic shock, with emphasis on early clinical signs, airway management, volume resuscitation, vasoactive support and antibiotic therapy. In the last decade, attention to pediatric pain management has resulted in increasing awareness of assessment tools and pharmacologic as well as non-pharmacologic strategies for pain control and anxiolysis. The pain section updates these important aspects of pediatric care and includes management of procedural sedation. Although the general principles of trauma care in children are similar to those of adults, the trauma section highlights the key differences, with respect to anatomy and physiology, and how these impact on early recognition of hemorrhagic shock, susceptibility to specific injuries, indications for imaging (no pan-CTs!) and the more prevalent non-surgical management. Healthcare providers must also know how to safely transport a child who requires additional resources or an escalation in level of care. The regionalization of pediatric intensive care units and trauma services has made it imperative for pediatricians to understand the general principles of transport medicine outlined in this chapter. The overview of pediatric inter-facility transport discusses choice of transport team and modality, emphasizes patient stabilization prior to transport and outlines required medications and supplies.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Principi, Tania; Schonfeld, Deborah; Weingarten, Laura; Schneeweiss, Suzan; Rosenfield, Daniel; Ernst, Genevieve; Schuh, Suzanne; Scolnik, Dennis","journal":"Update in Pediatrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf0f37115844c87f3ebf66eb8075b42a45b16e98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric pain management","important aspects of pediatric care","particularities of pediatric airway management","critical aspects of pediatric emergency care","resuscitation section","level of care","trauma section","pain section","general principles of trauma care","regionalization of pediatric intensive care units","overview of pediatric inter-facility transport","field of pediatric emergency medicine","general principles of transport medicine","choice of transport team","management of procedural sedation","sepsis section stresses","prevalent non-surgical management","volume resuscitation","early clinical signs","early recognition of hemorrhagic shock","trauma services","key differences","pain control","key topics","children","outlines","chapter","effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation","non-pharmacologic strategies","clinical spectrum of sepsis","pathophysiology of septic shock","susceptibility","emphasis","vasoactive support","specific injuries","defibrillation","systemic inflammatory response","patient stabilization","correct technique","modality","increasing awareness of assessment tools","imaging","indications","impact","challenges","vascular access","antibiotic therapy","state-of-the-art approach","successful outcome","additional resources","respect","anatomy","pediatricians","escalation","anxiolysis","medications","physician","adults","decade","attention","supplies","pan-CTs","Healthcare providers"],"language":"en"},

The polyesters, the polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), are the most extensively studied polymers in regard to their use in display technology. The material properties of bacterial PHAs in combination with their biocompatibility and biodegradability make them attractive substrates for use in display technology applications. By translationally fusing bioactive molecules to a gene encoding a PHA-binding domain, the appropriate functionalization for a given application can be achieved such that the need for chemical immobilization is circumvented. By separately extracting and processing the biopolymer, using it to coat a surface, and then treating this surface with the fusion proteins, surface functionalization for immunodiagnostic microarray or tissue engineering applications can be accomplished. Conversely, by expressing the fusion protein directly in the PHA-producing organisms, one-step production of functionalized beads can be achieved. Such beads have been demonstrated in diverse applications, including fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, microarrays, diagnostic skin test for tuberculosis, vaccines, protein purification, and affinity bioseparation.","publish_time":"2017-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rehm, Fabian B.

Key to understanding their function is recognition of their pleiotropism and often overlapping and functional redundancies. Classified here into 9 main families, most of the 23 approved cytokine preparations (19 different cytokines and 4 pegylated), all in recombinant human (rh) form, are grouped in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor \u03B2 (TGF\u03B2) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines are aldesleukin (rhIL-2), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rhG-CSF), sargramostim (rhGM-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin), ancestim (rh-SCF), and the rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoetin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is in the IL-1 family; recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin (rhKGF) and becaplermin (rhPDGF) are in the PDGF family; and rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGF\u03B2 family. The main physicochemical features, FDA-approved indications, modes of action and side effects of these approved cytokines are presented. Underlying each adverse events profile is their pleiotropism, potency and capacity to release other cytokines producing cytokine \u201Ccocktails.\u201D Side effects, some serious, occur despite cytokines being endogenous proteins, and this therefore demands caution in attempts to introduce individual members into the clinic.

Direct contacts represent the most obvious opportunities for a signal to be transmitted. However, because signals that persist after being deposited into the environment may later be acquired by other group members, indirect environmentally-mediated transmission is also possible. To date, studies of signal transmission within groups have focused on direct physical interactions and ignored the role of indirect pathways. Here, we use an agent-based model to study how the movement of individuals and characteristics of the signal being transmitted modulate transmission. By analysing the dynamic interaction networks generated from these simulations, we show that the addition of indirect pathways speeds up signal transmission, while the addition of physically-realistic collisions between individuals in densely packed environments hampers it. Furthermore, the inclusion of spatial biases that induce the formation of individual territories, reveals the existence of a trade-off such that optimal signal transmission at the group level is only achieved when territories are of intermediate sizes. Our findings provide insight into the selective pressures guiding the evolution of behavioural traits in natural groups, and offer a means by which multi-agent systems can be engineered to achieve desired transmission capabilities.","publish_time":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gorochowski, Thomas E.; Richardson, Thomas O.","journal":"Temporal Network Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5cd67586cce346312cd5671aaae441227983075.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal signal transmission","studies of signal transmission","mediated transmission","desired transmission capabilities","movement of individuals","addition of indirect pathways","natural groups","formation of physical interaction networks","role of indirect pathways","signals","direct physical interactions","formation of individual territories","dynamic interaction networks","group level","group members","Direct contacts","multi-agent systems","agent-based model","evolution of behavioural traits","selective pressures","means","realistic collisions","existence","simulations","obvious opportunities","trade-off","packed environments","findings","insight","inclusion of spatial biases","date","characteristics","information","intermediate sizes","disease"],"language":"en"},

Among all, porcine teschoviruses (PTVs) are of high prominence leading to clinical illness and consequent economic loss to the livestock sector. These are associated with extremely lethal non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis (Teschen disease) and are distributed world over. Its milder form, Talfan disease, inflicts low morbidity and mortality and general clinical disease. The first epizootics of Teschen disease occurred in 1929 in the Czech Republic. Mature virions are small (23\u201330 nm) and stable in environmental conditions (pH range 2\u20139, heat, lipid solvents). Genetic variations in the major surface protein, VP1, lead to the evolution of several new types. As of now, 13 genotypes in PTV are approved, namely PTV-1\u201313. Among all, PTV-1 is highly virulent and causes severe mortality and morbidity in the porcine population, domestic as well as wild. Ingestion is the main spreading route of infection, though intra-nasal infection and virus secretion in the urine are also noted. Along with encephalitis, PTVs are also responsible for reproductive disorders, diarrhoea, pneumonia, pericarditis and myocarditis. PTVs are also found as co-infection with several bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. Several conventional and modern diagnostics tools are available for their detection. Alternative of serological typing, VP1 and VP2 gene-based molecular typing is now preferred to know the epidemiological pattern. Although initially vaccines were used for its eradication in Europe, due to the sporadic reports of mild PTV infection in several countries, the approach was discontinued. Moreover, due to the presence of multiple serotypes, developing a multivalent PTV vaccine to protect against all strains is a major challenge.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malik, Yashpal Singh; Bhat, Sudipta; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Wang, Fun-In; Touil, Nadia; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar","journal":"Emerging and Transboundary Animal Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eea99edd3e46e56abb812a2b60448ce72dbe1270.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123469.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTV"],"locations":["Czech Republic","Europe"],"keyphrases":["PTVs","co-infection","Talfan disease","porcine population","porcine teschoviruses","sporadic reports of mild PTV infection","general clinical disease","epizootics of Teschen disease","multivalent PTV vaccine","intra-nasal infection","VP1","main spreading route of infection","low morbidity","clinical illness","severe mortality","molecular typing","parasitic pathogens","major challenge","emerging pathogens","major surface protein","Alternative of serological typing","consequent economic loss","diarrhoea","lead","VP2 gene","reproductive disorders","pH range","environmental conditions","pneumonia","virus secretion","lethal non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis","high prominence","modern diagnostics tools","family Picornaviridae","heat","pericarditis","livestock sector","evolution","Genetic variations","strains","countries","presence of multiple serotypes","milder form","Europe","detection","myocarditis","Ingestion","urine","distributed world","new types","eradication","Mature virions","lipid solvents","encephalitis","approach","Czech Republic","epidemiological pattern","vaccines","genotypes"],"language":"en"},

They are known to reside within endo-lysosomes where they acquire optimal conditions for proteolytic activity and substrate cleavage. However, cathepsins have been detected in locations other than the canonical compartments of the endocytotic pathway. They are often secreted from cells in either proteolytically inactive proform or as mature and active enzyme; this may happen in both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, cytosolic and nuclear forms of cathepsins have been described and are currently an emerging field of research aiming at understanding their functions in such unexpected cellular locations. This chapter summarizes the canonical pathways of biosynthesis and transport of cathepsins in healthy cells. We further describe how cathepsins can reach unexpected locations such as the extracellular space or the cytosol and the nuclear matrix. No matter where viruses and cathepsins encounter, several outcomes can be perceived. Thus, scenarios are discussed on how cathepsins may support virus entry into host cells, involve in viral fusion factor and polyprotein processing in different host cell compartments, or help in packaging of viral particles during maturation. It is of note to mention that this review is not meant to comprehensively cover the present literature on viruses encountering cathepsins but rather illustrates, on some representative examples, the possible roles of cathepsins in replication of viruses and in the course of disease.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brix, Klaudia","journal":"Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8667b1552dbf2a6633a1872a409dfc87d63c734.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transport of cathepsins","cathepsins encounter","nuclear forms of cathepsins","possible roles of cathepsins","host cells","unexpected locations","canonical compartments","replication of viruses","healthy cells","unexpected cellular locations","different host cell compartments","optimal conditions","proteolytic activity","proteolytic enzymes","pathological conditions","nuclear matrix","viral fusion factor","canonical pathways of biosynthesis","packaging of viral particles","polyprotein processing","proteolytically inactive proform","substrate cleavage","extracellular space","cytosol","broad spectrum of substrates","functions","virus entry","active enzyme","representative examples","maturation","chapter","endocytotic pathway","present literature","matter","outcomes","endo-lysosomes","course of disease","emerging field of research","scenarios","review"],"language":"en"},

Molecular tests provide many advantages over traditional laboratory methods but, with the exception of a few analytes, are still largely in the developmental phase for gastrointestinal pathogens and are not widely used. The main advantages of molecular tests include increased sensitivity and the ability to detect agents which will not grow in culture. To test for all possible gastrointestinal pathogens at one time would require a large panel that would include a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. Challenges inherent in developing diagnostic molecular panels include ensuring that all variants of a particular microorganism can be detected as well as the rapid evolution of pathogens.

Bij ouderen vormen urineweginfecties een relatief frequente oorzaak van koorts. Bij ontbreken van richtinggevende voorgeschiedenis, klachten of verschijnselen volstaat men in eerste instantie met lichamelijk onderzoek van KNO-gebied en longen. Bij negatieve bevindingen volgt urineonderzoek. Wanneer geen afwijkingen gevonden worden, gaat men uit van een onschuldige virale oorzaak. Bij een ernstig zieke indruk of verminderd bewustzijn is het lichamelijk onderzoek allereerst gericht op eventuele stoornissen in de vitale functies, omdat deze onmiddellijke therapeutische implicaties hebben. Als de koorts een week aanhoudt of eerder bij verandering van het beeld, dient een uitgebreide anamnese en algemeen lichamelijk onderzoek plaats te vinden om diagnostische aanknopingspunten op te sporen. Ook kan de arts dan aanvullend onderzoek laten verrichten: in eerste instantie bloed-, urine- en fecesonderzoek en een X-thorax, eventueel gevolgd door X-sinussen en een mantoux-reactie. Medicatie wordt zo veel mogelijk gestaakt om een allergie aan te tonen of uit te sluiten. Na enkele dagen herhaalt men anamnese en lichamelijk onderzoek. Twee weken onbegrepen koorts is reden voor verdere (poli)klinische evaluatie. Concrete aanwijzingen op grond van steeds herhaalde anamnese en lichamelijk onderzoek zijn richtinggevend voor de inzet van complex aanvullend onderzoek. Dit bestaat onder meer uit bloedkweken, uitgebreider bloedonderzoek, leverbiopsie, beenmergpunctie en CT-scan buik en thorax.

Such biopsy has been requested specifically in the case of diffuse lung disease among patients receiving treatment for solid-organ or hematologic cancers, particularly when symptoms of respiratory failure progress and when noninvasive diagnostic tests and empiric treatments fail to halt progression. In such circumstances, radiologists, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons may be consulted and asked to provide tissue specimens that will allow rapid, accurate diagnosis leading to specific treatment.

High mutation rates, large population sizes, and short generation times contribute to their typically fast evolutionary rates. However, many additional processes operate on their genomes, often in opposite directions, driving their evolution and allowing them to adapt to diverse host populations and antiviral drugs. Until recently, the high levels of genetic variation of most viruses have been explored only at a few genes or genome regions. The recent advent and increasing affordability of next-generation sequencing techniques have allowed obtaining complete genome sequences of large numbers of viruses, mainly HIV, HCV, influenza A, and others associated with emerging infections, such as Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus. This opens the possibility to explore the effects of the different processes affecting viral diversity and evolution at the genome level. Consequently, population genomics provides the conceptual and empirical tools necessary to interpret genetic variation in viruses and its dynamics and drivers and to transform these results into information that may complement the epidemiological surveillance of the virus and its disease. This chapter provides an overview of human viruses from a population genomics perspective, with a special emphasis on RNA viruses, and the potential benefits of \u201Cgenomic surveillance\u201D to establish public health policies that improve the control and monitoring of the diseases caused by these viruses.","publish_time":"2018-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez-Candelas, Fernando; Pati\u00F1o-Galindo, Juan \u00C1ngel; Valiente-Mullor, Carlos","journal":"Population Genomics: Microorganisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e38b205e33d148d66be6d121042ab1b4c3249e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123750.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123750/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","overview of human viruses","complete genome sequences of large numbers of viruses","large population sizes","population genomics perspective","human health","genome level","genome regions","high levels of genetic variation","High mutation rates","genomic surveillance","epidemiological surveillance","different processes","dengue virus","additional processes","generation sequencing techniques","short generation times","public health policies","fast evolutionary rates","empirical tools necessary","viral diversity","special emphasis","Zika","affordability","control","HIV","potential benefits","diverse host populations","antiviral drugs","genomes","chikungunya","effects","dynamics","greatest threats","monitoring","information","opposite directions","drivers","HCV","diseases","chapter","emerging infections","results","recent advent","influenza","genes","possibility"],"language":"en"},

Data are presented from a general practitioner morbidity surveillance system based in England and Wales. Each acute respiratory syndrome is described in respect of seasonality, secular trends and microbiological aetiology providing an insight into the complex nature of these acute respiratory episodes. The more serious endpoints of acute respiratory infections are hospitalisation and death. Many acute respiratory infections are mild in nature and generally self-limiting and therefore do not commonly require further medical interventions. However, despite major advances in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections in recent years, hospitalisation and deaths continue to exert pressures on national health resources and provide an economic burden in countries across the world on an annual basis.","publish_time":"2009-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elliot, Alex J.; Fleming, Douglas M.","journal":"Common Cold","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7d0d597be3b2724407a2891a9507b3a8458eac9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Wales"],"keyphrases":["common respiratory infections","treatment of acute respiratory infections","acute respiratory syndrome","acute respiratory episodes","serious endpoints of acute respiratory infections","mild infections","hospitalisation","common causes","complex nature","serious presentations","wide ranging","general practitioner morbidity surveillance system","recent years","respect of seasonality","prevention","economic burden","microbiological aetiology","secular trends","world","national health resources","England","pressures","insight","deaths","co-morbidities","countries","age","severity","confounding factors","patient","Wales","major advances","annual basis","range of symptoms","pneumonia","Data","chapter","medical interventions"],"language":"en"},

Undernutrition can also lead to poor health into adulthood, which affects social and economic development of nations. On the other end of the malnutrition spectrum, overweight and obesity are growing problems, linked to changing diets and activity patterns, which also lead to serious health problems and impact the economies of nations. This chapter attempts to unpack the importance of food and agriculture policies on nutrition outcomes and why engagement of food and public health systems remain critically important. External pressures, such as climate variability and population growth, that tax these systems are discussed, as well as the globalization of our food system and why that has shifted dietary patterns and nutrition and health status trends. The multi-sectoral integration of food and health systems and its importance to improve nutrition is demonstrated through three models. Three very brief case studies are presented that help exemplify some of the food and health system trends that influence policy and ultimately, nutrition outcomes.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fanzo, Jessica","journal":"International Food Law and Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40903d55891ffd3c640515e4bdb2dd676718c7c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123872.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["poor health","importance of food","food system","public health systems","health system trends","engagement of food","food security","nutrition outcomes","health status trends","serious health problems","adequate health services","multi-sectoral integration of food","undernutrition","dietary patterns","increased morbidity","activity patterns","economies of nations","increased attention","economic development of nations","devastating multi-faceted problem","infants","young children","climate variability","sanitary environment","agriculture policies","population growth","proper care","policy","healthy life","malnutrition spectrum","practices","women","mortality","obesity","world","tax","help","adulthood","long-term disability","brief case studies","household members","External pressures","diets","globalization","chapter","models"],"language":"en"},

Endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria, with their pyrogenic component lipopolysaccaride, is the most potent exogenous pyrogen. Fever is also a common finding in children without obvious evidence of infection, for example hypersensitivity reaction, autoimmune diseases and malignancy. Exogenous pyrogens initiate fever by inducing host cells (primarily macrophages) to produce and release endogenous pyrogens such as interleukin-1, which has multiple biological functions essential for the immune response. Endogenous pyrogens are transmitted to the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre, specifically organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), where they induce synthesis of prostaglandins, of which PGE2 is the most important. These raise the thermostatic set point to initiate the febrile response. The hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre accomplishes heat production by inducing shivering and heat conservation through vasoconstriction. At an established degree, fever is regulated (even at a temperature of over 41.0 \u00B0C) and heat production approximates loss, as in health, though at a higher level of the set point. Therefore fever does not climb up relentlessly. In addition to the function as an endogenous pyrogen, IL-1 activates T-lymphocytes to produce various factors, such as INF and IL-2, which are vital for immune response. The production of fever simultaneously with lymphocyte activation constitutes the clearest and strongest evidence in favour of the protective role of fever. The induction of fever results in inhibition of bacterial growth, increased bactericidal effects of neutrophils, production of acute-phase protein synthesis and other physiological changes such as anorexia and somnolence. These changes suggest that fever has an adaptive role in the host\u2019s survival during infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Radhi, A.

With the increasing incidence with ageing, the full impact of these diseases is yet to be realised. For most chronic lung diseases there are limited treatments options, with the existing approaches mainly addressing symptom relief. Little progress has been made, in recent years, in the development of new therapeutic strategies for managing these burdensome pathologies. There is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these diseases. Endogenous progenitor cells (stem cells) have been recognised in many organs, including the lungs where they are suggested to maintain a population of cells that are able to facilitate the endogenous repair processes. Emerging knowledge of how these repair processes are disrupted in chronic lung diseases and the potential to capitalise upon the regenerative capacity of stem cell populations raise the hopes of the field worldwide for innovative treatment approaches for these devastating diseases in the future.

The cancer stem cells in the tumor have the capacity both to self-renew and differentiate to sustain the tumor. Features of cancer stem cells are described in this review, with an emphasis on the role that dietary phytochemicals may play in cancer chemoprevention. Ingredients in the diet can inhibit cancer cells and cancer stem cells. These compounds include curcumin from curry, epigallocatechin gallate from green tea, resveratrol from red wine, genistein from soy, sulforaphane from broccoli, and many others.

Epidemiological studies soon recognized that HBV is a global chronic liver disease, with the highest prevalence rates in Asia and Africa. HBV is highly infectious, and in most cases transmitted from family members. Infections acquired during the perinatal period have a 90% chance of progressing to persistent HBV infection. This rate decreases to 2.3% when infection occurs at college student age. The persistent HBV infection starts with the immune tolerance phase when our immune system may recognize HBV antigens, but does not produce significant inflammation. An immune clearance reaction may develop to terminate HBV replication two to four decades later. When this immune clearance reaction successfully suppresses HBV replication, HBsAg carriers may progress to the residual phase. About 50% of HBsAg carriers ultimately clear HBsAg at age 80. Those patients unable to clear HBV replication smoothly have increased risk of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinogenesis. Current therapies decrease hepatic decompensation and increase survival rate. However, the sustained virologic response rate is lower than 40%. About 50% of patients experience a clinical flare within one year after therapy ends.

However, transgene expression in certain cell types is sometimes not desirable, either because of toxicity, cell transformation, or induction of transgene-specific immune responses. In other cases, specific targeting of only cancerous cells within a tumor is sought after for the delivery of suicide genes. Consequently, great effort has been invested in developing strategies to control transgene delivery/expression in a cell/tissue-specific manner. These strategies can broadly be divided in three; particle pseudotyping (surface targeting), which entails modification of the envelope glycoprotein (ENV); transcriptional targeting, which utilizes cell-specific promoters and/or inducible promoters; and posttranscriptional targeting, recently applied in lentivectors by introducing sequence targets for cell-specific microRNAs. In this chapter we describe each of these strategies providing some illustrative examples.","publish_time":"2012-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Escors, David; Kochan, Grazyna; Stephenson, Holly; Breckpot, Karine","journal":"Lentiviral Vectors and Gene Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/423249636f894f5013ed5cd42a209b5279ab8291.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122860/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-specific promoters","specific targeting","cell-specific microRNAs","cell transformation","certain cell types","cell cycle stage","wide range of cell types","transgene expression","transgene delivery","surface targeting","posttranscriptional targeting","specific immune responses","tissue-specific manner","induction of transgene","lentivectors","developing strategies","inducible promoters","delivery of suicide genes","modification","sequence targets","envelope glycoprotein","cancerous cells","capacity","toxicity","tumor","particle pseudotyping","cases","great effort","main advantages","illustrative examples","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Responses often come through reallocation of resources from one disease control effort to a new pressing need. The operating models of preparedness and response are ill-equipped to prevent or ameliorate disease emergence or reemergence at global scales. Epidemiological challenges that are a threat to the economic stability of many regions of the world, particularly those depending on travel and trade, remain at the forefront of the Global Commons. Consequently, efforts to quantify the impact of mobility and trade on disease dynamics have dominated the interests of theoreticians for some time. Our experience includes an H1N1 influenza pandemic crisscrossing the world during 2009 and 2010, the 2014 Ebola outbreaks, limited to regions of West Africa lacking appropriate medical facilities, health infrastructure, and sufficient levels of preparedness and education, and the expanding Zika outbreaks, moving expeditiously across habitats suitable for Aedes aegypti. These provide opportunities to quantify the impact of disease emergence or reemergence on the decisions that individuals take in response to real or perceived disease risks. The case of SARS 2003 in 2003, the efforts to reduce the burden of H1N1 influenza cases in 2009, and the challenges faced in reducing the number of Ebola cases in 2014 are the three recent scenarios that required a timely global response. Studies addressing the impact of centralized sources of information, the impact of information along social connections, or the role of past disease outbreak experiences on the risk-aversion decisions that individuals undertake may help identify and quantify the role of human responses to disease dynamics while recognizing the importance of assessing the timing of disease emergence and reemergence. The co-evolving human responses to disease dynamics are prototypical of the feedbacks that define complex adaptive systems.

Clinically, HLH/MAS is a life-threatening condition that is usually diagnosed among febrile hospitalized patients (children and adults) who commonly present with unremitting fever and a shock-like multiorgan dysfunction scenario. Laboratory studies reveal pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP), hyperferritinemia, and features of coagulopathy. In about 60% of cases, excess hemophagocytosis (macrophages/histiocytes engulfing other hematopoietic cell types) is noted on biopsy specimens from the bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and other organs. HLH/MAS has been hypothesized to occur when a threshold level of inflammation has been achieved, and genetic and environmental risk factors are believed to contribute to the hyperinflammatory state. A broad variety of infections, from viruses to fungi to bacteria, have been identified as triggers of HLH/MAS, either in isolation or in addition to an underlying inflammatory disease state. Certain infections, particularly by members of the herpesvirus family, are the most notorious triggers of HLH/MAS.

They can potentially serve as the cloud condensation and ice nuclei (CCN and IN). Their role in global carbon cycle further highlights importance of studying their variability to link up with climate relevance parameters. Focusing on tropical region reveals that it holds wealthy number of human population and has massive vegetation cover-area. From Indian region, production estimates of bioaerosols from human population (current: ~1.25 billion; of which over 45% resides in Indo-Gangetic Plain: IGP) and Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks (100 in numbers, situated from north to south and east to west) is not known. Most of the forest fires in India occur during March\u2013June (hot and drier season). The detailed information on chemical composition, fingerprinting and radiative forcing from regional forest fires is also lacking. Unlike natural sources (forest cover and fires), the seasonal variability of pollutants emission characteristic and chemical, optical and radiative forcing are relatively well studied from anthropogenic biomass (post-harvest paddy- and wheat-residue and biofuels) burning emission in India. However, the abundance of bioaerosols and their variability over a large stretch of IGP (north-west to north-east) was not well documented. Towards this, we have undertaken a year-long campaign to study and document (first-attempt) bioaerosols variability over a complete annual cycle from central IGP. We observed a parallel enhancement in concentrations of fine-particulate matter (PM(2.5) in October\u2013November: 158 \u00B1 89 \u00B5g m(\u22123) as compared to June\u2013September months: 40 \u00B1 18 \u00B5g m(\u22123); two-tailed t = 8.2, p \u003C 0.05) and bioaerosols (particularly Gram-negative bacteria: GNB, a source of endotoxin in ambient air; 186 \u00B1 87 CFU/m(3) during October-November as compared to 114 \u00B1 58 CFU/m(3); t = 4.0, p \u003C 0.05) with the biomass burning emissions intensification period. The abundance of bioaerosols exhibits influence of ambient meteorology, for example GNB exhibited negative correlations with T, wind speed and heavy (\u003E4 mm daily) precipitation, whereas it showed positive correlations with RH and low precipitation amount (\u003C4 mm). Studying bioaerosols and establishing its linkage to health and climate appear to be of utmost importance.","publish_time":"2017-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajput, Prashant; Chauhan, Amit Singh; Gupta, Tarun","journal":"Environmental Contaminants","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b01268f7e1c062b0bbb7c7e6968db89f97cb08f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123097.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IGP","Wildlife Sanctuaries"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["bioaerosols variability","abundance of bioaerosols exhibits","production estimates of bioaerosols","forest cover","regional forest fires","radiative forcing","central IGP","tailed t","CFU","\u00B5g","seasonal variability of pollutants emission characteristic","large stretch of IGP","negative correlations","chemical composition","example GNB","positive correlations","wealthy number of human population","ambient meteorology","ambient air","anthropogenic biomass","Indian region","low precipitation","tropical region","utmost importance","complete annual cycle","global carbon cycle","climate relevance parameters","massive vegetation cover-area","post-harvest paddy","concentrations of fine","Wildlife Sanctuaries","wheat-residue","source of endotoxin","wind speed","particulate matter","National Parks","north","cloud condensation","ice nuclei","CCN","numbers","Indo-Gangetic Plain","biofuels","RH","document","Gram-negative bacteria","natural sources","attempt","parallel enhancement","east","west","PM","emissions intensification period","role","detailed information","particles of biological origin","linkage","health","year-long campaign","dead plants","animals","drier season","months"],"language":"en"},

While women and children (for example) are frequently represented in relation to risk, they are less likely to be presented as taking risks, and more likely to experience them.","publish_time":"2017-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zinn, Jens O.; McDonald, Daniel","journal":"Risk in The New York Times (1987-2014)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a65f03b50c805f68f660f6c4eb87ee3ce0284e4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123153.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123153/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["instantiation of risk","reporting","health","short risk hypes","increasing usage of risk words","scientific studies","strong references","epidemiological worldview","prominent topic","Infectious diseases","evidence","example","treatment","AIDS\u2019 long-term presence","study","social domains","civilisation illnesses","women","children","panic","relation","risks","trend"],"language":"en"},

Many theoretical advances occurred due to stochastic spreading models. Nevertheless, these stochastic models overlooked the influence of rational decisions on the outcome of the process. For instance, different levels of trust in acquaintances do play a role in information spreading, and actors may change their spreading decisions during the information diffusion process accordingly. Here, we study an information-spreading model in which the decision to transmit or not is based on trust. We explore the interplay between the propagation of information and the trust dynamics happening on a two-layer multiplex network. Actors\u0027 trustable or untrustable states are defined as accumulated cooperation or defection behaviors, respectively, in a Prisoner\u0027s Dilemma setup, and they are controlled by a memory span. The propagation of information is abstracted as a threshold model on the information-spreading layer, where the threshold depends on the trustability of agents. The analysis of the model is performed using a tree approximation and validated on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The results show that the memory of previous actions has a significant effect on the spreading of information. For example, the less memory that is considered, the higher is the diffusion. Information is highly promoted by the emergence of trustable acquaintances. These results provide insight into the effect of plausible biases on spreading dynamics in a multilevel networked system.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Hongrun; Arenas, Alex; G\u00F3mez, Sergio","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7196e846f97c1a93d9b833823a66c8d17bb4814b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spreading of information","propagation of information","spreading decisions","stochastic spreading models","prediction of information diffusion processes","trust dynamics","threshold model","stochastic models","memory span","results","memory of previous actions","different levels of trust","layer multiplex network","emergence of trustable acquaintances","significant effect","network theory","heterogeneous networks","Actors\u0027 trustable","influence of rational decisions","effect of plausible biases","major challenge","accumulated cooperation","untrustable states","implications","insight","outcome","understanding","role","defection behaviors","social sciences","tree approximation","theoretical advances","multilevel networked system","instance","Prisoner\u0027s Dilemma setup","trustability of agents","interplay","example","analysis"],"language":"en"},

In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS) simulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the thermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved. We analyze the standard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active configurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics returns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where the most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an absorbing state. We apply the methods to the contact process (CP) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models on regular and scale free networks. The investigated methods yield the same epidemic threshold for both models. For CP, that undergoes a standard collective phase transition, the methods are equivalent. For SIS, whose phase transition is ruled by the hub mutual reactivation, the SQS and HR methods are able to capture localized epidemic phases while RBC is not. We also apply the autocorrelation time as a tool to characterize the phase transition and observe that this analysis provides the same finite-size scaling exponents for the critical relaxation time for the investigated methods. Finally, we verify the equivalence between RBC method and a weak external field for epidemics on networks.","publish_time":"2016-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sander, Renan S.; Costa, Guilherme S.; Ferreira, Silvio C.","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0f73f8ac2961d475c2a318714ebb01419de8f0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217511.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217511/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIS","RBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["simulation methods","HR methods","investigated methods","RBC method","absorbing states","standard collective phase transition","finite size","SQS","hub reactivation","models","epidemic threshold","pre-absorbing configuration","steady state of epidemic processes","standard QS","CP","disease-free state","epidemics","visit","hub mutual reactivation","localized epidemic phases","scale free networks","finite-size scaling exponents","susceptible-infected","original dynamics","autocorrelation time","critical relaxation time","weak external field","different quasistationary","long times","active configurations","reflecting boundary condition","sampling","tool","contact process","analysis","thermodynamical limit","present work","equivalence","system","connected vertex","major hurdle"],"language":"en"},

Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections and cat-scratch disease (CSD) are the most frequent causes. Optimal treatment, which may include surgery, antibiotic treatment or wait-and-see approach, is debatable. The goal of this study was to compare the short- and long-term outcome of various surgical procedures. METHODS: Case series with a chart review of all children treated by surgical excision of granulomatous lymph nodes in the cervicofacial area from 2000 to 2016 at two tertiary care centers. RESULTS: Forty patients were included in this study. The median age at first symptoms was 3.7 years (13 months\u201314 years). Mean follow-up was 5.8 years (6 months\u201315.3 years). 25 patients fit with diagnosis of NTM infection, 6 with CSD while diagnosis remained uncertain in 9 patients. The primary surgical procedure consisted of total excision (n = 27), incision/drainage (n = 9) or incomplete excision (n = 4). None of the patients treated by primary complete excision needed further intervention contrary to the group of patients with incomplete surgical procedures where additional surgical management was required in 54%. At follow-up, all patients were healthy without evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSION: We advocate early surgical intervention with complete excision to reach quick resolution and reduce the need for additional surgery.

RESULTS: A total of 30 infants with median [interquartile range] gestational age of 27 weeks [25.7, 27.9] and birth weight of 930 g [780, 1090] were studied. Infants were extubated at 5 days [2, 13] of life with 973 g [880, 1170] and three failed (10%). No differences in cardiorespiratory behavior were noted, except for longer respiratory pauses (9.2 s [5.0, 11.5] vs. 7.3 s [4.6, 9.3]; p = 0.04) and higher FiO(2) levels (p = 0.02) during HFNC compared to NCPAP. CONCLUSIONS: In extremely preterm infants studied shortly after extubation, the use of HFNC was associated with longer respiratory pauses and higher FiO(2) requirements.","publish_time":"2019-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanbar, Lara J.; Shalish, Wissam; Latremouille, Samantha; Rao, Smita; Brown, Karen A.; Kearney, Robert E.; Sant\u2019Anna, Guilherme M.","journal":"Pediatr Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7bdcd100e05c80046811a56705772910a5812d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222114.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222114/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFNC","NCPAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NCPAP","preterm infants","HFNC features","higher FiO","use of HFNC","respiratory pauses","Respiratory signals","birth weight","differences","extubation attempt","modes of non-invasive respiratory support","oxygen saturation","cardiorespiratory physiology","cardiorespiratory behavior","fraction of inspired oxygen","high flow nasal cannula","Nasal continuous positive airway pressure","randomized crossover study","electrocardiogram","interquartile range","gestational age","abdominal movements","BACKGROUND","weeks","automated method","METHODS","changes","ribcage","total","levels","life","days","RESULTS","requirements","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Infections are frequently the etiologies underlying the respiratory, and occasionally cardiac, failure that necessitates ECLS. Just as importantly, infections are among the most commonly reported adverse events during ECLS. Infections in this setting may be the sequelae of prolonged critical illness or of underlying immune dysregulation; they may be hospital-acquired infections, and they may or may not be attributable to the presence of ECLS itself, the latter being an aspect that can be difficult to determine. Current registry data and evidence from the literature offer some insights, but also leave open many questions regarding the nature and significance of infections reported both before and during ECLS, including the question of any causal link between ECLS and the development of infections. An ongoing lack of consistency in the identification, diagnosis, management, and prevention of infections during ECLS is limiting our ability to interpret literature data and thus highlighting the need for more rigorous investigation and standardization of definitions. This review aims to characterize the current understanding of infections associated with the use of ECLS, taking into account data from the updated Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry, which provides important context for understanding the epidemiology and outcomes of these patients.

SOURCE: Search strategies were developed for MEDLINE, EMBASE, Joanna Briggs Institute, Cochrane, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. Eligible studies described the application of early cognitive interventions for delirium prevention or treatment within any intensive care setting. Study designs included randomized-controlled trials, quasi-experimental trials, and pre/post interventional trials. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four hundred and four citations were found. Seven full-text articles were included in the final review. Six of the included studies had an overall serious, high, or critical risk of bias. After application of cognitive intervention protocols, a significant reduction in delirium incidence, duration, occurrence, and development was found in four studies. Feasibility of cognitive interventions was measured in three studies. Cognitive stimulation techniques were described in the majority of studies. CONCLUSION: The study of early cognitive interventions in critically ill patients was identified in a small number of studies with limited sample sizes. An overall high risk of bias and variability within protocols limit the utility of the findings for widespread practice implications. This review may help to promote future large, multi-centre trials studying the addition of cognitive interventions to current delirium prevention practices. The need for robust data is essential to support the implementation of early cognitive interventions protocols.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deemer, Kirsten; Zjadewicz, Karolina; Fiest, Kirsten; Oviatt, Stephanie; Parsons, Michelle; Myhre, Brittany; Posadas-Calleja, Juan","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c4207ff81bd250e457a35b4b4e40f6c071fb0eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222136.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222136/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Joanna Briggs"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["addition of cognitive interventions","application of early cognitive interventions","study of early cognitive interventions","Feasibility of cognitive interventions","effects of early cognitive interventions","implementation of early cognitive interventions protocols","included studies","application of cognitive intervention protocols","majority of studies","Eligible studies","Cognitive stimulation techniques","small number of studies","delirium outcomes","delirium incidence","interventional trials","overall high risk of bias","critical risk of bias","current delirium prevention practices","randomized-controlled trials","quasi-experimental trials","multi-centre trials","ill patients","final review","systematic review","Cochrane methodology","Study designs","robust data","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","significant reduction","treatment","MEDLINE","Scopus","EMBASE","Joanna Briggs Institute","duration","variability","utility","limited sample sizes","intensive care setting","occurrence","widespread practice implications","Search strategies","need","CINAHL databases","literature","development","CONCLUSION","text articles","SOURCE","PURPOSE","reviewers","citations"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and Pediatric Neurology unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India involving children with PCR confirmed Influenza A (H1N1) with neurological manifestations during 2019 outbreak. RESULTS: Six children (5 females, 1 male) were enrolled. All presented with neurological symptoms (seizures and altered sensorium) accompanied with fever and respiratory symptoms with duration of illness of 2\u20137 d. The admission Glasgow Coma Scale ranged from 4 to 12. Only 2 cases showed cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Neuroimaging was suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema, acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. All were treated with Oseltamivir. Four cases had clinical features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and were managed in PICU, 3 of them needed mechanical ventilation, 3 needed vasoactive drugs, 3 received 3% saline infusion, 1 underwent invasive ICP monitoring, and 3 (cases 4, 5 and 6) received intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) for 5 d. Total duration of hospital stay was 10\u201330 d. Case 2 expired due to refractory raised ICP. Among survivors, 3 children had residual neurological deficits and the remaining 2 had achieved premorbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A (H1N1) can present with isolated or predominant neurological manifestations which can contribute to poor outcome.

Respiratory testing by PCR allows detection of human rhinovirus (HRV), but few data exist on the risk of concomitant BI in HRV-positive FI. METHODS: We identified well-appearing FI 1\u201390 days old within Intermountain Healthcare evaluated in the ED or inpatient setting (IP) with viral respiratory testing by PCR (RVPCR) from August 2007 to August 2016. Respiratory viruses detected by RVPCR included: adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A/B, parainfluenza 1\u20134, RSV and HRV. We used relative risk (RR) to compare the risk of BI for infants with HRV vs. non-HRV viruses detected. Similarly, we used RR to compare risk of UTI and invasive bacterial infection (IBI; bacteremia and meningitis) for infants with HRV detected compared with those who were virus negative. RESULTS: 10,964 FI were evaluated in the ED/IP during the study period. 4037 (37%) had RVPCR and were included. 2212 (55%) FI were positive for a respiratory virus and 73% were 29\u201390 days old. HRV was detected alone in 1392 (34%) and non-HRV viruses were detected in 820 (20%). The overall frequency of BI in the cohort was 9.5%. FI with HRV were more likely to have BI when compared with those with non-HRV viruses [7.8% vs 3.7% P \u003C 0.0001; RR 2.12 (95% CI; 1.43\u20133.15)]. When compared with virus-negative infants, HRV detection in infants 1\u201328 days did not decrease the risk for UTI [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.58\u20131.29)]; risk of IBI was statistically decreased [RR 0.41 (95% CI 0.19\u20130.88)] but with wide CI approaching 1 suggesting that this may not be clinically meaningful. Similarly, UTI risk in infants 29\u201390 days was statistically lower with HRV detection [RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.65\u20130.95)], but unlikely to be clinically important. For infants 29\u201390 days with HRV, risk of IBI was statistically decreased [RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34\u20130.80)] with possible clinical relevance. CONCLUSION: HRV detection was common in young febrile infants. Infants with HRV were at higher risk of BI than infants with non-HRV infection. Detection of HRV did not meaningfully change risk for UTI at any age or meaningfully impact risk of IBI in infants 1\u201328 days. HRV detection may be associated with a decreased risk for IBI in infants 29\u201390 days. DISCLOSURES: A. J.

We sought to determine whether a qualitative immunochromatographic assay (Alere\u2122 PBP2a Culture Colony test) that differentiates methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) from methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) could optimize time to appropriate therapy for patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) and nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. aureus. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to The Johns Hopkins Hospital with a respiratory or wound culture growing S. aureus between July-October 2015 (baseline period) and July-October 2016 (intervention period) were included. The primary outcome was time to optimal antibiotic therapy from specimen collection before and after implementation of the PBP2a assay. Secondary outcomes were (1) time to antibiotic de-escalation from specimen collection, (2) length of hospital stay, and (3) number of vancomycin levels. An unadjusted analysis was conducted using Chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. RESULTS: 189 patients met eligibility criteria (119 baseline, 70 intervention). There were no significant differences in characteristics of patients between periods. Overall time to optimal therapy decreased during the intervention period compared with baseline (IQR 0\u201324.7 hours vs. 0\u201364.2 hours, P = 0.02). In the subset of patients with SSTIs, time to optimal and de-escalation of antibiotic therapy was reduced during the intervention period compared with baseline (IQR 0\u20136.6 vs. 0-70.8, P = 0.02 and IQR 0\u201326.5 vs. 0-65.5, P = 0.05, respectively), but not with pneumonia. Length of hospital stay (median 6 days in each, P = 0.60) and number of vancomycin levels (median 0 vs. 1, P = 0.33) were similar before and after assay implementation. CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in time to optimal antibiotic therapy after implementation of the PBP2a assay driven by changes in SSTI regimens but not pneumonia regimens. Incorporation of a rapid test to differentiate MSSA from MRSA be a useful addition to antibiotic stewardship initiatives to optimize therapy for patients with MSSA infection. DISCLOSURES: P.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Profile in Qatar: A 7-Year Retrospective Study","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofy210.746","pmcid":"PMC6255065","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: A deadly zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had emerged over the last 7 years in the Arabian Peninsula. As of February 28, 2018, 2,182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide. The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of MERS-CoV infection as well as determine its clinical outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective-observational study of all laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection conducted at the main seven hospitals in the State of Qatar from January, 2012 to April 2018. We used the Fast Track diagnostics real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), targeting the upE and ORF1a genes respectively. Demographics, clinical information, potential contacts and probable risk factors were collected and analyzed by standard statistical methods. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence was 1.7 per 100,0000 person-years. Among the 24 confirmed cases of of MERS-CoV, males constituted the vast majority of cases (23 males) with a median age of 52 years (range 22\u201374). Fifty percent of the cases were Qatari and 42% reside in the same region. 67% of the cases had contact with camels, and 21% had contact with MERS-CoV-infected patient. Thirty-eight had travel history within 2 weeks of symptoms onset to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Fifty percent were smokers and 42% had comorbidities. The median symptoms duration was 4.5 days. Most of the patient presented with flu-like symptoms, were fever was the most common presentation, followed by cough, SOB, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache, 96%, 83%, 33%, 8%, 8% and 4%, respectively. All patients were admitted to a tertiary hospital with a median hospital stay 41 days (8\u201397). Forty-five percent patients developed severe sepsis with multi-organ failure and needed ICU admission. Fifty percent patients developed acute kidney injury, 29% patients were on hemodialysis and 16% needed extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Thirty-three percent patients died. The rest of patients had recovered from the infection and discharged home. Among those who died all had one or more comorbidities.

Rhinovirus in Children Presenting to the Emergency Department: Role of Viral Load in Disease Severity and Co-Infections","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofz360.2304","pmcid":"PMC6810026","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus (RV) quantitation by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR is limited by variable amplification efficiency across genotypes. We used a precise viral quantitation method, reverse transcription-digital PCR (RT-dPCR), to characterize the role of viral load in clinical outcomes and in viral co-infections in children presenting to a tertiary hospital emergency department (ED). METHODS: Children \u003C 18 years with respiratory symptoms for \u2264 14 days were enrolled from December 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Participants had nasal and throat specimens obtained and multiplex PCR testing with a commercial assay (FilmArray; bioMerieux). RV positive samples were quantified using RT-dPCR. Samples with sufficient viral load were sequenced at a 543 bp fragment of the RV VP4/VP2 region. RV species were assigned by comparison to RV sequences in GenBank using BLAST. Clinical data were collected into REDCap. T-tests were used to compare mean viral loads between groups. RESULTS: Of 1703 children enrolled in the ED, 697 were RV/enterovirus positive by FilmArray [median age 18 months (interquartile range 9\u201339 months)]. Of 590 subjects with viral load available, 276 (47%) were admitted to the hospital. Among RV mono-infections (N = 434), mean viral load did not differ between subjects admitted vs. discharged from the ED (7.03 log copies/mL for both, P = 0.97). Among admitted subjects with RV mono-infection, viral load also did not differ between subjects requiring supplemental oxygen vs. not (7.01 vs. 7.10 log copies/mL, P = 0.6). Subjects with viral co-infections had lower mean RV viral loads (6.31 log copies/mL) compared with those with RV only (7.03 log copies/mL; P \u003C 0.001) (figure). Significantly different RV viral loads were seen with co-infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV) and parainfluenza (PIV), but not with influenza, adenovirus or coronavirus. In 525 sequenced samples (46% RV-A, 4% RV-B, 50% RV-C), viral load did not vary between RV viral species (P = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Precise viral quantitation demonstrates children co-infected with RV and RSV, MPV or PIV have lower nasal viral loads than those with RV alone. Among RV mono-infections, RV viral load was not associated with admission or need for supplemental oxygen.

Recent data indicate that integration of this novel information is required for a better understanding of the seasonal differences in the frequency of particular lung infections and to find new approaches to risk stratification of patients.

The results indicated that a CotB-based surface display system was successfully used to express the CTB-OVA epi protein on the surface of vegetative B. subtilis cells.","publish_time":"2010-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Meimei; Enomoto, Keiichi","journal":"World J Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1da0fa78ef53499810d97aa88aaf09df71894ce1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088572/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CotB protein","CTB-OVA epi protein","foreign protein","fusion protein","CotB-based surface display system","surface of vegetative Bacillus subtilis cells","novel surface display system","CotB anchoring motif","subtilis spore coat","western blotting","immunodominant ovalbumin T-cell epitope","immunofluorescence microscopy","order","repeats","cholera toxin B subunit","localization","flow cytometry","C-terminal","expression","results"],"language":"en"},

The various formats of nucleic acid amplification are the most frequently used molecular tests in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In many clinical settings, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is clearly the method of choice due to its exquisite sensitivity and specificity. Today, many conventional PCR methods are being replaced by real-time PCR, which allows more rapid detection and quantification of the PCR product, as well as detection of different strains of the pathogen by melting curve analysis. The ability to measure the quantity of microbe by quantitative PCR has become increasingly important, providing information on the progression and prognosis of disease, and effectiveness of treatment. Other widely used molecular diagnostic techniques are isothermal amplification methods and nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Microarray is a technique which holds promise and has an exceptional sensitivity and the capacity to detect several pathogens simultaneously. However, microarrays are currently too expensive to be adapted for routine diagnostics, and their diagnostic use requires broad-based nucleic acid amplification prior to analysis which is not well established. Several molecular methods can be used for genotyping, which allows the identification of different subtypes of the pathogen; genotyping plays a role in the risk assessment and management of infections. Clinicians need to recognize the enhanced accuracy and speed of the molecular diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of infections, but also to understand their limitations. Laboratory results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient, and appropriate site, quality, and timing of specimen collection are required for reliable test results.","publish_time":"2009-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurkela, Satu; Brown, David W.G.","journal":"Medicine (Abingdon)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108329.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108329/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular diagnostic techniques","molecular methods","molecular tests","quantitative PCR","PCR product","real-time PCR","conventional PCR methods","nucleic acid hybridization techniques","broad-based nucleic acid amplification","diagnostic use","isothermal amplification methods","various formats of nucleic acid amplification","genotyping","clinical settings","clinical presentation","diagnosis of infections","detection of different strains","Clinical microbiology laboratories","rapid detection","management of infections","curve analysis","exquisite sensitivity","exceptional sensitivity","Laboratory results","identification of different subtypes","diagnosis of infectious diseases","reliable test results","quality","timing of specimen collection","patient","role","polymerase chain reaction","speed","appropriate site","risk assessment","enhanced accuracy","prognosis of disease","progression","routine diagnostics","quantity of microbe","quantification","information","capacity","method of choice","effectiveness of treatment","ability","Clinicians","specificity","context","microarrays","pathogens","limitations"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnostic testing methods can alleviate some of these challenges by providing definitive diagnoses earlier in the clinical course, leading to appropriate targeted therapy, cost savings, and improved patient outcomes. The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (RP2plus; bioM\u00E9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 14 common viral and 4 bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from those meeting MERS-CoV epidemiological criteria. The aim of this study was to verify the FilmArray RP2plus for use in our biocontainment unit. Of note, the RP2plus is FDA approved but not currently available for sale in the United States. Eight patient samples were tested with known results (GenMark Respiratory Virus Panel [RVP] or Cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV). We had concordant results between the platforms for samples containing influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 2, rhinovirus, and a negative sample. We evaluated two influenza B samples from two different patients. The FilmArray RP2plus did not detect influenza B in one of the patient samples. The sample was exhausted and repeat testing could not be performed. A second rhinovirus sample was not detected by the RP2plus, but Coronavirus 229E was detected in this sample, a virus not detected by the RVP. The sample was repeated and again did not detect rhinovirus. Further investigation into this discrepancy revealed that rhinovirus was originally detected by RVP at a signal of 34.4 nA (repeat of 46.9 nA). The concordant rhinovirus sample had a signal of 226.7 nA by RVP, which was much higher than the discrepant sample. Because of the low signal by RVP in the discrepant sample, perhaps the viral load was below the limit of detection of the RP2plus. All other quality control sample pools passed verification testing, including day-to-day and operator variance. It is not uncommon for a person under investigation (PUI) for a highly communicable disease to be evaluated in our facility. The performance of the RP2plus test on clinical samples showed acceptable concordance with our current means of testing for respiratory pathogens. The RP2plus will eliminate challenges implicated in storing and transporting specimens to an off-site lab, facilitate quicker turnaround time, and streamline the often cumbersome, complex protocols and practices required to work up a serious communicable disease.","publish_time":"2019-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dean, Christina L; Alvey, Emily; Evans, Crystal; Hill, Charles; Burd, Eileen; Kraft, Colleen","journal":"Am J Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109885/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marcy"],"organizations":["FDA","Cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV","RVP"],"locations":["France","Middle East","United States"],"keyphrases":["FilmArray RP2plus","discrepant sample","concordant rhinovirus sample","RP2plus test","RVP","negative sample","clinical samples","patient samples","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza B samples","GenMark Respiratory Virus Panel","bacterial respiratory pathogens","BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel","repeat testing","quality control sample pools","verification testing","parainfluenza virus","detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","current means of testing","clinical course","clinical ramifications","RSV","concordant results","low signal","investigation","challenges","Rapid diagnostic testing methods","improved patient outcomes","serious communicable disease","known results","limit of detection","viral load","meeting MERS-CoV epidemiological criteria","multiplexed nucleic acid test","cost savings","acceptable concordance","France","appropriate targeted therapy","nasopharyngeal swabs","off-site lab","bioM\u00E9rieux","Cepheid Xpert Flu","Emerging infectious diseases","Marcy l\u2019Etoile","quicker turnaround time","practices","definitive diagnoses","PUI","use","different patients","platforms","operator variance","biocontainment unit","sale","United States","complex protocols","person","specimens","FDA","study","performance","note","discrepancy","aim","facility"],"language":"en"},

The role of infection in the pathogenesis of COPD, acute exacerbation and disease progression has been a clinical and research question for many years, and the pendulum has swung from infection as a major cause of acute exacerbation and COPD (British Hypothesis) [2], to infection as an unrelated epiphomenon in acute exacerbation [3\u20135], and back again to infection as integral in the development of AECOPD and likely an important contributor to COPD progression [6\u201319]. Upwards of 80 % of AECOPD are driven by infectious stimuli, with 40\u201350 % associated with bacterial infection and 30\u201350 % associated with acute viral infection, with some exacerbations having dual bacterial and viral causation [20].

Blood cultures, cultures of respiratory specimens and urine antigen tests are recommended to determine the causative bacterial pathogen. Positive blood cultures range from 15 to 25% of CAP patients according to severity. Whether sputum specimens represent or not lower respiratory secretions determines its accuracy in CAP microbial diagnosis. In intubated patients, endotracheal aspirates are often of interest. Detection of positive pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigen is often associated with CAP severity. The sensitivity of this test is not decreased in patients who have received antibiotics prior to sampling. Viral pneumonia account for 10 to 40% of severe CAP. Nasal swabs are recommended for influenza identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in order to deliver oseltamivir treatment. In the emergency department, atypical pneumonia serology is less useful than respiratory specimens obtained using fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

In this chapter four puzzles in virus research are taken under the scope in order to probe some of the intriguing ways by which viruses can help us understand life on Earth. These puzzles consider the origin of genetic information in viruses, viruses as symbiotic partners, the structural diversity of viruses and the role of viruses in the origin of cellular life. More than providing answers, this introduction exemplifies how viruses can be approached from various angles and how each of the angles can open up new ways to appreciate their potential contributions to life.","publish_time":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jalasvuori, Matti","journal":"Viruses: Essential Agents of Life","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80b4179eb0ac1cc91682cf1aa32c0cecd815928b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119923.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Earth"],"keyphrases":["role of viruses","ocean of viruses","evolution of life","origin of cellular life","structural diversity of viruses","cell-based tree of life","shadow","puzzles","new ways","intriguing ways","important role","various angles","origin of genetic information","symbiotic partners","mere ethereal partner","constitutive factor","virus research","potential contributions","scope","chapter","existence","order","Virosphere","answers","introduction","companion","Earth"],"language":"en"},

Personalized medicine is increasingly recognized in healthcare system. In this chapter, the readers would understand the applications of biotechnology in human health care system. It has also impacted the environment which is loaded by toxic compounds due to human industrialization and urbanization. Bioremediation process utilizes use of natural or recombinant organisms for the cleanup of environmental toxic pollutants. The development of insect and pest resistant crops and herbicide tolerant crops has greatly reduced the environmental load of toxic insecticides and pesticides. The increase in crop productivity for solving world food and feed problem is addressed in agricultural biotechnology. The technological advancements have focused on development of alternate, renewable, and sustainable energy sources for production of biofuels.

Though partially effective antifibrotic therapies have focused attention away from older inflammation-based hypotheses for IPF pathogenesis, innate and adaptive immune cells and processes may play roles potentially in initiation and/or disease progression in IPF and/or in IPF acute exacerbations, based on multiple lines of evidence. Members of the Toll-like family of innate immune receptors have been implicated in IPF pathogenesis, including a potential modulatory role for the lung microbiome. A variety of chemokines are associated with the presence of IPF, and an imbalance of angiogenic chemokines has been linked to vascular remodelling in the disease. Subsets of circulating monocytes, including fibrocytes and segregated-nucleus-containing atypical monocytes (SatM), have been identified that may facilitate progression of fibrosis, and apoptosis-resistant pulmonary macrophages have been shown to demonstrate pro-fibrotic potential. Inflammatory cells that have been somewhat dismissed as irrelevant to IPF pathogenesis are being re-evaluated in light of new mechanistic data, such as activated neutrophils which release their chromatin in a process termed NETosis, which appears to mediate age-related murine lung fibrosis. A greater understanding is needed of the role of lymphoid aggregates, a histologic feature of IPF lungs found in close proximity to fibroblastic foci and highly suggestive of the presence of chronic immune responses in IPF, as are well-characterised activated circulating T lymphocytes and distinct autoantibodies that have been observed in IPF. There is a pressing need to discern whether or not the indisputably present immune dysregulation of IPF constitutes cause or effect in the ongoing search for more effective therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2018-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butler, Marcus W.; Keane, Michael P.","journal":"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7480b463b721952c7a9f17de9cfdcc6ca3a04ab3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IPF pathogenesis","presence of IPF","IPF acute exacerbations","present immune dysregulation of IPF","histologic feature of IPF lungs","adaptive immune cells","presence of chronic immune responses","family of innate immune receptors","progression of fibrosis","disease progression","potential modulatory role","Subsets of circulating monocytes","oxidative stress","activated neutrophils","lung microbiome","age-related murine lung fibrosis","atypical monocytes","variety of chemokines","Inflammatory cells","endoplasmic reticulum stress","well-characterised activated circulating T lymphocytes","role of lymphoid aggregates","effective antifibrotic therapies","effective therapeutic strategies","imbalance of angiogenic chemokines","pro-fibrotic potential","older inflammation-based hypotheses","infection","tobacco smoke","alveolar epithelium","factors","environmental exposures","microbial colonisation","microaspiration","cause","focused attention","ongoing search","close proximity","distinct autoantibodies","fibroblastic foci","consequence of repetitive micro-injury","resultant aberrant wound healing","processes","light of new mechanistic data","apoptosis-resistant pulmonary macrophages","nucleus","chromatin","fibrocytes","initiation","Toll","roles","multiple lines of evidence","vascular remodelling","NETosis","SatM","Members","greater understanding","pressing need"],"language":"en"},

Joint training in surveillance and outbreak investigation has led to improved surveillance and control of zoonotic diseases by young professionals from human health and animal health sectors. Field epidemiology training programs for veterinarians (FETPV) is a living branch of a mature FETP which could support the development of wildlife and ecosystem needs under a broad One Health canopy. FETP can be a practical means of actualizing the One Health approach based upon shared needs and mutual benefit. One such model for sustainable, joint capacity development in field epidemiology under a One Health approach has been initiated in Thailand and is being adopted in other Asian countries. The Field Epidemiology Training Network of FETP in Southeast Asia is a useful platform for further strengthening regional disease surveillance and improving response to both public and animal health problems of international concern.","publish_time":"2014-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iamsirithaworn, Sopon; Chanachai, Karoon; Castellan, David","journal":"Confronting Emerging Zoonoses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4aed6c623836f157b275498ab52db2e22d8221ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FETP"],"locations":["Thailand","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["public health","Health approach","human health","health emergencies","Health canopy","animal health sectors","animal health service","Field epidemiology training programs","related health sciences","Field Epidemiology Training Network of FETP","animal health problems of international concern","Joint training","Field epidemiologists","mature FETP","regional disease surveillance","young professionals","recruit professionals","improved surveillance","disease etiology","outbreak investigations","primary group of professionals","joint capacity development","real-life outbreaks","development of wildlife","shared needs","evidence-based recommendations","control of zoonotic diseases","Southeast Asia","major principle","useful platform","FETPV","veterinarians","response","risk factors","source","living branch","decision makers","model","duties","ecosystem","mutual benefit","practical means","spread","Thailand","Asian countries"],"language":"en"},

This classification accounts for the size of the involved vessels. This chapter outlines the clinical and histologic features of the small-vessel vasculitis including the immune complex vasculitis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; medium-vessel vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease; large-vessel vasculitis, namely, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis; variable-vessel vasculitis such as Behcet disease and Cogan syndrome; and vasculitis associated with systemic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus vasculitis, and sarcoid vasculitis. Vasculitis can also be secondary to drugs, infection, underlying systemic disease, or trauma. Therefore, a diagnosis of vasculitis cannot be based on histologic ground alone.

The stress response is mediated largely by activation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis with the release of cortisol. In general, there is a graded cortisol response to the degree of stress, such as the type of surgery. Cortisol levels also correlate with the severity of injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale, and the APACHE score. Cortisol effects the transcription of thousands of genes in every cell of the body. In addition, the cortisol\u2013glucocorticoid receptor complex effects cellular function by non-transcriptional mechanisms. Cortisol has several important physiological actions on metabolism, cardiovascular function, and the immune system. Cortisol increases the synthesis of catecholamines and catecholamine receptors, which are partially responsible for its positive inotropic effects. In addition, cortisol has potent anti-inflammatory actions including the reduction in number and function of various immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils at sites of inflammation.

The receptor of IL-22, however, is preferentially detected on peripheral tissue epithelial cells. IL-22 functions as a unique messenger from immune system to tissue epithelial cells and to regulate homeostasis of epithelia. IL-22 is able to directly enhance antimicrobial defense mechanisms in epithelial cells and to facilitate epithelial barrier repair and wound healing process. It, therefore, possesses an irreplaceable role in host defense against certain pathogens that specifically invade epithelial cells. In addition, IL-22 can help to preserve the integrity and homeostasis of various epithelial organs during infection or inflammation. The importance of its tissue-protective function is manifested in many inflammatory situations such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and hepatitis. On the other hand, as a cytokine, IL-22 is capable of induction of proinflammatory responses, especially in synergy with other cytokines. Consequently, IL-22 contributes to pathogenesis of certain inflammatory diseases for example psoriasis.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaoting; Ouyang, Wenjun","journal":"Cytokine Frontiers","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72ffcaf349069ebbdac12da2a77bb3abff3f53b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120444.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120444/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor of IL","peripheral tissue epithelial cells","homeostasis of various epithelial organs","epithelial barrier repair","inflammatory bowel diseases","pathogenesis of certain inflammatory diseases","inflammatory situations","tissue-protective function","certain pathogens","host defense","various leukocytes","family cytokine","homeostasis of epithelia","antimicrobial defense mechanisms","immune system","wound healing process","unique messenger","infection","irreplaceable role","capable of induction","example psoriasis","proinflammatory responses","functions","IBD","inflammation","integrity","synergy","hepatitis","importance","hand","cytokines","Interleukin","addition"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, those discharged to a subacute care facility have a higher mortality rate compared to those discharged home (31 vs. 17 %). The decision to admit an elderly patient to an ICU should be based not only on their comorbidities, acuity of illness, and prehospital functional status, including quality of life, but also on their preference for the use of life-sustaining treatments if it is known. The underlying disease process is not altered despite the use of invasive procedures in terminally ill patients, and potential harm or discomfort can occur if invasive procedures are used inappropriately.

These actions support the development of new pharmacological therapies based on the increase in Ang-(1-7) in the lungs to improve the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magalh\u00E3es, Giselle S.; Campagnole-Santos, Maria Jose; da Gl\u00F3ria Rodrigues-Machado, Maria","journal":"Angiotensin-(1-7)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c845b9467cec222d814de7652a94e94eb894afbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang"],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary hypertension","pulmonary inflammation","pulmonary remodeling","pulmonary fibrosis","treatment of respiratory diseases","treatment of inflammatory diseases","pathophysiology of main lung diseases","role of angiotensin","new therapeutic possibilities","acute respiratory distress syndrome","development of new pharmacological therapies","involvement of renin angiotensin system","RAS","ARDS","asthma","antifibrotic activities","increase","current advances","actions","lungs","Studies","date","present chapter"],"language":"en"},

Biology: the age and sex of the person; the genetic makeup including heritable diseases. At the current time, biological factors are the hardest to change, although many are hopeful that genetic engineering may change this at some point. For this reason, most public-sector investment in public health aims to affect the behavioral, social, environmental and medical access determinants. . 2. Behaviors: alcohol, tobacco, substance abuse; risk-prone lifestyles, such as working as a miner or prostitute. . 3. Social: discrimination, income disparities, socioeconomic status, education, occupation, class, social support. Poorer people often lack time and opportunity to exercise. Food for a healthier diet tends to be more expensive and takes longer to prepare. A strong and consistent finding of epidemiological research is that there are health differences among socioeconomic groups. Lower mortality, morbidity, and disability rates among socioeconomically advantaged people have been observed for hundreds of years. . 4. Environment (or total ecology): where a person lives, sanitary and crowding conditions, air and water quality, lead exposure, and the design of neighborhoods. Some of the most dramatic improvements in population health during the twentieth century include: improved water, food, and milk sanitation, reduced physical crowding, improved nutrition, and central heating with cleaner fuels. Most Americans live in urban areas, which are often associated with harmful health behaviors, such as exercise, diet, sexual behavior, alcohol and substance abuse. Cities also have higher levels of air pollution, which may cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Crowded buildings may increase the risk of lead exposure as well as asthma. Those that live in rural areas have other risks, such as exposure to pesticides. . 5. Medical care: access to quality health care; having insurance. For example, the availability of Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) was expanded greatly with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. This resulted in greater access to medical care for a previously underserved population. Similarly, the nationwide shift to high-deductible insurance plans has actually reduced accessibility to affordable healthcare for many. ;","publish_time":"2017-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mankowitz, Scott","journal":"Clinical Informatics Board Review and Self Assessment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/361ee9355e1f938c53c62420e197d4af6a1c765b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120799/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health insurance","quality health care","population health","public health","Medical care","health differences","harmful health behaviors","medical access determinants","risk of lead exposure","Affordable Care Act","water quality","improved water","substance abuse","alcohol","social support","greater access","Food","exercise","crowding conditions","physical crowding","socioeconomic status","person lives","improved nutrition","high-deductible insurance plans","socioeconomic groups","advantaged people","genetic makeup","healthier diet","genetic engineering","Poorer people","current time","underserved population","biological factors","affordable healthcare","urban areas","rural areas","risk-prone lifestyles","higher levels of air pollution","education","occupation","income disparities","milk sanitation","sexual behavior","disability rates","central heating","class","accessibility","discrimination","tobacco","century","consistent finding of epidemiological research","nationwide shift","availability of Medicaid","morbidity","public-sector investment","risks","Lower mortality","cleaner fuels","total ecology","heritable diseases","reason","Cities","opportunity","passage","dramatic improvements","Crowded buildings","design of neighborhoods","respiratory disease","Environment","Biology","example","hundreds of years","Americans","pesticides","asthma","miner","prostitute","point"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies have shown that using face masks is correlated to an individual\u2019s age and gender, where females and older adults are more likely to wear a mask than males or youths. There are only a few studies quantifying the impact of using face masks to slow the spread of an epidemic at the population level, and even fewer studies that model their impact in a population where the use of face masks depends upon the age and gender of the population. We use a state-of-the-art agent-based simulation to model the use of face masks and quantify their impact on three levels of an influenza epidemic and compare different mitigation scenarios. These scenarios involve changing the demographics of mask usage, the adoption of mask usage in relation to a perceived threat level, and the combination of masks with other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing and social distancing. Our results shows that face masks alone have limited impact on the spread of influenza. However, when face masks are combined with other interventions such as hand sanitizer, they can be more effective. We also observe that monitoring social internet systems can be a useful technique to measure compliance. We conclude that educating the public on the effectiveness of masks to increase compliance can reduce morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2013-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mniszewski, Susan M.; Del Valle, Sara Y.; Priedhorsky, Reid; Hyman, James M.; Hickman, Kyle S.","journal":"Theories and Simulations of Complex Social Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fac43437842c1cffc4ecfd2211bcd1965cd7ceb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120816.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of face masks","combination of masks","effectiveness of masks","influenza epidemic","spread of influenza","limited impact","population level","non-pharmaceutical interventions","adoption of mask usage","demographics of mask usage","SARS epidemic","gender","fewer studies","compliance","Recent studies","effective non-pharmaceutical intervention","spread of airborne viruses","hand washing","individual\u2019s age","hand sanitizer","social distancing","perceived threat level","social internet systems","different mitigation scenarios","females","relation","H1N1 pandemic","useful technique","older adults","state-of-the-art agent-based simulation","morbidity","levels","mortality","youths","Evidence","public","results"],"language":"en"},

They are believed to play a central role in evolution, are responsible for various human diseases, and have important contributions to biotechnology and nanotechnology. Viruses undergo evolutionary selection for efficient transmission from host to host by exploiting the host\u2019s gene expression machinery (e.g., ribosomes) for the expression of the genes encoded in their genomes. As a result, viral genes tend to be expressed via non-canonical mechanisms that are very rare in living organisms. Many of the gene expression stages and other aspects of the viral life cycle are encoded in the viral transcripts via \u2018silent codes\u2019, and are induced by mutations that are synonymous to the viral amino acid content. In a series of studies that included the analyses of dozens of organisms from the three domains of life, it was shown that there are overlapping \u2018silent codes\u2019 in the genetic code that are related to all stages of gene expression regulation. The aim of this chapter is to summarize the current knowledge related to the silent codes in viral genomes and the open questions in the field.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goz, Eli; Zur, Hadas; Tuller, Tamir","journal":"Evolutionary Biology: Self/Nonself Evolution, Species and Complex Traits Evolution, Methods and Concepts","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/001b7a3388e3c1e712a01e30cdd8dbd3e8535e1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121003.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral genomes","viral genes","viral transcripts","gene expression stages","viral life cycle","silent codes\u2019","stages of gene expression regulation","living organisms","viral amino acid content","host\u2019s gene expression machinery","Viruses","nucleic acid","domains of life","living cells","aspects","important contributions","various human diseases","evolutionary selection","efficient transmission","open questions","analyses of dozens","current knowledge","ribosomes","non-canonical mechanisms","genetic code","small infectious agents","chapter","central role","biotechnology","nanotechnology","particles","mutations","series of studies","field","oceans","result","aim"],"language":"en"},

Bacterial infections predominate, and the agents and antibiotic susceptibility profiles vary widely in different regions. Invasive candidiasis is infrequent with fluconazole use, but the incidence of invasive aspergillosis is on the rise, mainly in patients receiving purine analogues or intensive chemotherapy before transplant. In the post-engraftment period, infections are less frequent, but may contribute to significant non-relapse mortality. The dynamics of immune reconstitution drives the risk for infection in this period. The most frequent infections are varicella-zoster virus disease and respiratory tract infections.

The siRNA-based RNAi is more efficient, specific and safe antisense technology than other RNAi approaches. The route of siRNA administration for siRNA therapy depends on the targeted site. However, certain hurdles like poor stability of siRNA, saturation, off-target effect, immunogenicity, anatomical barriers and non-targeted delivery restrict the successful siRNA therapy. Thus, advancement of an effective, secure, and long-term delivery system is prerequisite to the medical utilization of siRNA.

STEC disease is characterized by hematological (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), renal (acute kidney injury) and extrarenal organ involvement. Clinicians should always strive for an etiological diagnosis through the microbiological or molecular identification of Stx-producing bacteria and Stx or, if negative, serological assays. Treatment of STEC-HUS is supportive; more investigations are needed to evaluate the efficacy of putative preventive and therapeutic measures, such as non-phage-inducing antibiotics, volume expansion and anti-complement agents. The outcome of STEC-HUS is generally favorable, but chronic kidney disease, permanent extrarenal, mainly cerebral complication and death (in less than 5 %) occur and long-term follow-up is recommended.

It focuses, in particular, on the recent rise to prominence of non-communicable diseases on the global health agenda. Once considered to be diseases of affluence, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease have recently come to be seen as a threat to both the global population and the global economy. Strategies to combat the proliferation of NCDs have simultaneous been shown to be particularly cost-effective, making NCD interventions a solid global health investment. This chapter contrasts the current era of global health, in which health is imagined in as a form of human capital and a site of investment with a post-war era of international health during which health was advocated as a human right and public good. Drawing on empirical material including historical documents, published reports and the scientific literature, it argues that the transition from international to global health can be best understood as resulting from the rise of economic rationalities in the field of world health over the last 25 years.","publish_time":"2017-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kenny, Katherine E.","journal":"History of Economic Rationalities","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eea2cbd05f11c76f9ce3cdb9e5d2c156dfe506a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123985.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123985/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health agenda","solid global health investment","current era of global health","post-war era of international health","field of world health","global population","global economy","prominence of non-communicable diseases","diseases of affluence","transition","rise of economic rationalities","chapter","role of economic rationalities","site of investment","recent rise","proliferation of NCDs","human right","form of human capital","NCD interventions","reports","cancer","historical documents","diabetes","empirical material","cardiovascular disease","scientific literature","Strategies","threat","years"],"language":"en"},

In particular, the fibrinogen \u03B1 chain and more specifically the serum levels of the 5.9 kDa fragment of fibrinogen \u03B1 C-chain have shown to be altered in several hepatic etiologies. In fact, these results have been reproduced by different laboratories, and recently a marked downregulation of this protein fragment has also been described in the initial stages of liver fibrosis.

Two main endothelial ligand\u2013receptor pathways regulating angiogenesis are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and angiopoietin-TIE receptor pathways. The angiopoietin-TIE pathway is required for the remodeling and maturation of the blood and lymphatic vessels during embryonic development after VEGF and VEGF-C mediated development of the primary vascular plexus. Angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) stabilizes the vasculature after angiogenic processes, via tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 2 (TIE2) activation. In contrast, ANGPT2 is upregulated at sites of vascular remodeling. ANGPT2 is secreted by activated endothelial cells in inflammation, promoting vascular destabilization. ANGPT2 has been found to be expressed in many human cancers. Intriguingly, in preclinical models inhibition of ANGPT2 has provided promising results in preventing tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis, making it an attractive candidate to target in tumors. However, until now the first ANGPT2 targeting therapies have been less effective in clinical trials than in experimental models. Additionally, in preclinical models combined therapy against ANGPT2 and VEGF or immune checkpoint inhibitors has been superior to monotherapies, and these pathways are also targeted in early clinical trials. In order to improve current anti-angiogenic therapies and successfully exploit ANGPT2 as a target for cancer treatment, the biology of the angiopoietin-TIE pathway needs to be profoundly clarified.","publish_time":"2019-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiss, Elina A.; Saharinen, Pipsa","journal":"Tumor Angiogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cf7df301d8bcb22fc1e675ed63e96eb636fe9e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tumor angiogenesis","tumor growth","angiopoietin-TIE receptor pathways","preclinical models inhibition of ANGPT2","angiopoietin-TIE pathway","vascular endothelial growth factor","vascular destabilization","sites of vascular remodeling","VEGF-C mediated development","endothelial cells","Tumor blood vessel formation","primary vascular plexus","metastasis","experimental models","target","main endothelial ligand","early clinical trials","embryonic development","current anti-angiogenic therapies","lymphatic vessels","immune checkpoint inhibitors","biology","promising results","angiogenic processes","tyrosine kinase","therapy","cancer treatment","vasculature","immunoglobulin","monotherapies","maturation","inflammation","domains","TIE2","attractive candidate","order","ANGPT1","activation","tumors","contrast","human cancers"],"language":"en"},

Four new life cycle behaviours are named: nursery hiding, mid-moult stage, positive precursor (intraspecific antagonism) and negative precursor (ambush strategy). Further strategies discussed are opossum attack, double parasitism (doubling of the normal reproductive set), duplex arrangement (separated male-female pairs), simple rebrooding, and describing how displaced parasites and superinfections may partly elucidate life cycles. Proportional stunting masks life history effects of parasitism; cuckoo copepods are true parasites and not just associates; burrowing barnacles (acrothoracicans) are not parasites. Further findings based on life cycle information: branchiurans and pentastomes are possibly not related; firefly seed shrimp are not parasites; copepod pre-adult life cycle stages are common in the western pacific but rare in Caribbean; harpacticoids on vertebrates are not parasites; cuckoo copepods are true parasites; explained the importance of pennellid intermediate hosts. Crustacean parasite life cycles are largely unknown (1% of species). Most crustacean life cycles represent minor modifications from the ancestral free-living mode. Crustacean parasites have less complex and less modified life cycles than other major parasite groups. This limits their exploitation of, and effectiveness, in parasitism. However, these life cycles will be an advantage in Global Change.

Basically, they break the hydrogen bonding between the duplex helix and translocate unidirectionally along the bound strand. Mostly all the helicases contain some conserved signature motifs, which act as an engine to power the unwinding. After the discovery of the first prokaryotic DNA helicase from Escherichia coli bacteria in 1976 and the first eukaryotic one from the lily plant in 1978, many more (\u003E100) have been isolated. All the helicases share some common properties, including nucleic acid binding, NTP hydrolysis and unwinding of the duplex. Many helicases have been crystallized and their structures have revealed an underlying common structural fold for their function. The defects in helicases gene have also been reported to be responsible for variety of human genetic disorders, which can lead to cancer, premature aging or mental retardation. Recently, a new role of a helicase in abiotic stress signaling in plant has been discovered. Overall, helicases act as essential molecular tools for cellular machinery and help in maintaining the integrity of genome.

To explore the relationship between the methylation pattern of Oct4 gene exon 1 and embryonic development, in this work, five different tissues (heart, liver, lung, cerebrum and cerebellum) from three germ layers were chosen from low age (50\u201360 d) and advanced age (60\u201370 d) of fetal cattle and the differences between tissues or ages were analyzed, respectively. The result showed that the DNA methylation level of Oct4 gene exon 1 was significant different (P\u003C0.01) between any two of three germ layers in low age (\u003C60 d), but kept steady of advanced age (P\u003E0.05) (\u003E60 d), suggesting that 60-d post coital was an important boundary for embryonic development. In addition, in ectoderm (cerebrum and cerebellum), there was no significant methylation difference of Oct4 gene exon 1 between low age and advanced age (P\u003E0.05), but the result of endoderm (liver and lung) and mesoderm (heart) were on the contrary (P\u003C0.01), which indicated the development of ectoderm was earlier than endoderm and mesoderm. The methylation differences from the 3rd, 5th and 9th CpG-dinucleotide loci of Oct4 gene exon 1 were significantly different between each two of three germ layers (P\u003C0.05), indicating that these three loci may have important influence on bovine embryonic development. This study showed that bovine germ layers differentiation was significantly related to the DNA methylation status of Oct4 gene exon 1. This work firstly identified the DNA methylation profile of bovine Oct4 gene exon 1 and its association with germ layers development in fetus and adult of cattle. Moreover, the work also provided epigenetic information for further studying bovine embryonic development and cellular reprogramming.","publish_time":"2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"ZHOU, Xin-yu; LIU, Liang-liang; JIA, Wen-chao; PAN, Chuan-ying","journal":"J Integr Agric","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128269/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["methylation pattern of Oct4 gene exon","germ layers development","DNA methylation level of Oct4 gene exon","DNA methylation status of Oct4 gene exon","bovine embryonic development","significant methylation difference of Oct4 gene exon","DNA methylation profile of bovine Oct4 gene exon","low age","development of ectoderm","methylation differences","CpG-dinucleotide loci of Oct4 gene exon","bovine germ layers differentiation","different Oct4 expression levels","steady of advanced age","early embryonic development of mammalian animals","different tissues","work","d post coital","significant role","lung","liver","heart","cerebrum","cerebellum","result of endoderm","mesoderm","important boundary","important influence","adult of cattle","fetal cattle","multi-lineage differentiation","association","fetus","octamer-binding transcription factor","epigenetic information","cellular reprogramming","study","relationship","Previous studies","ages","addition"],"language":"en"},

Totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAP) are the standard access for administration of these regimens. The regimens usually involve periods of neutropenia for which infection can increase morbidity and require removal of the port. Although deemed safe for use in cancer populations, many studies have only looked at patients with TIVAP in solid tumor malignancies. Herein, we report our single institution experience identifying modulators for infection related to TIVAP in this high-risk population. OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for port infection in HM patients. METHODS: We performed an IRB-approved single institution retrospective review of HM patients who had a TIVAP removed for port infection versus completion of therapy. Medical records were evaluated for patient demographics and tumor type, details of previous therapy regimens such as chemotherapy and HSCT status, laboratory values including albumin, white blood cell, neutrophil and platelet counts, as well as characteristics of the TIVAP. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed between the two cohorts to identify clinical predictors of port infection necessitating TIVAP removal. RESULTS: Between March 2015 and July 2018, 104 TIVAPs were removed from HM patients, 34 (33%) for infection and 70 (67%) for completion of treatment. Median patient age was 60 years (range 22-86) and there was an even number of men and women (n=52). Most TIVAPs were double lumen (n=98, 94%) and placed in the right IJV (n=100, 96%). The median number of port days was 49 in the infection group and 414 in the completion group, with removal of 12 (35%) of the infected ports within 30 days. Multiple factors were significant predictors of port infection on univariate analysis, including diagnosis of AML or ALL (p=0.0019), no prior HSCT (p=0.0148), neutropenia within 30 days of removal (p\u003C0.0001), ANC \u003C1500 (p \u003C0.0001), leukopenia the day prior to removal (p\u003C0.0001), thrombocytopenia (p \u003C0.0001), and hypoalbuminemia (p\u003C0.0001). Steroid use, leukopenia or leukocytosis the day of placement, and leukocytosis the day prior to removal were not significantly different between the two groups. On multivariate analysis, no prior HSCT (OR=48.08, 95% CI 2.64-875.63, p=0.009), neutropenia within 30 days of removal (OR=67.60, 95% CI 1.68-2726.66, p=0.026), and hypoalbuminemia (OR=405.52, 95% CI 15.64-10517.89, p\u003C0.0001) remained significant. CONCLUSION: In patients with HM, significant predictors of port infection requiring TIVAP removal included neutropenia within 30 days of removal and hypoalbuminemia. Interestingly, patients who underwent HSCT were less likely to a develop a port infection requiring TIVAP removal.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peterson, Shawn Lanham; Priddy, Erin; Dong, Brian Yang; Ghazi, Cameron Alexander; Dinglasan, Lu Anne Velayo","journal":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128306/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TIVAP","HSCT","ANC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TIVAP removal","days of removal","significant predictors of port infection","infection group","clinical predictors of port infection","median number of port days","prior HSCT","HSCT status","hypoalbuminemia","single institution retrospective review of HM patients","completion of therapy","periods of neutropenia","completion group","completion of treatment","multi-chemotherapy regimens","details of previous therapy regimens","univariate analysis","leukocytosis","leukopenia","day of placement","multivariate analysis","TIVAPs","single institution experience","solid tumor malignancies","Median patient age","tumor type","patient demographics","risk factors","Multiple factors","standard access","implantable venous access ports","Steroid use","Hematologic malignancies","infected ports","number of men","white blood cell","multivariate regression analyses","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","laboratory values","platelet counts","IRB","aggressive processes","modulators","diagnosis of AML","cancer populations","years","studies","cohorts","morbidity","range","Medical records","double lumen","women","characteristics","administration","INTRODUCTION","high-risk population","OBJECTIVES","right IJV","CONCLUSION","thrombocytopenia","groups","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

While attention in the global health community has focused on emerging diseases, there has been a concurrent, growing recognition that important chronic diseases, such as cancer, are often caused by infectious agents that are already widespread in human populations. For economically prosperous countries, the immediacy of this threat contrasts with their infrastructural protection from severe acute infectious disease. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that chronic infectious diseases pose a more significant threat to economically prosperous countries than zoonotic, acute infectious diseases.

To address the problem, RNA interference (RNAi) has recently been widely used as a potential antiviral approach. Transgenesis, in combination with RNAi to specifically inhibit AIV gene expression, has been proposed to make chickens resistant to avian influenza. For the transgenic breeding, screening the efficient siRNAs in vitro as the candidate genes is one of the most important tasks. Here, we combined an online search tool and a series of bioinformatics programs with a set of rules for designing the siRNAs targeting different mRNA regions of AIV H5N1 subtype. By this method we chose five rational siRNAs, constructed five U6 promoter-driven shRNA expression plasmids contained the siRNA genes, and used these to produce stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Data from virus titration, IFA, PUI-stained flow cytometry, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and DAS-ELISA analyses showed that all five stably transfected cell lines were effectively resistant to viral replication when exposed to 100 CCID50 of AIV, and we finally chose the most effective plasmids (pSi-604i and pSi-1597i) as the candidates for making the transgenic chickens. These findings provide baseline information for breeding transgenic chickens resistant to AIV in combination with RNAi.","publish_time":"2010-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, P.; Wang, J.

The cells grew and secreted mAb stably. Antibody titers in the culture supernatant and ascites were 2.048\u00D710(6) and 4.096\u00D710(6), respectively. By applying the anti-HBs G6 mAb and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-HBs antibody, we developed a sandwich ELISA (defined G6m ELISA) for detecting both wild-type and immune escape mutant HBsAgs (IEM HBsAg). The assay was performed to detect 17 species of genome recombinant expression HBsAg, including two wild-type species and 15 IEM HBsAg species, which varied in the \u201Ca\u201D determinant, in a group of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The patients previously had a lower ELISA detection signal [(absorbance of patients/absorbance of normal people (P/N): 1.0\u20134.5)]. The results demonstrated that the sensitivity of this assay to wild-type HBsAg was no less than 0.125 \u03BCg/L; 12 of 15 IEM HBsAg species (P/N\u2A7E2.5) were positive for G6 mAb. Of the positive IEM HBsAg species, two had a low absorbance value at 450 nm (A (450)), one had an intermediate A450 value and nine had a high A (450) value, which was 7.55%(mean), 59.4%and 92.1%\u2013109.4% of the wild-type A (450) value, respectively. The two species with low A (450) value and the three negative species mutated at the bases 120\u2013124 in the first loop of the HBV \u201Ca\u201D determinant. Using the G6 ELISA and two commercial ELISA kits (A and B), 177 patients were tested. The G6 ELISA had a significantly higher detection rate than either commercial ELISAs (19.21% vs 14.89% and 6.21%, respectively; P\u003C0.01, P\u003C0.05, respectively).","publish_time":"2009-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Fanghe; Zhang, Chunyan; Liu, Jinghua; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Yan, Bing; Zhang, Bo; Huang, Yongguo; Gong, Jingsong; Chen, Yan","journal":"Front Med China","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089361/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["P/N","HBV","G6 ELISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G6 ELISA","wild-type species","positive IEM HBsAg species","wild-type HBsAg","sandwich ELISA","anti-HBs G6 mAb","defined G6 mAb","negative species","absorbance of patients","commercial ELISA kits","defined G6m ELISA","low absorbance value","species of genome recombinant expression HBsAg","secreted mAb","lower ELISA detection signal","goat anti-HBs antibody","group of patients","intermediate A450 value","Antibody titers","HBV","determinant","hybridoma cell line strain secreting anti-HBs monoclonal antibody","absorbance of normal people","commercial ELISAs","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","higher detection rate","hepatitis B virus","HRP","immune escape mutant HBsAgs","horseradish peroxidase","standard cellular fusion technique","culture supernatant","ascites","sensitivity","nm","vs","cells","bases","results","loop","\u03BCg","mean"],"language":"en"},

During the last few decades, increasing foodborne diseases and environmental generated illnesses are considered to be highly challenging issues. Biosensor technology holds great promise for the healthcare market, and the security sector. Similar to clinical diagnostic tools, biosensors are being developed for the rapid, reliable, yet inexpensive identification and enumeration of pathogenic viruses which are adulterating environment, food and feed commodities. In this modern era, bio-and nano-technologies play a pivotal role in virological diagnostics of food industry, environmental and veterinary samples.

Embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) play key roles in the innate recognition and wound healing in reproductive tissues. METHODS: Based on the relative toxicities of different inorganic metals and inorganic nonmetallic compounds against murine and chicken EF cells, mechanistic estimations were performed based on transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: Lead (II) acetate induced preferential injuries in the chicken EF and mechanistic analyses using transcriptome revealed that chemokine receptor-associated events are potently involved in metal-induced adverse actions. As an early sentinel of metal exposure, the precision-cut intestine slices (PCIS) induced the expression of chemokines including CXCLi1 or CXCLi2, which were potent gut-derived factors that activate chemokine receptors in reproductive organs after circulation. CONCLUSION: EF-selective metals can be estimated to trigger the chemokine circuit in the gut-reproductive axis of chickens. This in vitro methodology using PCIS-EF culture could be used as a promising alternate platform for the reproductive immunotoxicological assessment.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ki Hyung; Kim, Juil; Han, Jae Yong; Moon, Yuseok","journal":"Mol Cell Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b7d34858c0cf545623fcfffa28eb577df837613.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EF-selective metals","reproductive tissues","reproductive organs","chicken EF cells","PCIS-EF culture","chemokine receptors","Heavy metals","chemokine circuit","mechanistic analyses","reproductive immunotoxicological assessment","gut-reproductive axis of chickens","relative toxicities of different inorganic metals","mechanistic estimations","chemokine receptor-associated events","Embryonic fibroblasts","transcriptomic analyses","embryonic development","inorganic nonmetallic compounds","potent gut-derived factors","early sentinel of metal exposure","transcriptome","innate recognition","key roles","precision","various processes","wound healing","CXCLi2","acetate","promising alternate platform","preferential injuries","expression of chemokines","CXCLi1","EFs","intestine slices","BACKGROUNDS","circulation","Lead"],"language":"en"},

Clinical testing could be used to detect influenza in these studies if factors associated with clinical testing for influenza were better understood. METHODS: Adults hospitalized with ARI at three study sites during the study period were enrolled in CDC\u2019s 2015\u201316 Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) study and tested for influenza by RT-PCR. Clinical testing information, presenting symptoms, and patient characteristics were collected from medical records and patient interview. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds of receiving a clinical test based on age, vaccination status, comorbidities, presentation with influenza-like illness (ILI; defined as fever and cough or sore throat) and other factors. RESULTS: Of 895 enrollees, 571 (64%) patients meeting study inclusion criteria received physician-ordered testing. Of these, 53% had a multipathogen panel, 13% had a rapid antigen test, 7% had singleplex PCR, \u003C1% had viral culture, and 27% had multiple tests; influenza infection was detected in 55 (6%) patients. Of 150 influenza cases identified by study testing, 25 (17%) were not tested clinically. Enrollees who did not receive clinical testing were older, had longer time to admission, and were less likely to present with ILI. Immunosuppressive disorders (aOR=2.05), non-COPD lung conditions (aOR=1.68), presentation with ILI (aOR=4.03), and admission \u22642 days from symptom onset (aOR=1.89) were positively associated with receiving a clinical test (P \u003C 0.01 for all; Figure 1). After adjusting for these factors, enrollees with influenza vaccination were 37% less likely (aOR=0.63) to receive a clinical test (P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with ARI who were clinically tested for influenza differed from those not tested. A lower likelihood of testing among influenza positive vaccinees could potentially bias VE estimates upward and requires further evaluation. Clinical testing alone may fail to detect a substantial proportion of influenza cases.

IC patients were more likely to have underlying renal disease (27% vs. 18%) and liver disease (7% vs. 3%) and less likely to have most other chronic underlying conditions including obesity (18% vs. 23%), cardiovascular disease (40% vs. 47%), and chronic lung disease (35% vs. 41%; P \u003C 0.01 for all). IC patients were more likely to have received influenza vaccination (53% vs. 46%; P \u003C 0.01). Among cases with symptom data (2014\u20132015), IC patients were more likely to present with fever (68% vs. 61%; P \u003C 0.01) but respiratory distress was similar (53% vs. 54%; P = 0.3). Overall, the majority of IC and non-IC patients received antivirals (87% vs. 85%; P \u003C 0.01). IC patients had a longer duration of hospitalization (median (IQR) 4 (2\u20136) vs. 3 (2\u20136) days; P \u003C 0.01) and were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (34 vs. 31%; P \u003C 0.01) and to require intensive care (18% vs. 16%; P = 0.01). Death during hospitalization occurred in 135 (3.7%) IC and 945 (3.0%) non-IC patients (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Among adults hospitalized with influenza, IC patients had worse outcomes including a longer duration of hospitalization and higher probability of pneumonia and intensive care unit admission, and increased all-cause mortality, although these results are not adjusted for potential confounders.

Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) are rare, but devastating and life-threatening complications post hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It has been suggested in work by others that IPS and BO are consequences of early inflammation, and recent data support this hypothesis (Versluys et al, Translational and Clinical Immunology, 2018). Respiratory viral infections early in the peri-transplant period may result in inflammation leading to development of IPS and BO post HSCT. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether pre-transplant respiratory viral infection or colonization increase incidence of IPS and BO. We hypothesized that patients who acquire respiratory viral infections in the peri-transplant period have increased incidence of IPS and BO. METHODS: We abstracted and analyzed clinically collected data and compared the frequency of post-transplant respiratory viral complications with the presence of upper respiratory viral infections within 30 days prior to transplant. A Broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) or a nasal swab were used to identify upper respiratory viral infections. Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other upper respiratory viral infections were tested in 181 patients, transplanted between 2008 and 2018. Outcomes studied included IPS, BO, transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and overall survival (OS). Patients who did not have a BAL or a nasal swab within 30 days prior to transplant were excluded. RESULTS: Forty seven of 181 patients had a positive BAL or nasal swab prior to HSCT (group A). There were 53 documented respiratory viral infections in group A. Two tested positive for either coronavirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) or para-influenza virus, 3 tested positive for adenovirus, human herpes 6, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), EBV and CMV were detected in 9 patients, 1 patient had human metapneumovirus and there were 16 rhino virus infections documented prior to HSCT. Some patients tested positive for more than 1 respiratory viral infection at the time of testing. Results of our study are summarized below in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, our data do not support an association between upper respiratory viral infections prior to transplant and post-transplant IPS or BO. Our data may differ from the findings of others due to a relatively small number of events in our population, or to differences in patient populations being studied, or to differences in transplant strategies.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapadia, Malika; Perentesis, Emma MR; Lane, Adam; Dandoy, Christopher E; Davies, Stella M.","journal":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Epstein Barr"],"organizations":["Translational and Clinical Immunology","IPS","BAL","HSCT","CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["documented respiratory viral infections","presence of upper respiratory viral infections","pre-transplant respiratory viral infection","post-transplant IPS","frequency of post-transplant respiratory viral complications","respiratory syncytial virus","transplant strategies","patients","rhino virus infections","peri-transplant period","incidence of IPS","BO post HSCT","development of IPS","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","positive BAL","nasal swab","herpes simplex virus","para-influenza virus","recent data","Epstein Barr virus","human herpes","EBV","group","hypothesis","CMV","days","study","differences","RESULTS","consequences of early inflammation","life-threatening complications","human metapneumovirus","pediatric population","patient populations","colonization","HSV","graft","Versluys et","TMA","coronavirus","adenovirus","bronchiolitis obliterans","thrombotic microangiopathy","GVHD","cytomegalovirus","RSV","host disease","association","Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome","BACKGROUND","overall survival","Clinical Immunology","time of testing","Broncho alveolar lavage","primary objective","small number of events","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSION","work","Outcomes","Figure","findings","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

L\u2019EPP est difficile sans outil pertinent. Notre objectif est d\u2019illustrer l\u2019int\u00E9r\u00EAt d\u2019un TB pour r\u00E9aliser une EPP. MAT\u00C9RIELS ET M\u00C9THODES: Notre TB existe depuis Juillet 2005, incluant 24 param\u00E8tres dont le diagnostic, l\u2019antibioth\u00E9rapie et la date d\u2019hospitalisation.

R\u00C9SULTATS: Les PAC repr\u00E9sentaient 178 hospitalisations avant l\u2019application du protocole, et 81 apr\u00E8s. Le taux de conformit\u00E9 avec le protocole \u00E9tait respectivement de 101/178 (57 %), et de 52/81 (64 %). Le nombre d\u2019antibioth\u00E9rapies contenant des FQ et/ou des C3G de mani\u00E8re inad\u00E9quate \u00E9tait de 45/178 (25 %) durant la premi\u00E8re p\u00E9riode, et de 19/81 (23 %) durant la seconde p\u00E9riode. Plusieurs lignes th\u00E9rapeutiques \u00E9taient utilis\u00E9es 28/178 fois (16 %) et 12/81 fois (15 %). La dur\u00E9e d\u2019hospitalisation \u00E9tait respectivement de 9 \u00B1 5 et 8 \u00B1 5 jours, une \u00E9volution d\u00E9favorable \u00E9tant observ\u00E9e dans 8/178 (5 %) et 1/81 cas (1,2 %). CONCLUSION: Un TB permet l\u2019ex\u00E9cution rapide de 2 des 3 phases de l\u2019EPP.

It has narrowly lanceolate valves (26\u201355 \u03BCm long, 4\u20135 \u03BCm wide) and girdles 10\u201324 \u03BCm in depth. Striae are parallel at the center of the valve (24\u201328 in 10 \u03BCm), becoming slightly convergent toward the apices. Electron microscopy revealed that the external valve surface presents a longitudinally ribbed appearance (20\u201328 parallel ribs at its maximum width), whereas internally, rectangular areolae are occluded by ricae. The raphe slit lies in a narrow axial area, and one side of the raphe sternum is deeper and folds over the other, obscuring the internal opening. Internally, the central virga on one side of the raphe and two virgae on the other are somewhat broader. A conspicuous pore (stigma) is present between the two broadened virgae. The girdle consists of valvocopulae, copulae, and pleurae. There are 16\u201320 bands per cingulum. The valvocopulae and copulae are hollow tube\u2010like structures, with inner and outer portions contrsting in morphology. They decrease in diameter in an abvalvar direction. There are four pleurae. These are flat bands which facilitate overlap of the epicingulum and hypocingulum. Fundamental features of the valve and girdle reveal the distinctness of this species within Navicula. The areolae, external longitudinal ribs, and raphe structure suggest affinities with Pleurosigma, Gyrosigma, and Haslea. It is hypothesized that they share a derived state which indicates a recent common ancestor for these taxa. N. complanatoides and related species of the Naviculae microstigmatacae are distinctive enough to merit their own genus within the Naviculaceae.","publish_time":"2008-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brogan, Michael W.; Rosowski, James R.","journal":"J Phycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c31b5e9b18860f7a6524cf45602d17898b55086.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Naviculae"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["raphe structure","raphe slit","raphe sternum","\u03BCm wide","parallel ribs","external valve surface","valvocopulae","electron microscopy","pleurae","external longitudinal ribs","related species","rectangular areolae","flat bands","broadened virgae","marine pennate diatom Navicula complanatoides Hust","hollow tube\u2010like structures","prepared cells","outer portions contrsting","Pleurosigma","affinities","ribbed appearance","recent common ancestor","Naviculae microstigmatacae","Gyrosigma","morphology","overlap","girdles","distinctness","narrow axial area","derived state","maximum width","conspicuous pore","taxa","epicingulum","folds","center","Fundamental features","diameter","abvalvar direction","genus","hypocingulum","Haslea","ricae","Striae","lanceolate valves","depth","light","central virga","internal opening","Naviculaceae","apices"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, dysregulation of the RAS may lead to the development of cardiovascular pathologies including kidney injury. Moreover, the blockade of this system by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or antagonism of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) constitutes an effective therapeutic regimen. It is now apparent with the identification of multiple components of the RAS that the system is comprised of different angiotensin peptides with diverse biological actions mediated by distinct receptor subtypes. The classic RAS can be defined as the ACE-Ang II-AT(1)R axis that promotes vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and other mechanisms to maintain blood pressure, as well as increased oxidative stress, fibrosis, cellular growth, and inflammation in pathological conditions. In contrast, the non-classical RAS composed of the ACE2-Ang-(1\u20137)-Mas receptor axis generally opposes the actions of a stimulated Ang II-AT(1)R axis through an increase in nitric oxide and prostaglandins and mediates vasodilation, natriuresis, diuresis, and oxidative stress. Thus, a reduced tone of the Ang-(1\u20137) system may contribute to these pathologies as well. Moreover, the non-classical RAS components may contribute to the effects of therapeutic blockade of the classical system to reduce blood pressure and attenuate various indices of renal injury. The review considers recent studies on the ACE2-Ang-(1\u20137)-Mas receptor axis regarding the precursor for Ang-(1\u20137), the intracellular expression and sex differences of this system, as well as an emerging role of the Ang1-(1\u20137) pathway in fetal programing events and cardiovascular dysfunction.","publish_time":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chappell, Mark C.; Marshall, Allyson C.; Alzayadneh, Ebaa M.; Shaltout, Hossam A.; Diz, Debra I.","journal":"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/317f9c2b15b77682a875328e023b5b62a9eb2896.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3886117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang"],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classical system","ACE2-Ang","ACE-Ang","classic RAS","stimulated Ang","Mas receptor axis","non-classical RAS components","important hormonal system","inhibition of angiotensin","angiotensin type","renin-angiotensin","different angiotensin peptides","physiological regulation of blood pressure","distinct receptor subtypes","increased oxidative stress","development of cardiovascular pathologies","effects of therapeutic blockade","cardiovascular dysfunction","kidney injury","diverse biological actions","identification of multiple components","effective therapeutic regimen","various indices of renal injury","cellular growth","fibrosis","nitric oxide","vasodilation","inflammation","prostaglandins","fetal programing events","natriuresis","antagonism","sodium retention","pathway","diuresis","sex differences","enzyme","mechanisms","recent studies","vasoconstriction","precursor","pathological conditions","intracellular expression","review","contrast","emerging role","Ang1","reduced tone","dysregulation"],"language":"en"},

However, the detailed analysis of HBV infection under immunosuppression is essential for the prophylaxis and therapy for HBV reactivation and recurrence. In this study, HBV replication and T cell responses were analyzed in a HBV-transfected mouse model under immunosuppressive therapy. During the treatment, HBV replication was at a high level in mice treated with dexamethasone, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide, whereas was terminated in mice treated with mycophenolate mofetil. After the withdrawal, HBV replication was at low or high levels in the dexamethasone-treated mice or in both cyclosporine- and cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The early withdrawal of cyclosporine allowed the recovery of suppressed T cell responses and led to subsequent HBV clearance, while the adoptive immune transfer to the mice with HBV persistence led to HBV suppression. Taken together, long-term HBV persistence under immunosuppression depends on the immunosuppressive drugs used and on the treatment duration and is mediated by the suppressed intrahepatic CD8 T cell response. These data may be helpful for individualized immunosuppressive therapy in patients with high risk of HBV reactivation and recurrence, and the mouse system is suitable for studying HBV reactivation and recurrence under immunosuppression.","publish_time":"2014-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Junzhong; Wang, Baoju; Huang, Shunmei; Song, Zhitao; Wu, Jun; Zhang, Ejuan; Zhu, Zhenni; Zhu, Bin; Yin, Ying; Lin, Yong; Xu, Yang; Zheng, Xin; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d17ba127439d63e04c399c19a06fa63998d65e6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3897536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV replication","HBV suppression","long-term HBV persistence","high risk of HBV reactivation","subsequent HBV clearance","HBV-transfected mouse model","detailed analysis of HBV infection","recurrence","immunosuppression","dexamethasone-treated mice","cyclophosphamide-treated mice","individualized immunosuppressive therapy","hepatitis B immunoglobulin","Hepatitis B virus","hepatitis B vaccine","recovery of suppressed T cell responses","high levels","patients","immunosuppressive drugs","early withdrawal of cyclosporine","suppressed intrahepatic CD8 T cell response","mouse system","treatment duration","antivirals","adoptive immune transfer","prophylaxis","study","data","mycophenolate mofetil"],"language":"en"},

The main cause of the disease outbreak was unknown. In this study, partial spike (S), ORF3, and membrane (M) genes amplified from these variants were sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that the variants could be clustered into one to three subgroups and suggested that S genes were variable, while M genes were relatively conserved. Moreover, in comparison with the vaccine strain CV777, sequence alignment analyses revealed that the S genes of the newly isolated strains contained several mutations at the aa level. It is possible that these mutations have changed the hydrophobicity of the S protein and influenced the viral antigenicity and virulence. Interestingly, homology analyses based on ORF3 demonstrated that the isolates had an intact opening reading frame (ORF), which were different from the attenuated DR13 strain. In conclusion, the widespread PED virus (PEDV) isolates had virulent characteristics. Additionally, the high degree of variation in the genes, particularly S genes, might provide an explanation for the poor immunity and rapid spread of the disease.","publish_time":"2014-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Ruiqin; Leng, Zhangming; Zhai, Shao-Lun; Chen, Dekun; Song, Changxu","journal":"ScientificWorldJournal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c5f2a7a584371461fa19a49e49c99ecd0ef7743.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3919097.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3919097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["S genes","S protein","isolates","disease outbreak","ORF3","mutations","variants","homology analyses","sequence alignment analyses","vaccine strain CV777","widespread PED virus","attenuated DR13 strain","outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea","PEDV","intact opening reading frame","explanation","poor immunity","rapid spread","isolated strains","China","viral antigenicity","partial spike","deaths of millions","virulent characteristics","main cause","high degree of variation","suckling piglets","conclusion","comparison","study","hydrophobicity","membrane","variable","aa level","virulence","subgroups","results"],"language":"en"},

Our objective was to quantify the difference between short-term and long-term mortality in ARDS and to identify risk factors for death and causes of death at 1 year among hospital survivors. METHODS: This multi-intensive care unit, prospective cohort included patients with ARDS enrolled between January 2006 and February 2010. We determined the clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital and 1-year mortality among hospital survivors and utilized death certificate data to identify causes of death. RESULTS: Of 646 patients hospitalized with ARDS, mortality at 1 year was substantially higher (41 %, 95 % CI 37\u201345 %) than in-hospital mortality (24 %, 95 % CI 21\u201327 %), P \u003C 0.0001. Among 493 patients who survived to hospital discharge, the 110 (22 %) who died in the subsequent year were older (P \u003C 0.001) and more likely to have been discharged to a nursing home, other hospital, or hospice compared to patients alive at 1 year (P \u003C 0.001). Important predictors of death among hospital survivors were comorbidities present at the time of ARDS, and not living at home prior to admission. ARDS-related measures of severity of illness did not emerge as independent predictors of mortality in hospital survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in short-term ARDS outcomes, 1-year mortality is high, mostly because of the large burden of comorbidities, which are prevalent in patients with ARDS.

Animal models help to understand the complex interplay between the different cell types of the CNS and uncover general mechanisms of damage and repair of myelin sheaths. The so called cuprizone model is a toxic model of demyelination in the CNS white and gray matter, which lacks an autoimmune component. Cuprizone induces apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes that leads to a robust demyelination and profound activation of both astrocytes and microglia with regional heterogeneity between different white and gray matter regions. Although not suitable to study autoimmune mediated demyelination, this model is extremely helpful to elucidate basic cellular and molecular mechanisms during de- and particularly remyelination independently of interactions with peripheral immune cells. Phagocytosis and removal of damaged myelin seems to be one of the major roles of microglia in this model and it is well known that removal of myelin debris is a prerequisite of successful remyelination. Furthermore, microglia provide several signals that support remyelination. The role of astrocytes during de- and remyelination is not well defined. Both supportive and destructive functions have been suggested. Using the cuprizone model we could demonstrate that there is an important crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia. In this review we focus on the role of glial reactions and interaction in the cuprizone model. Advantages and limitations of as well as its potential therapeutic relevance for the human disease MS are critically discussed in comparison to other animal models.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gudi, Viktoria; Gingele, Stefan; Skripuletz, Thomas; Stangel, Martin","journal":"Front Cell Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4b8196a56fe00d653d288226f12952824c5b7cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3952085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3952085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cuprizone model","microglia activation","toxic model of demyelination","CNS white","role of astrocytes","major roles of microglia","robust demyelination","autoimmune mediated demyelination","prerequisite of successful remyelination","removal of myelin debris","removal of damaged myelin","Animal models","gray matter regions","repair of myelin sheaths","molecular mechanisms","profound activation","exact functions","autoimmune component","destructive functions","human disease MS","different cell types","general mechanisms of damage","role of glial reactions","characteristic features of multiple sclerosis","regional heterogeneity","complex interplay","potential therapeutic relevance","interactions","central nervous system","apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes","comparison","astrogliosis","peripheral immune cells","Phagocytosis","important crosstalk","limitations","events","signals","Advantages","review"],"language":"en"},

The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, has conserved certain aspects of the autophagic machinery but for what purpose has long remained a mystery. Major advances have recently been gained and suggest a role for Atg8 in apicoplast maintenance, degradation of heme inside the food vacuole, and possibly trafficking of proteins or organelles outside the parasite membrane.

NSDV is closely related to the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, which also causes a haemorrhagic disease. As with other nairoviruses, replication of NSDV takes place in the cytoplasm and the new virus particles bud into the Golgi apparatus; however, the effect of viral replication on cellular compartments has not been studied extensively. We have found that the overall structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi were unaffected by infection with NSDV. However, we observed that NSDV infection led to the loss of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), an oxidoreductase present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and which assists during protein folding, from the ER. Further investigation showed that NSDV-infected cells have high levels of PDI at their surface, and PDI is also secreted into the culture medium of infected cells. Another chaperone from the PDI family, ERp57, was found to be similarly affected. Analysis of infected cells and expression of individual viral glycoproteins indicated that the NSDV PreGn glycoprotein is involved in redistribution of these soluble ER oxidoreductases.

An ability to predict the magnitude and timing of peak incidence at the scale of a single large population would help to accurately assess the value of interventions designed to reduce that peak. However, current disease-dynamic theory does not provide a clear understanding of the relationship between: epidemic trajectories at the scale of interest (e.g. city); population mobility; and higher resolution spatial effects (e.g. transmission within small neighbourhoods). Here, we used a spatially-explicit stochastic meta-population model of arbitrary spatial resolution to determine the effect of resolution on model-derived epidemic trajectories. We simulated an influenza-like pathogen spreading across theoretical and actual population densities and varied our assumptions about mobility using Latin-Hypercube sampling. Even though, by design, cumulative attack rates were the same for all resolutions and mobilities, peak incidences were different. Clear thresholds existed for all tested populations, such that models with resolutions lower than the threshold substantially overestimated population-wide peak incidence. The effect of resolution was most important in populations which were of lower density and lower mobility. With the expectation of accurate spatial incidence datasets in the near future, our objective was to provide a framework for how to use these data correctly in a spatial meta-population model. Our results suggest that there is a fundamental spatial resolution for any pathogen-population pair. If underlying interactions between pathogens and spatially heterogeneous populations are represented at this resolution or higher, accurate predictions of peak incidence for city-scale epidemics are feasible.","publish_time":"2014-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mills, Harriet L.; Riley, Steven","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce5e67e3d17645302f7a91d7d0c8bc3428884187.json; document_parses/pdf_json/faad09d0c4532ac11d673b84f539be583e897df9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/aa8fbab7c3255083bf78bcf8752b279ec210e684.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3983068.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3983068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population mobility","spatial meta-population model","population-wide peak incidence","fundamental spatial resolution","effect of resolution","higher resolution spatial effects","timing of peak incidence","pathogen-population pair","explicit stochastic meta-population model of arbitrary spatial resolution","accurate predictions of peak incidence","actual population densities","single large population","lower mobility","peak incidences","expectation of accurate spatial incidence datasets","heterogeneous populations","resolutions lower","tested populations","city-scale epidemics","model-derived epidemic trajectories","lower density","specific geographical populations","clear understanding","Clear thresholds","intensive care units","emergence of novel respiratory pathogens","capacity of key health care resources","assumptions","transmission","near future","models","relationship","mobilities","magnitude","current disease-dynamic theory","Latin-Hypercube sampling","small neighbourhoods","underlying interactions","cumulative attack rates","design","objective","framework","ability","influenza","value of interventions","results"],"language":"en"},

It is not structurally related to other major apolipoproteins and has been known as a small, soluble carrier protein of lipophilic molecules that is mostly expressed in neurons and glial cells within the central and peripheral nervous system. Recent data indicate that ApoD not only supplies cells with lipophilic molecules, but also controls the fate of these ligands by modulating their stability and oxidation status. Of particular interest is the binding of ApoD to arachidonic acid and its derivatives, which play a central role in healthy brain function. ApoD has been shown to act as a catalyst in the reduction of peroxidized eicosanoids and to attenuate lipid peroxidation in the brain. Manipulating its expression level in fruit flies and mice has demonstrated that ApoD has a favorable effect on both stress resistance and life span. The APOD gene is the gene that is upregulated the most in the aging human brain. Furthermore, ApoD levels in the nervous system are elevated in a large number of neurologic disorders including Alzheimer\u0027s disease, schizophrenia, and stroke. There is increasing evidence for a prominent neuroprotective role of ApoD because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. ApoD emerges as an evolutionarily conserved anti-stress protein that is induced by oxidative stress and inflammation and may prove to be an effective therapeutic agent against a variety of neuropathologies, and even against aging.","publish_time":"2014-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dassati, Sarah; Waldner, Andreas; Schweigreiter, R\u00FCdiger","journal":"Neurobiol Aging","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3988949.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["APOD gene","binding of ApoD","ApoD levels","prominent neuroprotective role of ApoD","central role","stress resistance","anti-stress protein","oxidative stress","aging human brain","peripheral nervous system","healthy brain function","soluble carrier protein of lipophilic molecules","glial cells","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","large number of neurologic disorders","high degree of sequence conservation","lipocalin family","insects","schizophrenia","mice","antioxidant","derivatives","fruit flies","ancient member","reduction of peroxidized eicosanoids","favorable effect","expression level","variety of neuropathologies","lipid peroxidation","arachidonic acid","neurons","effective therapeutic agent","life span","stability","ligands","catalyst","mammals","stroke","evidence","anti-inflammatory activity","oxidation status","Apolipoprotein D","fate","inflammation","Recent data","major apolipoproteins"],"language":"en"},

Currently, no clinical studies of the effects of MSCs in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) exist. The objectives of this study were first to examine the possible adverse events after systemic administration of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs in ARDS patients and second to determine potential efficacy of MSCs on ARDS. METHODS: Twelve adult patients meeting the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of \u003C 200 were randomized to receive allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs or placebo in a 1:1 fashion. Patients received one intravenous dose of 1 \u00D7 10(6) cells/kg of body weight or saline. Possible side effects were monitored after treatment. Acute lung injury biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-8 and surfactant protein D (SP-D), were examined to determine the effects of MSCs on lung injury and inflammation. RESULTS: There were no infusion toxicities or serious adverse events related to MSCs administration and there were no significant differences in the overall number of adverse events between the two groups. Length of hospital stay, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day 28 after treatment were similar. There were no changes in biomarkers examined in the placebo group. In the MSCs group, serum SP-D levels at day 5 were significantly lower than those at day 0 (p = 0.027) while the changes in IL-8 levels were not significant. The IL-6 levels at day 5 showed a trend towards lower levels as compared with day 0, but this trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs appears to be safe and feasible in the treatment of ARDS. However, the clinical effect with the doses of MSCs used is weak, and further optimization of this strategy will probably be required to reach the goal of reduced alveolar epithelial injury in ARDS.

The choice of an adequate level of response relies upon available knowledge of the spatial and temporal parameters governing pathogen spread, affecting, amongst others, the predicted severity of the epidemic. Yet, when a new pathogen is introduced into an alien environment, such information is often lacking or of no use, and epidemiological parameters must be estimated from the first observations of the epidemic. This poses a challenge to epidemiologists: how quickly can the parameters of an emerging disease be estimated? How soon can the future progress of the epidemic be reliably predicted? We investigate these issues using a unique, spatially and temporally resolved dataset for the invasion of a plant disease, Asiatic citrus canker in urban Miami. We use epidemiological models, Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and advanced spatial statistical methods to analyse rates and extent of spread of the disease. A rich and complex epidemic behaviour is revealed. The spatial scale of spread is approximately constant over time and can be estimated rapidly with great precision (although the evidence for long-range transmission is inconclusive). In contrast, the rate of infection is characterised by strong monthly fluctuations that we associate with extreme weather events. Uninformed predictions from the early stages of the epidemic, assuming complete ignorance of the future environmental drivers, fail because of the unpredictable variability of the infection rate. Conversely, predictions improve dramatically if we assume prior knowledge of either the main environmental trend, or the main environmental events. A contrast emerges between the high detail attained by modelling in the spatiotemporal description of the epidemic and the bottleneck imposed on epidemic prediction by the limits of meteorological predictability. We argue that identifying such bottlenecks will be a fundamental step in future modelling of weather-driven epidemics.","publish_time":"2014-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neri, Franco M.; Cook, Alex R.; Gibson, Gavin J.; Gottwald, Tim R.; Gilligan, Christopher A.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90394841ad2cbaec78bf51646d5ca1ae26fadba6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/03e779f9defa0b9cb6a9943947e41b9c1532e3d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3998883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzExOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic prediction","complex epidemic behaviour","epidemiological parameters","future environmental drivers","future modelling of weather","main environmental events","spatial scale of spread","main environmental trend","plant disease","rate of infection","infection rate","future progress","temporal parameters","emerging disease","contrast","use","extreme weather events","advanced spatial statistical methods","rapid response","available knowledge","prior knowledge","epidemiological models","new pathogen","Uninformed predictions","predicted severity","adequate level of response","Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo","Asiatic citrus canker","complete ignorance","evidence","rates","fundamental step","urban Miami","unpredictable variability","early stages","strong monthly fluctuations","Outbreaks of infectious diseases","invasion","extent","driven epidemics","limits of meteorological predictability","long-range transmission","alien environment","policy makers","spatiotemporal description","dataset","choice","great precision","information","bottlenecks","epidemiologists","time","issues","challenge","observations"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present the complete L-P1 sequences for eight serotype A and nine serotype O viruses recovered from FMDV outbreaks in East and West Africa over the last 33 years. Phylogenetic analysis of the P1 and capsid-coding regions revealed that the African isolates grouped according to serotype, and certain clusters were indicative of transboundary as well as intra-regional spread of the virus. However, similar analysis of the L region revealed random groupings of isolates from serotypes O and A. Comparisons between the phylogenetic trees derived from the structural coding regions and the L region pointed to a possibility of genetic recombination. The intertypic nucleotide and amino acid variation of all the isolates in this study supported results from previous studies where the externally located 1D was the most variable whilst the internally located 1A was the most conserved, which likely reflects the selective pressures on these proteins.

The IL-13/TGF-\u03B2(1) interaction has previously been identified as a key pathway orchestrating fibrosis in different inflammatory immune disorders. Here we investigate if this pathway is also responsible for allograft fibrosis and if interference with the IL-13/TGF-\u03B2(1) interaction prevents allograft fibrosis. METHODS: FVB or control DBA/1 donor hearts were transplanted heterotopically into DBA/1 recipient mice and hearts were explanted at day 60 and 100 post-transplantation. Cardiac tissue was examined by Masson\u2019s trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, CD11b, IL-13, Fas ligand, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-13, \u03B22-microglobulin, and Gremlin-1. Graft-infiltrating cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-13 and TGF-\u03B2(1) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the amount of collagen was quantified using a Sircol assay; IL-13R\u03B1(2) expression was detected by Western blotting. In some experiments IL-13/ TGF-\u03B2(1) signaling was blocked with specific IL-13R\u03B1(2) siRNA. Additionally, a PCR array of RNA isolated from the allografts was performed to analyze expression of multiple genes involved in fibrosis. RESULTS: Both groups survived long-term (\u003E100 days). The allogeneic grafts were infiltrated by significantly increased numbers of CD4(\u002B) (P \u003C0.0001), CD8(\u002B) (P \u003C0.0001), and CD11b(\u002B) cells (P = 0.0065) by day 100. Furthermore, elevated IL-13 levels (P = 0.0003) and numbers of infiltrating IL-13(\u002B) cells (P = 0.0037), together with an expression of IL-13R\u03B1(2), were detected only within allografts. The expression of IL-13 and IL-13R\u03B1(2) resulted in significantly increased TGF-\u03B2(1) levels (P \u003C0.0001), higher numbers of CD11b(high)Gr1(intermediate)TGF-\u03B2(1)(\u002B) cells, and elevated cardiac collagen deposition (P = 0.0094). The allograft fibrosis found in these experiments was accompanied by upregulation of multiple profibrotic genes, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical stainings of allograft tissue. Blockage of the IL-13/TGF-\u03B2(1) interaction by IL-13R\u03B1(2) siRNA led to lower numbers of CD11b(high)Gr1(intermediate)TGF-\u03B2(1)(\u002B), CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B), and CD11b(\u002B) cells, and prevented collagen deposition (P = 0.0018) within these allografts. CONCLUSIONS: IL-13 signaling via IL-13R\u03B1(2) induces TGF-\u03B2(1) and causes allograft fibrosis in a murine model of chronic transplant rejection. Blockage of this IL-13/TGF-\u03B2(1) interaction by IL-13R\u03B1(2) siRNA prevents cardiac allograft fibrosis. Thus, IL-13R\u03B1(2) may be exploitable as a future target to reduce allograft fibrosis in organ transplantation.","publish_time":"2013-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brunner, Stefan M; Schiechl, Gabriela; Kesselring, Rebecca; Martin, Maria; Balam, Saidou; Schlitt, Hans J; Geissler, Edward K; Fichtner-Feigl, Stefan","journal":"Transplant Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39807132285b1c2ee23f9a47762a41b8be1401da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4016099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Masson"],"organizations":["Allograft","DBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of IL","elevated IL","experiments IL","specific IL","numbers of infiltrating IL","R\u03B1","increased TGF-\u03B2","cardiac allograft fibrosis","interaction","lower numbers of CD11b","higher numbers of CD11b","increased numbers of CD4","immunohistochemical stainings of allograft tissue","levels","CD8","siRNA","allografts","expression of multiple genes","Graft-infiltrating cells","elevated cardiac collagen deposition","Cardiac tissue","heart transplantation","organ transplantation","post-transplantation","Gr1","MMP","Blockage","control DBA","donor hearts","key pathway","Sircol assay","upregulation of multiple profibrotic genes","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Masson\u2019s trichrome staining","immunohistochemistry","Fas ligand","critical problem","different inflammatory immune disorders","ELISA","murine model of chronic transplant rejection","future target","FVB","matrix metalloproteinase","interference","recipient mice","groups","\u03B22-microglobulin","METHODS","PCR array of RNA","allogeneic grafts","flow cytometry","RESULTS","days","Gremlin","Western blotting","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

As a modulator of the immune pathway, it indirectly controls the amount of antimicrobial peptides. This could indicate a vital step in maintaining animal immune systems and preventing infection. Evolutionary questions are crucial to understanding the conservation and functioning of the biochemical pathways like the Tollip-mediated one. Through an analysis of 36 sequences of the Tollip protein from different animal taxa, downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databank, we inferred diverse evolutionary parameters, such as molecular selection and structure conservation, by analyzing residue by residue, beyond the canonical parameters to this type of study, as maximum likelihood trees. We found that Tollip presented different trends in its evolving history. In primates, the protein is becoming more unstable, just the opposite is observed in the arthropod group. The most interesting finding was the concentration of positively selected residues at amino terminal ends. Some observed topological incongruences in maximum likelihood trees of complete and curated Tollip data sets could be explained through horizontal transfers, evidenced by recombination detection. These results suggest that there is more to be researched and understood about this protein.","publish_time":"2014-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luiz, Denis Prudencio; Santos J\u00FAnior, C\u00E9lio Dias; Bonetti, Ana Maria; Brandeburgo, Malcom Ant\u00F4nio Manfredi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb9b75c5e290a5ff3b49c2f0f93e05a1dcff78df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4020778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tollip protein","curated Tollip data sets","maximum likelihood trees of complete","different animal taxa","animal immune systems","diverse evolutionary parameters","structure conservation","canonical parameters","different trends","Toll pathways","biochemical pathways","Evolutionary questions","immune pathway","observed topological incongruences","databank","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","selected residues","molecular selection","type of study","concentration","KEGG","Genomes","receptor IL","horizontal transfers","amino terminal ends","interleukin","functioning","vital step","sequences","important role","evolving history","opposite","recombination detection","infection","interesting finding","arthropod group","modulator","analysis","antimicrobial peptides","primates","results"],"language":"en"},

Based on a published design, we have generated several replication competent influenza A viruses carrying either fluorescent proteins or Gaussia luciferase. Reporter activity could be readily quantified in infected cultures, but the virus encoding Gaussia luciferase was more stable than viruses bearing fluorescent proteins and was therefore analyzed in detail. Quantification of Gaussia luciferase activity in the supernatants of infected culture allowed the convenient and highly sensitive detection of viral spread, and enzymatic activity correlated with the number of infectious particles released from infected cells. Furthermore, the Gaussia luciferase encoding virus allowed the sensitive quantification of the antiviral activity of the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) zanamivir and the host cell interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins 1\u20133, which are known to inhibit influenza virus entry. Finally, the virus was used to demonstrate that influenza A virus infection is sensitive to a modulator of endosomal cholesterol, in keeping with the concept that IFITMs inhibit viral entry by altering cholesterol levels in the endosomal membrane. In sum, we report the characterization of a novel influenza A reporter virus, which allows fast and sensitive detection of viral spread and its inhibition, and we show that influenza A virus entry is sensitive to alterations of endosomal cholesterol levels.","publish_time":"2014-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eckert, Nadine; Wrensch, Florian; G\u00E4rtner, Sabine; Palanisamy, Navaneethan; Goedecke, Ulrike; J\u00E4ger, Nils; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Winkler, Michael","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35d7e6d1717c9b8604c8370ffdf26ea9569aa75d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4026478.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reporter virus","influenza virus entry","virus infection","sensitive quantification","viral entry","sensitive detection of viral spread","Quantification of Gaussia luciferase activity","rapid quantification of virus replication","Reporter activity","viral genomes","analysis of viral spread","antiviral activity","novel influenza","replication competent influenza","enzymatic activity","fluorescent proteins","modulator of endosomal cholesterol","alterations of endosomal cholesterol levels","viruses","infected cells","infected cultures","endosomal membrane","Reporter genes","supernatants of infected culture","screening of antiviral compounds","host cell interferon-inducible transmembrane","zanamivir","NAI","neuraminidase inhibitor","number of infectious particles","characterization","concept","IFITMs","inhibition","pathogenesis","published design","sum"],"language":"en"},

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI. METHODS: CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched. Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included. Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods. RESULTS: From 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO. Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days. ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used. ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days. Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I(2 )= 64%). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection. Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.","publish_time":"2013-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zangrillo, Alberto; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Landoni, Giovanni; Frati, Giacomo; Patroniti, Nicol\u00F2; Pesenti, Antonio; Pappalardo, Federico","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f2ad42d6136940e6bf5befc67155deee58128cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4057025.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057025/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["ECMO","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","ECMO implementation","H1N1 influenza","suspected H1N1 infection","H1N1-associated ALI","hospital mortality","hospital death","included studies","inter-hospital patient transfer","cases","random-effect methods","days","Random-effect pooled estimates","conventional mechanical ventilation","baseline patient features","median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","multiorgan failure","severe comorbidities","short-term mortality","prolonged support","severe acute lung injury","SOFA","intensive care unit admission","gas exchange","Google Scholar","validity data","high risk","meta-analysis","MEDLINE","subjects","PubMed","score","role","systematic review","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Scopus","initial citations","week","CONCLUSIONS","INTRODUCTION","veno-venous configuration","RESULTS","Outcomes","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been used in these patients with conflicting results. We describe our experience with rFVIIa for refractory bleeding in this setting and review the cases reported in the literature. METHODS: Clinical characteristics, demographics, bleeding, thrombotic complications, mortality, and rFVIIa administration were retrospectively collected for analysis from the electronic charts of the 15 patients in our intensive care unit who received rFVIIa while being given ECMO from January 2006 to March 2011. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received rFVIIa for persistent bleeding under venoarterial (n = 11) or venovenous (n = 4) ECMO. Bleeding dramatically decreased in 14 patients, without a major thrombotic event, except in one patient in whom a major stroke could not be ruled out. Two circuits were changed within the 48 hours after rFVIIa administration for clots in the membrane and decreased oxygenation but without massive clotting. The mortality rate was 60%. CONCLUSIONS: rFVIIa use for intractable hemorrhaging in patients receiving ECMO controlled bleeding, without major thrombotic events, and with 60% dying. Hence, its use warrants discussion, and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of potentially life-threatening systemic thrombosis, emboli, or circuit clotting.

The chimeric VLP was composed of matrix 1 protein from avian influenza H5N1 virus and a fusion protein neuraminidase (NA)/spike 1 (S1) that was generated by fusing IBV S1 protein to the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of NA protein of avian influenza H5N1 virus.

Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information. However, research into this area is still lacking. The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze. This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies. METHODS: A Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed. Participants were recruited by snowball sampling. The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants. Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated. RESULTS: A total of 298 respondents took part in the survey. Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education. More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire. Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access. In addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6). The total Impact of Event Scale\u2013Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder. The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P\u003C.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis. Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies. Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage. In addition, our findings also suggested that there are acute physical and psychological impacts on the population from an air-pollution crisis.","publish_time":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Melvyn WB; Ho, Cyrus SH; Fang, Pan; Lu, Yanxia; Ho, Roger CM","journal":"JMIR Mhealth Uhealth","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4114481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["psychological wellbeing","smartphone technologies","psychological stress","smartphone Web-based application","Web-based questionnaire","number of physical symptoms","psychological impacts","smartphone application","Internet-based website technologies","conventional technologies","Crisis situations","Web-based database","air-pollution crisis","data collection","use of Internet","study population","questionnaire link","group of participants","acquisition of crucial research data","general population","direct link","direct access","new system","new mechanisms","feedback","demographic variables","mechanism of access","respondents","RESULTS","SD","survey","addition","new social networking websites","higher IES-R Score","social media","mean number","Recent developments","Information pertaining","current study","mechanism of usage","affected individuals","newer technological modalities","post-traumatic stress disorder","total Impact of Event Scale","PSI","perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index","nongovernment organizations","researchers","gender","self-sponsored Facebook post","challenges","potential","governments","dissemination","public institutions","educational levels","Southeast Asian Haze","emails","Statistical analysis","years","large-scale consequential after-effects","METHODS","university education","findings","snowball sampling","option","BACKGROUND","studies","week","ages","OBJECTIVE","area","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of GA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(\u002B))-induced damage to differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells. Compared with the MPP(\u002B)-treated cells, GA markedly improved cell viability, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed the overexpression of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and suppressed the overproduction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and intracellular Ca(2\u002B) overload. The protective effects of GA on cell survival were further confirmed in primary cortical neurons. GA markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), as well as its migration from the cytoplasm to nucleus. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, blocked GA-enhanced ERK activation and reduced cell viability. However, pre-treatment with GA had no effects on the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT (t-AKT). These results indicate that the GA-mediated neuroprotective effects are associated with its modulation of multiple anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, particularly the ERK signaling pathway.

Here we show that TTF-1 disrupts the nuclear Smad3-Smad4 complex without affecting the nuclear localization of phospho-Smad3. Genome-wide analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed that TTF-1 colocalizes with Smad3 on chromatin and alters Smad3-binding patterns throughout the genome, while TTF-1 generally inhibits Smad4 binding to chromatin. Moreover, Smad3 binds to chromatin together with TTF-1, but not with Smad4, at some Smad3-binding regions when TGF-\u03B2 signaling is absent, and knockdown of Smad4 expression does not attenuate Smad3 binding in these regions. Thus, TTF-1 may compete with Smad4 for interaction with Smad3, and in the presence of TTF-1, Smad3 regulates the transcription of certain genes independently of Smad4.

Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03B2 (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-\u03B2). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection. To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, Mavs and Trif deficient animals were infected with RSV. In vivo induction of airway IL-1\u03B2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-\u03B3, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22, MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice. Loss of Trif expression in mice altered the RSV induction of IL-1\u03B2, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12 and IFN-\u03B3. Silencing of retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), and Trif expression. To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner. Expression of LIF protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.

In vitro studies have shown that \u039421 IFITM3 loses its ability to restrict H1N1 IAV. Subsequent research has also revealed that tyrosine 20 is the key determinant for IFITM3 endocytic trafficking, which is essential for the efficient anti-viral activity of IFITM3. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrated that both \u039421 IFITM3 and an IFITM3 variant (Y20A IFITM3), in which tyrosine 20 is substituted with alanine, strongly restricted entry mediated by IAV H1, H3, H5, and H7 proteins. \u039421 IFITM3 also efficiently suppressed replication of H1N1 and, to a lesser extent, H3N2 IAV. \u039421 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 had broader subcellular distributions than full-length IFITM3 but an abundant amount of both IFITM3 variants still localized to late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data indicate that tyrosine 20 partially regulates the subcellular localization of IFITM3 but is not functionally essential for IFITM3-mediated IAV restriction.

In order to determine the source of these variations, factors influencing the measurement by ELISA were explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood from healthy individuals was collected into various vacutainers during the same blood draw. Recombinant SP-D was diluted into different matrices and used for a standard curve. Samples were analyzed by capture ELISA using one of two distinct detection antibodies. RESULTS: The type of matrix had some effects on detection of recombinant SP-D. The type of anticoagulant used and dilution factor had very little effect, except for in plasma collected in EDTA vacutainers. The extent of variation in published values seemed to be due to the ELISA configuration employed, and, in agreement with this, we found that by switching the detection antibody, there was a 50% decrease in the extrapolated SP-D value of serum and plasma samples. Storage of samples resulted in slight changes in measured SP-D levels. CONCLUSIONS: The ELISA configuration employed to measure circulating levels of SP-D has a significant effect on the extrapolated values. In both configurations tested, the use of EDTA as a coagulant resulted in inconsistent values, and we, therefore, suggest the avoidance of this anticoagulant when assaying for SP-D by ELISA. While the demonstrated effects of several factors on measurement of SP-D may not account for all the disparities amongst the previous studies, they stress that variations in methodologies for measuring the same protein can result in very inconsistent results.","publish_time":"2014-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bratcher, Preston E.; Gaggar, Amit","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc4332792ad6c643b1142cef1d344755a64b9625.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4218753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4218753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EDTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Recombinant SP-D","levels of SP","measured SP-D levels","measurement of SP","detection of recombinant SP-","extrapolated SP-D value of serum","ELISA configuration","capture ELISA","human surfactant protein D","plasma samples","extrapolated values","published values","inconsistent values","Extensive variations","factors","type of anticoagulant","EDTA vacutainers","Storage of samples","detection antibody","inconsistent results","distinct detection antibodies","significant effect","Peripheral blood","little effect","various vacutainers","type of matrix","blood draw","demonstrated effects","use of EDTA","published literature","slight changes","healthy individuals","METHODS","dilution factor","BACKGROUND","different matrices","circulation","MATERIALS","previous studies","extent of variation","source","standard curve","disparities","configurations","methodologies","CONCLUSIONS","order","agreement","avoidance"],"language":"en"},

Many of these factors are released into exosomes, which are small membranous vesicles that participate in cell\u2013cell communication. Exosomes from MSCs are thought to have similar functions to MSCs such as repairing and regeneration of damaged tissue, but little is known about the immunomodulatory effect of these vesicles. Based on an extensive bibliography where the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated, here we hypothesized that released exosomes from MSCs may have an immunomodulatory role on the differentiation, activation and function of different lymphocyte subsets. According to this hypothesis, in vitro experiments were performed to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of human adipose MSCs derived exosomes (exo-hASCs) on in vitro stimulated T cells. The phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic and helper T cells (activation and differentiation markers) together with functional assays (proliferation and IFN-\u03B3 production) demonstrated that exo-hASCs exerted an inhibitory effect in the differentiation and activation of T cells as well as a reduced T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03B3 release on in vitro stimulated cells. In summary, here we demonstrate that MSCs-derived exosomes are a cell-derived product that could be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.","publish_time":"2014-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blazquez, Rebeca; Sanchez-Margallo, Francisco Miguel; de la Rosa, Olga; Dalemans, Wilfried; \u00C1lvarez, Ver\u00F3nica; Tarazona, Raquel; Casado, Javier G.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff7d7dea55e89908b0a3935c6e5ce52cd8a165b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4220146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4220146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MSCs-derived exosomes","activation of T cells","immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs","stimulated T cells","stimulated cells","immunomodulatory effect of human adipose MSCs derived exosomes","helper T cells","reduced T cell proliferation","cell-derived product","cell communication","immunomodulatory role","differentiation markers","exo-hASCs","IFN-\u03B3 release","inhibitory effect","biological activity of mesenchymal stem cells","IFN-\u03B3 production","release of paracrine factors","small membranous vesicles","functional assays","treatment of inflammation","phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic","function of different lymphocyte subsets","extensive bibliography","therapeutic agent","related diseases","similar functions","regeneration of damaged tissue","experiments","recent years","hypothesis","summary"],"language":"en"},

Breastfeeding and serum IgG have been shown to protect against RSV infection. Yet, many infants depend on bovine milk-based nutrition, which at present lacks intact immunoglobulins. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether IgG purified from bovine milk (bIgG) can modulate immune responses against human RSV. METHODS: ELISAs were performed to analyse binding of bIgG to human respiratory pathogens. bIgG or hRSV was coated to plates to assess dose-dependent binding of bIgG to human Fc\u03B3 receptors (Fc\u03B3R) or bIgG-mediated binding of myeloid cells to hRSV respectively. S. Epidermidis and RSV were used to test bIgG-mediated binding and internalisation of pathogens by myeloid cells. Finally, the ability of bIgG to neutralise infection of HEp2 cells by hRSV was evaluated. RESULTS: bIgG recognised human RSV, influenza haemagglutinin and Haemophilus influenza. bIgG bound to Fc\u03B3RII on neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, but not to Fc\u03B3RI and Fc\u03B3RIII, and could bind simultaneously to hRSV and human Fc\u03B3RII on neutrophils. In addition, human neutrophils and dendritic cells internalised pathogens that were opsonised with bIgG. Finally, bIgG could prevent infection of HEp2 cells by hRSV. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here show that bIgG binds to hRSV and other human respiratory pathogens and induces effector functions through binding to human Fc\u03B3RII on phagocytes. Thus bovine IgG may contribute to immune protection against RSV.","publish_time":"2014-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"den Hartog, Gerco; Jacobino, Shamir; Bont, Louis; Cox, Linda; Ulfman, Laurien H.; Leusen, Jeanette H.

Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we investigated a case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique. A novel parvovirus was discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a novel genus. The possible causative correlation between this virus and the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected animal were positive. The virus was present in all tested organs (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum samples collected up to 8 years before death. All attempts to identify a latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was consistent with absence of latency. Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma. It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.","publish_time":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canuti, Marta; Williams, Cathy V.; Gadi, Sashi R.; Jebbink, Maarten F.; Oude Munnink, Bas B.; Jazaeri Farsani, Seyed Mohammad; Cullen, John M.; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3559efd0d0327a8262022dcdd40d01a6f468cb82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4249460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4249460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel virus","novel oncoviruses","novel parvovirus","novel genus","animal health","years","banked serum samples","organ samples","broad spectrum virus discovery technique","cancer virotherapy","dividing cancer cells","Nycticebus coucang","viral sequences","recognizing viruses","case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma","infected animal","latent viral form","leading health concerns","possible causative correlation","year old slow loris","intestine","episomal","tested organs","new exciting opportunities","report","spleen","liver","increase of variation","kidneys","phylogenetic analysis","lungs","study","animals","tumor progression","oncogenic mechanisms","parvoviruses","cell division","absence of latency","attempts","role","pygmaeus","malignancy","sequenced genome","carcinogenesis","member","cause","tumorigenesis process","death"],"language":"en"},

Radix Ginseng (RG), a traditional herb used as herbal remedy in eastern Asia for thousands of years, which has been traditionally used in China to improve blood circulation and ameliorate pathological hemostasis. This study investigated whether Ginsenoside Rb1, the main components of RG, can attenuate ALI induced by LPS. METHODS: In vivo, 30 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n = 10 each groups) on the basis of the reagent used, which were subjected to LPS injection with or without Ginsenoside Rb1 (5 mg/kg) treatments to induce ALI model. Lung injury was assessed by pulmonary histology, lung wet-weight to dry-weight (W/D) ratio, the number of myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells, immunohistochemical analysis of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), gene expression of ICAM-1, ultrastructure changes of pulmonary microvasculature, concentration of inflammatory markers and in plasma. In vitro, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were stimulated with LPS in the presence and absence of Ginsenoside Rb1 (50 mM), nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) p65 was measured by immunocytochemistry staining and western blotting. RESULTS: Infusion of LPS induced lung injury, in vivo, as demonstrated by pulmonary edema with infiltration of neutrophils and hemorrhage, the increase in lung W/D ratio, the number of MPO positive cells, the level of inflammatory markers such as TNF-\u03B1, MCP-1 and IL-8, enhanced expression of ICAM-1 and ICAM-1 gene. Moreover, resulted in the changes of intercellular junctions in the endothelial cells of pulmonary microvasculature. In vitro, the significant increased release of NF-\u03BAB p65 and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus in PMVECs were observed. In contrast, Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment significantly ameliorated the LPS-induced lung injury, as judged by the marked improvement in all these indices. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated LPS-induced lung injury through an inhibition of the inflammatory signaling pathway, besides the direct inhibitory effect on proinflammatory molecules.","publish_time":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Qing; Jiang, Yan-wen; Ma, Ting-ting; Fang, Qiu-hong; Pan, Lei","journal":"J Inflamm (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efec63d7ec82c600c98bb482acd61d152f88596d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4272525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4272525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Radix Ginseng","ALI"],"organizations":["ICAM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated LPS-induced lung injury","Infusion of LPS induced lung injury","acute lung injury","lung wet-weight","Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment","absence of Ginsenoside Rb1","LPS injection","endothelial cells of pulmonary microvasculature","pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells","pulmonary histology","pulmonary edema","gene expression of ICAM","number of MPO positive cells","NF-\u03BAB","\u03BAB p65","ultrastructure changes of pulmonary microvasculature","enhanced expression of ICAM","D ratio","concentration of inflammatory markers","level of inflammatory markers","RESULTS","PMVECs","groups","ALI model","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","changes of intercellular junctions","dry-weight","number of myeloperoxidase","main components of RG","significant increased release of NF","immunohistochemical analysis of intercellular adhesion molecule","herbal remedy","hemorrhage","eastern Asia","subsequent translocation","direct inhibitory effect","traditional herb","pathway","TNF-\u03B1","inhibition","immunocytochemistry staining","infiltration of neutrophils","blood circulation","proinflammatory molecules","thousands of years","Sepsis","neutrophil sequestration","presence","male Wistar rats","pathological hemostasis","western blotting","BACKGROUND","MCP","nucleus","plasma","contrast","Radix Ginseng","marked improvement","indices","METHODS","China","basis","treatments","CONCLUSIONS","study","reagent"],"language":"en"},

Despite this progress, there are few mathematical models of within-host dengue dynamics, and the ones that exist focus primarily on the general role of immune cells in the clearance of infected cells, while neglecting other components of the immune response in limiting viraemia. Here, by considering a suite of mathematical within-host dengue models of increasing complexity, we aim to isolate the critical components of the innate and the adaptive immune response that suffice in the reproduction of several well-characterized features of primary and secondary dengue infections. By building up from a simple target cell limited model, we show that only the innate immune response is needed to recover the characteristic features of a primary symptomatic dengue infection, while a higher rate of viral infectivity (indicative of antibody-dependent enhancement) and infected cell clearance by T cells are further needed to recover the characteristic features of a secondary dengue infection. We show that these minimal models can reproduce the increased risk of disease associated with secondary heterologous infections that arises as a result of a cytokine storm, and, further, that they are consistent with virological indicators that predict the onset of severe disease, such as the magnitude of peak viraemia, time to peak viral load, and viral clearance rate. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of these virological indicators to predict the onset of severe disease depends on the contribution of T cells in fuelling the cytokine storm.","publish_time":"2015-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ben-Shachar, Rotem; Koelle, Katia","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ac6114492dec5eb4c4afe605b1a83c689df0dec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/306bedd61bce68752ab0206d35b28c79f4eebb0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4305404.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4305404/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host dengue dynamics","secondary dengue infections","host viral dynamics of dengue infections","viral clearance rate","clearance of infected cells","onset of severe disease","innate immune response","host dengue models of increasing complexity","primary symptomatic dengue infection","manifestation of severe disease","adaptive immune response","viral load","characteristic features","mathematical models","general role of immune cells","infected cell clearance","secondary heterologous infections","contribution of T cells","higher rate of viral infectivity","well-characterized features of primary","increased risk of disease","minimal models","virological indicators","cytokine storm","magnitude of peak viraemia","suite of mathematical","critical components","simple target cell limited model","indicative of antibody","dependent enhancement","time","reproduction","result","ones","focus","aspects","recent years","relationship","effectiveness","progress"],"language":"en"},

We report key themes from an agenda-setting, multi-disciplinary roundtable convened to examine experiences and implications for health systems in Ghana, a nation without cases but where risk for spread is high and the economic, social and political impact of the impending threat is already felt. DISCUSSION: Participants\u2019 personal stories and the broader debates to define fundamental issues and opportunities for preparedness focused on three inter-related themes. First, the dangers of the fear response itself were highlighted as a threat to the integrity and continuity of quality care. Second, healthcare workers\u2019 fears were compounded by a demonstrable lack of societal and personal protections for infection prevention and control in communities and healthcare facilities, as evidenced by an ongoing cholera epidemic affecting over 20,000 patients in the capital Accra alone since June 2014. Third, a lack of coherent messaging and direction from leadership seems to have limited coordination and reinforced a level of mistrust in the government\u2019s ability and commitment to mobilize an adequate response. Initial recommendations include urgent investment in the needed supplies and infrastructure for basic, routine infection control in communities and healthcare facilities, provision of assurances with securities for frontline healthcare workers, establishment of a multi-sector, \u201Call-hazards\u201D outbreak surveillance system, and engaging directly with key community groups to co-produce contextually relevant educational messages that will help decrease stigma, fear, and the demoralizing perception that the disease defies remedy or control. SUMMARY: The EVD epidemic provides an unprecedented opportunity for West African countries not yet affected by EVD cases to make progress on tackling long-standing health systems weaknesses. This roundtable discussion emphasized the urgent need to strengthen capacity for infection control, occupational health and safety, and leadership coordination. Significant commitment is needed to raise standards of hygiene in communities and health facilities, build mechanisms for collaboration across sectors, and engage community stakeholders in creating the needed solutions. It would be both devastating and irresponsible to waste the opportunity.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nyarko, Yaw; Goldfrank, Lewis; Ogedegbe, Gbenga; Soghoian, Sari; de-Graft Aikins, Ama","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57f6dcd04aa7aacdfa5e1c1e23f7ba396b67d0ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4363361.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4363361/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola Virus Disease","EVD"],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["health facilities","healthcare facilities","communities","EVD epidemic","routine infection control","occupational health","EVD cases","infection prevention","West African countries","frontline healthcare workers","long-standing health systems weaknesses","healthcare workers\u2019 fears","leadership coordination","needed supplies","roundtable discussion","key themes","needed solutions","fear response","multi-disciplinary roundtable","key community groups","ongoing cholera epidemic","personal protections","multi-sector","urgent investment","urgent need","social fabric","community stakeholders","unprecedented opportunity","limited coordination","impending threat","Significant commitment","adequate response","affected people","Participants\u2019 personal stories","demonstrable lack of societal","lack of coherent messaging","inter-related themes","current Ebola Virus Disease","co-produce","securities","infrastructure","broader debates","provision of assurances","preparedness","all-hazards","establishment","agenda-setting","experiences","progress","capacity","relevant educational messages","safety","opportunities","fundamental issues","patients","level of mistrust","direction","political impact","Ghana","implications","collaboration","mechanisms","outbreak surveillance system","government\u2019s ability","demoralizing perception","standards of hygiene","integrity","spread","risk","stigma","sectors","BACKGROUND","remedy","Initial recommendations","continuity of quality care","capital Accra","dangers"],"language":"en"},

F4/AS01 consists of F4 recombinant fusion protein (containing clade B Gag/p24, Pol/RT, Nef and Gag/p17) formulated in AS01 Adjuvant System, and was shown to induce F4-specific polyfunctional CD4(\u002B) T-cell responses in humans. While replication-incompetent recombinant HIV-1/SIV antigen-expressing human adenoviral vectors can elicit high-frequency antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses, their use is hampered by widespread pre-existing immunity to human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus serotypes associated with lower prevalence may offer an alternative strategy. We evaluated the immunogenicity of AdC7-GRN (\u2018A\u2019), a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 vector expressing clade B Gag, RT and Nef, and F4/AS01 (\u2018P\u2019), when delivered intramuscularly in homologous (PP or AA) and heterologous (AAPP or PPAA) prime-boost regimens, in macaques and mice. Vaccine-induced HIV-1-antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood (macaques), liver, spleen, and intestinal and genital mucosa (mice) were characterized by intracellular cytokine staining. Vaccine-specific IgG antibodies (macaques) were detected using ELISA. In macaques, only the heterologous prime-boost regimens induced polyfunctional, persistent and balanced CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses specific to each HIV-1 vaccine antigen. AdC7-GRN priming increased the polyfunctionality of F4/AS01-induced CD4(\u002B) T cells. Approximately 50% of AdC7-GRN-induced memory CD8(\u002B) T cells exhibited an effector-memory phenotype. HIV-1-specific antibodies were detected with each regimen. In mice, antigen-specific CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses were detected in the mucosal and systemic anatomical compartments assessed. When administered in heterologous prime-boost regimens, AdC7-GRN and F4/AS01 candidate vaccines acted complementarily in inducing potent and persistent peripheral blood HIV-1-specific CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses and antibodies in macaques. Besides, adenoviral vector priming modulated the cytokine-expression profile of the protein-induced CD4(\u002B) T cells.

This suggests that prime-boost regimens combining adjuvanted protein and low-seroprevalent chimpanzee adenoviral vectors represent an attractive vaccination strategy for clinical evaluation.","publish_time":"2015-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorin, Clarisse; Vanloubbeeck, Yannick; Baudart, S\u00E9bastien; Ska, Micha\u00EBl; Bayat, Babak; Brauers, Geoffroy; Clarinval, G\u00E9raldine; Donner, Marie-No\u00EBlle; Marchand, Martine; Koutsoukos, Marguerite; Mettens, Pascal; Cohen, Joe; Voss, Gerald","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0f627b8e856fdf97cf414ac42f3536ff1a33134.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4391709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4391709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT","PPAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cell responses specific","specific T-cell responses","antigen-specific T cells","antigen-specific CD4","specific antibodies","F4-specific polyfunctional CD4","T lymphocytes","AS01-induced CD4","Vaccine-induced HIV","protein-induced CD4","regimen induced HIV","macaques","induced memory CD8","high-frequency antigen-specific CD8","Vaccine-specific IgG antibodies","balanced CD4","vaccine antigen","mice","heterologous prime-boost regimens","polyfunctionality of F4","persistent peripheral blood HIV","replication-incompetent recombinant HIV","AdC7-GRN priming","F4 recombinant fusion protein","SIV antigen","human adenoviral vectors","human serotypes","immunogenicity of AdC7","clade B Gag","AS01 candidate vaccines","AS01 Adjuvant System","adjuvanted protein","recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type","Nef","Non-human adenovirus serotypes","low-seroprevalent chimpanzee adenoviral vectors","alternative strategy","replication control","attractive vaccination strategy","cytokine-expression profile","effector-memory phenotype","systemic anatomical compartments","intracellular cytokine staining","lower prevalence","p24","p17","use","spleen","widespread pre-existing immunity","liver","AAPP","PPAA","local tissues","clinical evaluation","genital mucosa","humans","ELISA"],"language":"en"},

In Brazil, SIV has been identified in pigs since 1978. After the emergence of pandemic H1N1 in 2009 (H1N1pdm09), few studies reported the presence of influenza virus in Brazilian herds. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the serological profile for influenza virus in farrow-to-finish pig farms in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. METHODS: Thirty farms with no SIV vaccination history were selected from the four larger pig production areas in Minas Gerais state (Zona da Mata, Tri\u00E2ngulo Mineiro/Alto Parana\u00EDba, South/Southwest and the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area). At each farm, blood samples were randomly collected from 20 animals in each production cycle category: breeding animals (sows and gilts), farrowing crate (2\u20133 weeks), nursery (4\u20137 weeks), grower pigs (8\u201314 weeks), and finishing pigs (15\u201316 weeks), with 100 samples per farm and a total of 3000 animals in this study. The samples were tested for hemagglutination inhibition activity against H1N1 pandemic strain (A/swine/Brazil/11/2009) and H3N2 SIV (A/swine/Iowa/8548-2/98) reference strain. RESULTS: The percentages of seropositive animals for H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 were 26\u00B723% and 1\u00B757%, respectively, and the percentages of seropositive herds for both viruses were 96\u00B76% and 13\u00B72%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The serological profiles differed for both viruses and among the studied areas, suggesting a high variety of virus circulation around the state, as well as the presence of seronegative animals susceptible to influenza infection and, consequently, new respiratory disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2015-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dias, Alessandra S; Costa, \u00C9rica A; Raj\u00E3o, Daniela S; Guedes, Roberto M C; Ciacci Zanella, Janice R; Lobato, Z\u00E9lia I P","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd31ade73c720f893a5ddb2370df90a84511ec4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4415701.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4415701/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","Minas Gerais"],"keyphrases":["Swine influenza virus","weeks","presence of influenza virus","breeding animals","percentages of seropositive animals","H3N2 SIV","influenza infection","Minas Gerais state","presence of seronegative animals susceptible","H1N1 pandemic strain","SIV vaccination history","percentages of seropositive herds","viruses","H1N1pdm09","study","blood samples","grower pigs","larger pig production areas","high variety of virus circulation","finish pig farms","emergence of pandemic H1N1","acute respiratory disease","studied areas","new respiratory disease outbreaks","serological profiles","Brazilian herds","reference strain","production cycle category","Mata","Southwest","sows","Zona","Tri\u00E2ngulo Mineiro","Alto Parana\u00EDba","hemagglutination inhibition activity","gilts","cause","Belo Horizonte metropolitan area","farrowing crate","total","studies","BACKGROUND","Iowa","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","nursery"],"language":"en"},

Small exogenous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as siRNA and shRNA are the active silencing agents, intended to target and cleave complementary mRNAs in a specific way. They are widely and successfully employed in functional studies, and several ongoing and already completed siRNA-based clinical trials suggest encouraging results in the regulation of overexpressed genes in disease. siRNAs share many aspects of their biogenesis and function with miRNAs, small ncRNA molecules transcribed from endogenous genes which are able to repress the expression of target mRNAs by either inhibiting their translation or promoting their degradation. Although siRNA and artificial miRNA molecules can significantly reduce the expression of overexpressed target genes, cancer and other diseases can also be triggered or sustained by upregulated miRNAs. Thus, in the past recent years, molecular tools for miRNA silencing, such as antagomiRs and miRNA sponges, have been developed. These molecules have shown their efficacy in the derepression of genes downregulated by overexpressed miRNAs. In particular, while a single antagomiR is able to inhibit a single complementary miRNA, an artificial sponge construct usually contains one or more binding sites for one or more miRNAs and functions by competing with the natural targets of these miRNAs. As a consequence, natural miRNA targets are reexpressed at their physiological level. In this chapter we review the most successful methods for the computational design of siRNAs, antagomiRs, and miRNA sponges and describe the most popular tools that implement them.","publish_time":"2014-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lagan\u00E0, Alessandro; Veneziano, Dario; Russo, Francesco; Pulvirenti, Alfredo; Giugno, Rosalba; Croce, Carlo Maria; Ferro, Alfredo","journal":"RNA Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["miRNA silencing","miRNA sponges","overexpressed miRNAs","artificial miRNA molecules","single complementary miRNA","natural miRNA targets","expression of overexpressed target genes","regulation of overexpressed genes","upregulated miRNAs","expression of target mRNAs","endogenous genes","derepression of genes","small ncRNA molecules","antagomiRs","regulation of gene expression","complementary mRNAs","natural targets","molecular tools","single antagomiR","popular tools","computational design of siRNAs","artificial sponge construct","active silencing agents","Small exogenous noncoding RNAs","ncRNAs","encouraging results","powerful tool","shRNA","past recent years","biogenesis","cancer","successful methods","clinical trials","RNAi","aspects","specific way","translation","efficacy","diseases","functions","consequence","RNA interference","binding sites","physiological level","functional studies","chapter","degradation"],"language":"en"},

The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated morbidity and mortality makes vaccine development a priority. Methods. As part of an efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines (NCT01051661), RSV epidemiology in healthy children aged 6 months to \u003C10 years at first vaccination with influenza-like illness (ILI) was evaluated in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand between February 2010 and August 2011. Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year, with nasal and throat swabs analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence and incidence of RSV among ILI episodes were calculated. Results. A total of 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes with a respiratory sample available. RSV was detected for 359 ILI episodes, a prevalence of 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.7\u201310.7). The highest prevalence was in children aged 12\u201323 or 24\u201335 months in all countries except the Philippines, where it was in children aged 6\u201311 months. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI was 7.0 (6.3\u20137.7) per 100 person-years (PY). Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV (prevalence 9.1% [4.0\u201317.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1\u20130.3] per 100 PY). The incidence of RSV-associated ILI resulting in medical attendance was 6.0 (5.4\u20136.7) per 100 PY. RSV B subtypes were observed more frequently than A subtypes. Conclusions. Active surveillance demonstrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance, with a substantial part of the burden occurring in older infants and children.","publish_time":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nolan, Terry; Borja-Tabora, Charissa; Lopez, Pio; Weckx, Lily; Ulloa-Gutierrez, Rolando; Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo; Kerdpanich, Angkool; Weber, Miguel Angel Rodriguez; Mascare\u00F1as de Los Santos, Abiel; Tinoco, Juan-Carlos; Safadi, Marco Aurelio P.; Seng, Lim Fong; Hernandez-de Mezerville, Marcela; Faingezicht, Idis; Cruz-Valdez, Aurelio; Feng, Yang; Li, Ping; Durviaux, Serge; Haars, Gerco; Roy-Ghanta, Sumita; Vaughn, David W.; Taylor, Sylvia","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b9992937c24368f15eb03e7009ba85beadab1e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4429758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4429758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","Philippines, Singapore","ILI"],"locations":["Australia","Brazil","Colombia","Mexico","Thailand","Philippines"],"keyphrases":["associated ILI","incidence of RSV","ILI episodes","RSV epidemiology","considerable burden of RSV","RSV B subtypes","associated illness","associated morbidity","healthy children","months","PY","Active surveillance","highest prevalence","Philippines","hospital-based surveillance","high burden of respiratory syncytial virus","person-years","respiratory sample available","efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines","NCT01051661","throat swabs","mortality","Costa Rica","Colombia","Mexico","vaccine development","polymerase chain reaction","Brazil","Australia","medical attendance","priority","Singapore","vaccination","older infants","Thailand","countries","hospitalization","confidence interval","total","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The catalyzed assembly process produces a large amount of G-rich DNA. In the presence of hemin, the G-rich DNA forms G-quadruplex/hemin complex and mimic horseradish peroxidase activity, which catalyzes a colorimetric reaction.

Importantly, this method demonstrates excellent assay versatility for sensitively detecting oligonucleotides or aptamer-recognized targets.","publish_time":"2015-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wenhong; Yan, Yurong; Zhang, Ye; Zhang, Xuemei; Yin, Yibing; Ding, Shijia","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90403742f692b74ea175eef945ff8560a1a6c2b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4462091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["CHA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hairpin DNA","target DNA binds","G-rich DNA forms G-quadruplex","calibration curve of synthetic target DNA","oligonucleotides","catalyzed hairpin assembly","signal transducer","pneumoniae","amplification reaction of CHA","developed method","aptamer-recognized targets","colorimetric reaction","based signal amplification","catalyzed assembly process","hemin complex","good linearity","presence of hemin","specific detection","good specificity","detection limit","versatile colorimetric biosensor","successful visual analysis","mimic horseradish peroxidase activity","related streptococci","clinical samples","wide range of biomolecules","new nucleic acid sequence","major pathogenic bacteria","excellent assay versatility","toehold","nM","optimal conditions","naked eye","addition","CFU","strategy"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the etiology of AOM in HIV-infected (HIV\u002B), HIV-uninfected (HIV\u2212) and HIV-exposed clinically asymptomatic for HIV-infection (HEU) South African children. METHODS: Children \u22653 months to \u003C5 years of age with AOM were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2010 (NCT01031082). Middle ear fluid samples were cultured for bacteria; antibacterial susceptibility was done and serotyping undertaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses using immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 260 AOM episodes (HIV\u002B:15; HIV\u2212:182; HEU:63), bacteria were found in 54.6%, including Haemophilus influenzae (30.8%), 98.8% of which were nontypeable, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5.0%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.5%). Nonsusceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin was 64.2%. Respiratory viruses were detected in 74.2% of cases. Human rhinovirus was most frequently detected (37.7%), followed by adenovirus (14.2%) and human bocavirus (11.5%) overall and irrespective of HIV status. Respiratory viruses were identified concurrently with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis (76.9\u201378.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (63.4%) cultured from middle ear fluid, as well as in 72.0% of episodes negative for any bacteria. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria play an important role in the development of AOM in children. A similar spectrum of pathogens was observed independently of HIV status. Vaccines targeting both nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae may have a broad impact on AOM in South Africa.","publish_time":"2015-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madhi, Shabir A.; Govender, Niresha; Dayal, Kishen; Devadiga, Raghavendra; Van Dyke, Melissa K.; van Niekerk, Nadia; Cutland, Clare Louise; Adrian, Peter V.; Nunes, Marta C.","journal":"Pediatr Infect Dis J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8de59f214706ec9d7e5df16bbd94f6a13aff39e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4463031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4463031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus","Streptococcus","Moraxella","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["AOM"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["HIV status","HIV-infection","HIV-infected","HIV-uninfected","respiratory viruses","AOM episodes","development of AOM","etiology of AOM","Nonsusceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae","pathogenic bacteria","nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pyogenes","HEU","South African children","Middle ear fluid samples","Staphylococcus aureus","middle income countries","Moraxella catarrhalis","Human rhinovirus","human bocavirus","immunofluorescence assay","important role","polymerase chain reaction","data","broad impact","serotyping","pathogenesis of acute otitis media","months","study","antibacterial susceptibility","years of age","penicillin","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","Vaccines","BACKGROUND","similar spectrum of pathogens","METHODS","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","adenovirus","NCT01031082","cases"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present study was to identify human leukemia antigen (HLA)-A*0201-restricted epitopes of EPS8 by using a reverse immunology approach. To achieve this, computer algorithms were used to predict HLA-A*0201 molecular binding, proteasome cleavage patterns as well as translocation of transporters associated with antigen processing. Candidate peptides were experimentally validated by T2 binding affinity assay and brefeldin-A decay assay. The functional avidity of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers were evaluated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay and a cytotoxicity assay. Four peptides, designated as P455, P92, P276 and P360, had high affinity and stability of binding towards the HLA-A*0201 molecule, and specific CTLs induced by them significantly responded to the corresponding peptides and secreted IFN-\u03B3. At the same time, the CTLs were able to specifically lyse EPS8-expressing cell lines in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner.

Early diagnosis of DF helps to diminish its burden on public health. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase amplification assays (RT-PCR) are the standard method for molecular detection of the dengue virus (DENV). Real-time RT-PCR analysis is not suitable for on-site screening since mobile devices are large, expensive, and complex. In this study, two RT-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assays were developed to detect DENV1-4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using two quantitative RNA molecular standards, the analytical sensitivity of a RT-RPA targeting the 3\u00B4non-translated region of DENV1-4 was found to range from 14 (DENV4) to 241 (DENV1-3) RNA molecules detected. The assay was specific and did not cross detect other Flaviviruses. The RT-RPA assay was tested in a mobile laboratory combining magnetic-bead based total nucleic acid extraction and a portable detection device in Kedougou (Senegal) and in Bangkok (Thailand). In Kedougou, the RT-RPA was operated at an ambient temperature of 38\u00B0C with auxiliary electricity tapped from a motor vehicle and yielded a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 98% (n=31) and 100% (n=23), respectively. While in the field trial in Bangkok, the clinical sensitivity and specificity were 72% (n=90) and 100%(n=41), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During the first 5 days of infection, the developed DENV1-4 RT-RPA assays constitute a suitable accurate and rapid assay for DENV diagnosis. Moreover, the use of a portable fluorescence-reading device broadens its application potential to the point-of-care for outbreak investigations.","publish_time":"2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Patel, Pranav; Faye, Oumar; Thaloengsok, Sasikanya; Heidenreich, Doris; Matangkasombut, Ponpan; Manopwisedjaroen, Khajohnpong; Sakuntabhai, Anavaj; Sall, Amadou A.; Hufert, Frank T.; Weidmann, Manfred","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05f2d4c337413ae496e31e2259020f3e328dcfa1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4468249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4468249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DF","DENV"],"locations":["Bangkok","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["RT-RPA assays","RT-recombinase polymerase amplification","Real-time RT-PCR analysis","developed DENV1","clinical sensitivity","molecular detection","portable detection device","analytical sensitivity","rapid assay","Bangkok","DENV diagnosis","Kedougou","specificity","Real-time reverse transcription polymerase amplification assays","non-translated region of DENV1","Early diagnosis of DF","mobile devices","mobile laboratory","quantitative RNA molecular standards","portable fluorescence","dengue virus","RNA molecules","risk of contracting dengue fever","total nucleic acid extraction","magnetic-bead","on-site screening","Senegal","motor vehicle","standard method","auxiliary electricity","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","point","application potential","ambient temperature","field trial","days of infection","care","burden","study","outbreak investigations","public health","SIGNIFICANCE","people","METHODOLOGY","Thailand","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Flaviviruses","DENV4"],"language":"en"},

The resistance caused by mutations can be circumvented since the mutations that cause the loss of function also incapacitate the virus. Many pathogens encode proteases that are essential for their replication and that have a defined substrate specificity. A genetically encoded sensor composed of a fused membrane anchor, viral protease target site, and an orthogonal transcriptional activator was engineered into a human cell line. The HIV-1 protease released the transcriptional activator from the membrane, thereby inducing transcription of the selected genes. The device was still strongly activated by clinically relevant protease mutants that are resistant to protease inhibitors.

Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus. RESULTS: Nucleotide composition and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed that MARV shows mutation bias and prefers U- and A-ended codons to code amino acids. Effective number of codons analysis indicated that overall codon usage among MARV genomes is slightly biased. The Parity Rule 2 plot analysis showed that GC and AU nucleotides were not used proportionally which accounts for the presence of natural selection. Codon usage patterns of MARV were also found to be influenced by its hosts. This indicates that MARV have evolved codon usage patterns that are specific to both of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from R. aegyptiacus on the MARV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from H. sapiens. Overall, mutation pressure was found to be the most important and dominant force that shapes codon usage patterns in MARV. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed codon usage analysis of MARV and extends our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to codon usage and evolution of MARV.

To survey the prevalence of tick-borne known and putative pathogens, we tested 982 individual adult and nymphal I. pacificus ticks collected throughout California between 2007 and 2009 using a broad-range PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) assay designed to detect a wide range of tick-borne microorganisms. Overall, 1.4% of the ticks were found to be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, 2.0% were infected with Borrelia miyamotoi and 0.3% were infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In addition, 3.0% were infected with Babesia odocoilei. About 1.2% of the ticks were co-infected with more than one pathogen or putative pathogen. In addition, we identified a novel Anaplasmataceae species that we characterized by sequencing of its 16S rRNA, groEL, gltA, and rpoB genes. Sequence analysis indicated that this organism is phylogenetically distinct from known Anaplasma species with its closest genetic near neighbors coming from Asia. The prevalence of this novel Anaplasmataceae species was as high as 21% at one site, and it was detected in 4.9% of ticks tested statewide.

We have previously shown that P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a cell death receptor, is specifically expressed in alveolar epithelial type I cells (AEC I). In this study, we hypothesized that P2X7R-mediated purinergic signaling and its interaction with Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling contributes to AEC I death. We examined the effect of P2X7R agonist 2\u2032-3\u2032-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) and Wnt agonist Wnt3a on AEC I death in vitro and in vivo. We also assessed the therapeutic potential of Wnt3a in a clinically relevant ALI model of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure in ventilated mice. We found that the activation of P2X7R by BzATP caused the death of AEC I by suppressing Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling through stimulating glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03B2 (GSK-3\u03B2) and proteasome. On the other hand, the activation of Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling by Wnt3a, GSK-3\u03B2 inhibitor, or proteasome inhibitor blocked the P2X7R-mediated cell death. More importantly, Wnt3a attenuated the AEC I damage caused by intratracheal instillation of BzATP in rats or LPS in ventilated mice. Our results suggest that Wnt3a overrides the effect of P2X7R on the Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling to prevent the AEC I death and restrict the severity of ALI.","publish_time":"2014-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Y; Mishra, A; Weng, T; Chintagari, N R; Wang, Y; Zhao, C; Huang, C; Liu, L","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53d42460cf7381eb4384560e4cdb2574178a2309.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4611727.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4611727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AEC I death","death of AEC","\u03B2-catenin","\u03B2 inhibitor","P2X7R-mediated cell death","Wnt agonist Wnt3a","activation of P2X7R","cell death receptor","activation of Wnt","effect of P2X7R agonist","epithelial cell damage","therapeutic potential of Wnt3a","LPS","intratracheal instillation of BzATP","GSK","proteasome inhibitor","severity of ALI","ventilated mice","alveolar epithelial type","relevant ALI model of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide","P2X7 receptor","loss","rats","stimulating glycogen synthase kinase","exposure","interaction","capillary barrier","Acute lung injury","benzoylbenzoyl","results","hand","study"],"language":"en"},

In this work, the origin of the long-term storage stability and sustained NO release mechanism of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine (SNAP)-doped CarboSil 20 80A polymer, a biomedical thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate-urethane, is explored. Long-term (22 days) localized NO release is achieved by utilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber as topcoats, which can greatly reduce the amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching from the SNAP-doped CarboSil films, as measured by LC\u2013MS. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction characterization of SNAP-doped CarboSil films demonstrate that a polymer\u2013crystal composite is formed during the solvent evaporation process when SNAP exceeds its solubility in CarboSil (ca. 3.4\u20134.0 wt %). Further, when exceeding this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic crystal form within the bulk of the polymer. The proposed mechanism of sustained NO release in SNAP-doped CarboSil is that the solubilized SNAP in the polymer matrix decomposes and releases NO, primarily in the water-rich regions near the polymer/solution interface, and the dissolved SNAP in the bulk polymeric phase becomes unsaturated, resulting in the dissolution of crystalline SNAP within the bulk of the polymer. This is a very slow process that ultimately leads to NO release at the physiological flux levels for \u003E3 weeks. The increased stability of SNAP within CarboSil is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the SNAP molecules that crystallize. This crystallization also plays a key role in maintaining RSNO stability within the CarboSil polymer for \u003E8 months at 37 \u00B0C (88.5% remains). Further, intravascular catheters fabricated with this new material are demonstrated to significantly decrease the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections) (in vitro) over a 7 day period, with 5 log units reduction of viable cell count on catheter surfaces. It is also shown that the NO release catheters can greatly reduce thrombus formation on the catheter surfaces during 7 h implantation in rabbit veins, when compared to the control catheters fabricated without SNAP. These results suggest that the SNAP-doped CarboSil system is a very attractive new composite material for creating long-term NO release medical devices with increased stability and biocompatibility.","publish_time":"2015-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wo, Yaqi; Li, Zi; Brisbois, Elizabeth J.; Colletta, Alessandro; Wu, Jianfeng; Major, Terry C.; Xi, Chuanwu; Bartlett, Robert H.; Matzger, Adam J.; Meyerhoff, Mark E.","journal":"ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c289f35b5482b7a6d778503a6360704d59cbc7da.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bafafd9f8218f31163be864df6a1a0681ad0d16c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4613868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4613868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Raman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dissolved SNAP","solubilized SNAP","SNAP molecules","CarboSil polymer","SNAP-doped CarboSil films","SNAP-doped CarboSil system","increased stability of SNAP","dissolution of crystalline SNAP","release catheters","polymer matrix","powder X-ray diffraction characterization of SNAP","release mechanism of S","release medical devices","long-term storage stability","RSNO stability","catheter surfaces","new material","crystal composite","intravascular catheters","control catheters","attractive new composite material","bulk polymeric phase","biomedical thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate","thrombus formation","NAP disulfide","proposed mechanism","solubility threshold","slow process","orthorhombic crystal form","potential biomedical applications","solvent evaporation process","cross-linked silicone rubber","formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm","localized delivery of nitric oxide","log units reduction of viable cell count","Raman spectroscopy","nitroso-N","penicillamine","antimicrobial agent","leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections","acetyl-d","solution interface","h implantation","LC","intermolecular hydrogen bonds","water-rich regions","rabbit veins","text","key role","urethane","physiological flux levels","biocompatibility","origin","day period","weeks","topcoats","releases","months","crystallization","Image","work","days","results","wt"],"language":"en"},

Earlier we showed that mutants unable to form the side chain at position 5 (ncm(5) or mcm(5)) or lacking sulphur at position 2 (s(2)) of U(34) result in pleiotropic phenotypes, which are all suppressed by overexpression of hypomodified tRNAs. This observation suggests that the observed phenotypes are due to inefficient reading of cognate codons or an increased frameshifting. The latter may be caused by a ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA*eEF1A*GTP) with a modification deficient tRNA inefficiently being accepted to the ribosomal A-site and thereby allowing an increased peptidyl-tRNA slippage and thus a frameshift error. In this study, we have investigated the role of wobble uridine modifications in reading frame maintenance, using either the Renilla/Firefly luciferase bicistronic reporter system or a modified Ty1 frameshifting site in a HIS4A::lacZ reporter system.

It is expected that inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide aerosol) may prevent the development of hypoxemia or fat embolism syndrome in high-risk patients by reducing this inflammatory response. Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) steroid preparations can reach the lung parenchyma with minimal systemic effect. Sixty cases of polytrauma patients presenting within eight hours of injury were randomly allocated into one of the two groups.

METHODS: We exposed infant mice to C. leptum (fed-CL) and then induced asthma using the allergen ovalbumin (OVA). RESULTS: Fed-CL increased regulatory T (Treg) cells in cesarean-delivered mice compared with vaginally delivered mice. Compared with OVA-exposed mice, mice exposed to C. leptum \u002B OVA did not develop the typical asthma phenotype, which includes airway hyper-responsiveness, cell infiltration, and T helper cell subset (Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17) inflammation. Early-life C. leptum exposure induced an immunosuppressive environment in the lung concurrent with increased Treg cells, resulting in the inhibition of Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 cell responses. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate a mechanism whereby C. leptum exposure modulates adaptive immunity and leads to failure to develop asthma upon OVA sensitization later in life.","publish_time":"2015-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Fei; Qiao, Hong-mei; Yin, Jia-ning; Gao, Yang; Ju, Yang-hua; Li, Ya-nan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bd0d5db60f72689e429b6f1e98678d789930366.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4643994.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643994/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzcyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OVA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leptum exposure","OVA-exposed mice","leptum deficiency","infant mice","life","development of asthma","asthma development","Low Clostridium leptum levels","typical asthma phenotype","OVA sensitization","cell infiltration","Th2","Th9","Th17 cell responses","cesarean","increased Treg cells","fed","effects of early","impact of early","T helper cell subset","regulatory T","inhibition of Th1","risk factor","airway hyper-responsiveness","lung concurrent","immunosuppressive environment","failure","mechanism","adaptive immunity","INTRODUCTION","findings","inflammation","allergen ovalbumin","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","METHODS","study"],"language":"en"},

Porcine Interleukin-4 (pIL-4) plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response and has been used previously as an immunological adjuvant. The objective of this study was to construct a recombinant PRRSV expressing pIL-4 and to evaluate the immune response of the recombinant virus in piglets. METHODS: The pIL-4 gene was inserted in the PRRSV (CH-1R strain) infectious clone by overlap PCR. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting were used to confirm the recombinant virus. The stability of the recombinant virus was assessed by DNA sequencing and IFA after 15 passages in vitro. Recombinant virus was injected into pigs and efficacy of immune protection was evaluated in comparison with the parental virus. RESULTS: The recombinant virus (CH-1R/pIL-4) was successfully rescued and shown to have similar growth kinetics as the parental virus. The recombinant virus was stable for 15 passages in cell culture. Pigs vaccinated with CH-1R/pIL-4 produced a similar humoral response to the response elicited by parental virus, but IL-4 level in the supernatant of PBMCs from pigs vaccinated with CH-1R/pIL-4 was significantly higher than the parent virus at 28 days post-immunization (DPI). Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis showed that the percentage of CD4(\u002B)CD8(\u002B) double positive T (DPT) cells in the CH-1R/pIL-4 vaccinated group was significantly higher than the parental virus at 3 and 7 Days Post-Challenge (DPC), and the IL-4 level in the blood significantly increased at 7 DPC. However, the viral load and histopathology did not show significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A recombinant PRRSV expressing porcine IL-4 was rescued and it remained genetically stable in vitro. The recombinant virus induced higher DPT ratios and IL-4 levels in the blood after HP-PRRSV challenge compared to the parental virus in piglets. However, it did not significantly improve protection efficacy of PRRSV vaccine.","publish_time":"2015-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhijun; Wang, Gang; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Chong; Wang, Xinglong; Huang, Baicheng; Li, Qiongyi; Li, Liangliang; Xue, Biyun; Ding, Peiyang; Syed, Shahid Faraz; Wang, Chengbao; Cai, Xuehui; Zhou, En-Min","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/defb2baddf8a312718647fac6a0860606ff8907d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4647277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647277/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzcyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFA","DPT","DPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant virus","parental virus","recombinant PRRSV","parent virus","pIL","respiratory syndrome virus","porcine IL","immune response","HP-PRRSV challenge","protection efficacy of PRRSV vaccine","R strain","various strains of PRRSV","pigs","efficacy of immune protection","similar humoral response","higher DPT ratios","IFA","Days Post-Challenge","broad protection","passages","blood","Porcine Interleukin","DPC","piglets","vaccinated group","days post-immunization","similar growth kinetics","cells","current vaccines","analysis","CD8","double positive T","levels","infection","DNA sequencing","infectious clone","histopathology","FCM","Indirect immunofluorescence assay","Western blotting","regulation","supernatant of PBMCs","comparison","significant difference","percentage of CD4","Flow cytometric","PCR","BACKGROUND","cell culture","important role","gene","study","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","viral load","groups","METHODS","stability","immunological adjuvant","objective"],"language":"en"},

Like other herpesviruses, multiple processes required for KSHV lytic replication, including viral transcription, viral DNA synthesis and capsid assembly occur in virus-induced intranuclear structures, termed replication and transcription compartments (RTCs). Here we utilised a novel methodology, combining subcellular fractionation and quantitative proteomics, to identify cellular proteins which are recruited to KSHV-induced RTCs and thus play a key role in KSHV lytic replication. We show that several isoforms of the HSP70 chaperone family, Hsc70 and iHsp70, are redistributed from the cytoplasm into the nucleus coinciding with the initial formation of KSHV-induced RTCs. We demonstrate that nuclear chaperone foci are dynamic, initially forming adjacent to newly formed KSHV RTCs, however during later time points the chaperones move within KSHV RTCs and completely co-localise with actively replicating viral DNA. The functional significance of Hsp70 isoforms recruitment into KSHV RTCs was also examined using the specific Hsp70 isoform small molecule inhibitor, VER-155008. Intriguingly, results highlight an essential role of Hsp70 isoforms in the KSHV replication cycle independent of protein stability and maturation. Notably, inhibition of Hsp70 isoforms precluded KSHV RTC formation and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) relocalisation to the viral genome leading to the abolishment of global KSHV transcription and subsequent viral protein synthesis and DNA replication. These new findings have revealed novel mechanisms that regulate KSHV lytic replication and highlight the potential of HSP70 inhibitors as novel antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2015-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baquero-P\u00E9rez, Belinda; Whitehouse, Adrian","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/717168e782bf72b65add057c1cebe8d1bfdffbda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4654589.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4654589/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzczNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KSHV","KSHV RTC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KSHV lytic replication","KSHV-induced RTCs","formed KSHV RTCs","KSHV RTC formation","initial formation of KSHV","DNA replication","abolishment of global KSHV transcription","viral transcription","KSHV replication cycle independent of protein stability","inhibition of Hsp70 isoforms","termed replication","viral DNA synthesis","essential role of Hsp70 isoforms","viral genome","HSP70 chaperone family","potential of HSP70 inhibitors","functional significance of Hsp70 isoforms recruitment","subsequent viral protein synthesis","transcription compartments","novel mechanisms","novel methodology","specific Hsp70 isoform small molecule inhibitor","novel antiviral agents","key role","oncogenic herpesvirus","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","nuclear chaperone foci","RNA polymerase","RNAPII","intranuclear structures","capsid assembly","quantitative proteomics","subcellular fractionation","relocalisation","VER","iHsp70","later time","multiple processes","various AIDS-related malignancies","maturation","cellular proteins","Hsc70","chaperones","nucleus","new findings","herpesviruses","results","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

While the magnitude of tissue neutrophil accumulation in innate immune responses is profoundly greater in males than females, fundamental aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain largely unknown. METHODS: We investigated sex differences in neutrophil stimulation and recruitment in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R; mesenteric or renal) or carrageenan pleurisy in rats or mice, as well as skin injury in human volunteers. The induction of potent chemoattractive mediators (chemokines) and neutrophil adhesion molecules were measured by real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and protein assays. RESULTS: Mesenteric I/R in age-matched Wistar rats resulted in substantially more neutrophil accumulation and tissue injury at 2 h reperfusion in males than females. Using intravital microscopy, we show that the immediate (\u003C30 min) neutrophil response to I/R is similar in males and females but that prolonged neutrophil recruitment occurs in males at sites local and distal to inflammatory insult partly due to an increase in circulating neutrophil populations with elevated surface expression of adhesion molecules. Sex differences in neutrophil kinetics were correlated with sustained induction of chemokine Cxcl5 in the tissue, circulation, and bone marrow of males but not females. Furthermore, blockade of Cxcl5 in males prior to ischemia resulted in neutrophil responses that were similar in magnitude to those in females. Conversely, administration of Cxcl5 to males in the absence of I/R was sufficient to increase levels of systemic neutrophils. Cxcl5 treatment of bone marrow neutrophils in vitro caused substantial induction of neutrophil-mobilizing cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and expression of \u03B22 integrin that accounts for sexual dimorphism in circulating neutrophil populations in I/R. Moreover, male Cxcl5-stimulated bone marrow neutrophils had an increased capacity to adhere to \u03B22 integrin ligand ICAM-1, implicating a greater sensitivity of male leukocytes to Cxcl5-mediated activation. Differential induction of Cxcl5 (human CXCL6) between the sexes was also evident in murine renal I/R, rat pleurisy, and human skin blisters and correlated with the magnitude of neutrophil accumulation in tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that sex-specific induction of chemokine Cxcl5/CXCL6 contributes to sexual dimorphism in neutrophil recruitment in diverse acute inflammatory responses partly due to increased stimulation and trafficking of bone marrow neutrophils in males.

Live poultry markets, density of human, coverage of built-up land, relative humidity and precipitation were significant predictors for both. In addition, density of poultry, coverage of shrub and temperature played important roles for human H7N9 infection, whereas human H5N1 infection was associated with coverage of forest and water body.

In spite of this high medical relevance, neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available. DENV elicits a strong interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, but at the same time actively counteracts IFN production and signaling. Although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease, quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how DENV spreads in IFN-competent cell systems. To dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level, we generated a fully viable reporter DENV and host cells with authentic reporters for IFN-stimulated antiviral genes. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic. Even at high-dose, IFN does not fully protect all cells in the culture and, therefore, viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of na\u00EFve cells by IFN. By contrast, a vaccine candidate DENV mutant, which lacks 2\u2019-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. Through mathematical modeling of time-resolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of IFN production. This rapid induction triggered by mutant DENV precedes establishment of IFN-resistance in infected cells, thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate. In contrast, accelerated protection of na\u00EFve cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. In conclusion, these results show that attenuation of the 2\u2019-O-methylation DENV mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine IFN action on infected cells.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmid, Bianca; Rinas, Melanie; Ruggieri, Alessia; Acosta, Eliana Gisela; Bartenschlager, Marie; Reuter, Antje; Fischl, Wolfgang; Harder, Nathalie; Bergeest, Jan-Philip; Flossdorf, Michael; Rohr, Karl; H\u00F6fer, Thomas; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32218139d22cdbdbf2f41f043b08a3922ab7f327.json; document_parses/pdf_json/db84b748e88449893a5a19327b27f87fce353353.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4697809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-competent cells","establishment of IFN","IFN controls DENV infection","infected cells","mutant DENV","paracrine IFN action","accelerated kinetics of IFN production","IFN-stimulated antiviral genes","host cells","kinetics of autocrine IFN action","IFN-competent cell systems","DENV spreads","O-methylation DENV mutant","face of antiviral protection of na\u00EFve cells","accelerated protection of na\u00EFve cells","vaccine candidate DENV mutant","viable reporter DENV","antiviral therapy","innate antiviral defense","single cell level","kinetics of activation","attenuation","viral RNA","contrast","viral spread","Dengue virus","massive reduction of virus production rate","timing of viral counteraction","magnitude of infection","high-dose","common mosquito-transmitted virus infecting","high medical relevance","mathematical modeling of time","authentic reporters","disease","data","primary determinant","response","manner","resistance","validation experiments","negligible impact","strong interferon","dynamics of replication","rapid induction","kinetic analyses","spite","people","culture","conclusion","results"],"language":"en"},

This protein is structurally assembled as double dimers. Lys-315 is the only residue which is arranged symmetrically at the diagonal subunit interfaces to interact with each other. This study found that wild-type protein had both dimers and monomers present in 2\u20134 M urea whilst only monomers of the K315A mutant were observed under the same conditions, as judged by sedimentation velocity analysis. The assembly of monomeric K315A mutant was reversible in contrast to wild-type protein. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the dissociation of primary dimers is prior to the diagonal dimers in wild-type protein. These results suggest the critical role of Lys-315 in stabilization of the diagonal dimer structure. Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) denatured wild-type or K315A mutant protein did not fold into functional protein. However, the urea dissociated monomers of K315A mutant protein in GdmCl were reversible folding through a multiple steps mechanism as measured by tryptophan and ANS fluorescence. Two partly unfolded intermediates were detected in the pathway. Refolding of the intermediates resulted in a conformation with greater amounts of hydrophobic regions exposed which was prone to the formation of protein aggregates. The formation of aggregates was not prevented by the addition of \u03B1-crystallin.

However, there are striking exceptions where an in-frame genomic deletion leads to severe pathology or protein-truncating mutations (nonsense or frame-shifting indels) manifest as mild disease. Exceptions to the dystrophin reading frame rule are usually resolved after molecular diagnosis on muscle RNA. We report a moderate/severe Becker muscular dystrophy patient with an in-frame genomic deletion of DMD exon 5. This mutation has been reported by others as resulting in Duchenne or Intermediate muscular dystrophy, and the loss of this in-frame exon in one patient led to multiple splicing events, including omission of exon 6, that disrupts the open reading frame and is consistent with a severe phenotype. The patient described has a deletion of dystrophin exon 5 that does not compromise recognition of exon 6, and although the deletion does not disrupt the reading frame, his clinical presentation is more severe than would be expected for classical Becker muscular dystrophy. We suggest that the dystrophin isoform lacking the actin-binding sequence encoded by exon 5 is compromised, reflected by the phenotype resulting from induction of this dystrophin isoform in mouse muscle in vivo. Hence, exon skipping to address DMD-causing mutations within DMD exon 5 may not yield an isoform that confers marked clinical benefit. Additional studies will be required to determine whether multi-exon skipping strategies could yield more functional dystrophin isoforms, since some BMD patients with larger in-frame deletions in this region have been reported with mild phenotypes.","publish_time":"2016-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toh, Zhi Yon Charles; Thandar Aung-Htut, May; Pinniger, Gavin; Adams, Abbie M.; Krishnaswarmy, Sudarsan; Wong, Brenda L.; Fletcher, Sue; Wilton, Steve D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/593333395be3bd94387b4e273cc8ed13b398d5c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4706350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Becker"],"organizations":["DMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frame exon","deletion of dystrophin exon","frame genomic deletion of DMD exon","dystrophin open reading frame","frame rule","frame deletions","omission of exon","multi-exon","recognition of exon","severe Becker muscular dystrophy patient","Becker muscular dystrophy severity","Intermediate muscular dystrophy","classical Becker muscular dystrophy","severe phenotype","functional dystrophin isoforms","severe pathology","DMD gene lesion","Duchenne","clinical presentation","mouse muscle","muscle RNA","mild disease","striking exceptions","mild phenotypes","protein-truncating mutations","marked clinical benefit","BMD patients","nature","location","indels","nonsense","multiple splicing events","strategies","loss","actin-binding sequence","molecular diagnosis","region","manifest","induction","Additional studies"],"language":"en"},

In addition, transgenic lines of model fish harboring a tissue-specific reporter have become a powerful tool for the study of biological sciences, since it is possible to visualize the dynamic expression of a specific gene in the transparent embryos. In particular, some transgenic fish lines and mutants display defective phenotypes similar to those of human diseases. Therefore, a wide variety of fish model not only sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis in vivo but also provides a living platform for high-throughput screening of drug candidates. Interestingly, transgenic model fish lines can also be applied as biosensors to detect environmental pollutants, and even as pet fish to display beautiful fluorescent colors.

However the rate of occult bacteremia in infants with RSV infection is not well established. The aim was to determine the actual rate and predictive factors of bacteremia in children admitted to hospital due to confirmed RSV acute respiratory illness (ARI), using both conventional culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: A prospective multicenter study (GENDRES-network) was conducted between 2011\u20132013 in children under the age of two admitted to hospital because of an ARI. Among those RSV-positive, bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to conventional cultures. RESULTS: 66 children with positive RSV respiratory illness were included. In 10.6% patients, bacterial presence was detected: H. influenzae (n = 4) and S. pneumoniae (n = 2). In those patients with bacteremia, there was a previous suspicion of bacterial superinfection and had received empirical antibiotic treatment 6 out of 7 (85.7%) patients. There were significant differences in terms of severity between children with positive bacterial PCR and those with negative results: PICU admission (100% vs. 50%, P-value = 0.015); respiratory support necessity (100% vs. 18.6%, P-value \u003C 0.001); Wood-Downes score (mean = 8.7 vs. 4.8 points, P-value \u003C 0.001); GENVIP scale (mean = 17 vs. 10.1, P-value \u003C 0.001); and length of hospitalization (mean = 12.1 vs. 7.5 days, P-value = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Bacteremia is not frequent in infants hospitalized with RSV respiratory infection, however, it should be considered in the most severe cases.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cebey-L\u00F3pez, Miriam; Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; G\u00F3mez-Carballa, Alberto; Martin\u00F3n-Torres, Nazareth; Martin\u00F3n-S\u00E1nchez, Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa; Justicia-Grande, Antonio; Rivero-Calle, Irene; Pinnock, Elli; Salas, Antonio; Fink, Colin; Martin\u00F3n-Torres, Federico","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08b862f9103eb1590d60bd0312f750729b3f2c7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["RSV","PCR","PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","P-value","RSV-positive","RSV respiratory infection","positive RSV respiratory illness","RSV infection","positive bacterial PCR","bacterial presence","risk of bacteremia","mean","patients","confirmed RSV acute respiratory illness","rate of occult bacteremia","Streptococcus pneumoniae","predictive factors of bacteremia","Klebsiella pneumoniae","infants","ARI","respiratory support necessity","previous suspicion of bacterial superinfection","Streptococcus pyogenes","Haemophilus influenzae","negative results","actual rate","acute bronchiolitis","conventional cultures","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Escherichia coli","Staphylococcus aureus","Meningococcus","terms of severity","prospective multicenter study","blood","GENDRES-network","addition","empirical antibiotic treatment","significant differences","Wood-Downes score","METHODS","molecular techniques","PICU admission","GENVIP scale","points","days","length of hospitalization","aim","BACKGROUND","age","severe cases","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Ebola glycoprotein (GP) is involved in this process through activating dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. However, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we showed that LSECtin (also known as CLEC4G) plays an important role in GP-mediated inflammatory responses in human DCs. Anti-LSECtin mAb engagement induced TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 production in DCs, whereas silencing of LSECtin abrogated this effect. Intriguingly, as a pathogen-derived ligand, Ebola GP could trigger TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 release by DCs through LSECtin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that LSECtin initiated signaling via association with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and induced Syk activation. Mutation of key tyrosines in the DAP12 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif abrogated LSECtin-mediated signaling. Furthermore, Syk inhibitors significantly reduced the GP-triggered cytokine production in DCs.

Understanding the pattern and the drivers of BTV-1 spread in Andalusia is critical for effective detection and control of future epidemics. A long-standing metric for quantifying the behaviour of infectious diseases is the case-reproduction ratio (R(t)), defined as the average number of secondary cases arising from a single infected case at time t (for t\u003E0). Here we apply a method using epidemic trees to estimate the between-herd case reproduction ratio directly from epidemic data allowing the spatial and temporal variability in transmission to be described. We then relate this variability to predictors describing the hosts, vectors and the environment to better understand why the epidemic spread more quickly in some regions or periods. The R(t) value for the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia peaked in July at 4.6, at the start of the epidemic, then decreased to 2.2 by August, dropped below 1 by September (0.8), and by October it had decreased to 0.02. BTV spread was the consequence of both local transmission within established disease foci and BTV expansion to distant new areas (i.e. new foci), which resulted in a high variability in BTV transmission, not only among different areas, but particularly through time, which suggests that general control measures applied at broad spatial scales are unlikely to be effective. This high variability through time was probably due to the impact of temperature on BTV transmission, as evidenced by a reduction in the value of R(t) by 0.0041 for every unit increase (day) in the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which is itself directly dependent on temperature. Moreover, within the range of values at which BTV-1 transmission occurred in Andalusia (20.6\u00B0C to 29.5\u00B0C) there was a positive correlation between temperature and R(t) values, although the relationship was not linear, probably as a result of the complex relationship between temperature and the different parameters affecting BTV transmission. R(t) values for BTV-1 in Andalusia fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21\u00B0C, a much higher threshold than that reported in other BTV outbreaks, such as the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe. This divergence may be explained by differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) compared those of the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus). Importantly, we found that BTV transmission (R(t) value) increased significantly in areas with higher densities of sheep. Our analysis also established that control of BTV-1 in Andalusia was complicated by the simultaneous establishment of several distant foci at the start of the epidemic, which may have been caused by several independent introductions of infected vectors from the North of Africa. We discuss the implications of these findings for BTV surveillance and control in this region of Europe.","publish_time":"2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Napp, S.; Allepuz, A.; Purse, B.

In humans and mice, members of the type II transmembrane protease family (TTSP), e.g., TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11d (HAT), have been shown to cleave influenza virus HA for viral activation and infectivity in vitro. Recently, we reported that inactivation of a single HA-activating protease gene, Tmprss2, in knockout mice inhibits the spread of H1N1 influenza viruses. However, after infection of Tmprss2 knockout mice with an H3N2 influenza virus, only a slight increase in survival was observed, and mice still lost body weight. In this study, we investigated an additional trypsin-like protease, TMPRSS4. Both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are expressed in the same cell types of the mouse lung. Deletion of Tmprss4 alone in knockout mice does not protect them from body weight loss and death upon infection with H3N2 influenza virus. In contrast, Tmprss2(\u2212/\u2212) Tmprss4(\u2212/\u2212) double-knockout mice showed a remarkably reduced virus spread and lung pathology, in addition to reduced body weight loss and mortality. Thus, our results identified TMPRSS4 as a second host cell protease that, in addition to TMPRSS2, is able to activate the HA of H3N2 influenza virus in vivo. IMPORTANCE Influenza epidemics and recurring pandemics are responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality. Due to high variability of the virus genome, resistance to available antiviral drugs is frequently observed, and new targets for treatment of influenza are needed. Host cell factors essential for processing of the virus hemagglutinin represent very suitable drug targets because the virus is dependent on these host factors for replication. We reported previously that Tmprss2-deficient mice are protected against H1N1 virus infections, but only marginal protection against H3N2 virus infections was observed. Here we show that deletion of two host protease genes, Tmprss2 and Tmprss4, strongly reduced viral spread as well as lung pathology and resulted in increased survival after H3N2 virus infection. Thus, TMPRSS4 represents another host cell factor that is involved in cleavage activation of H3N2 influenza viruses in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"K\u00FChn, Nora; Bergmann, Silke; K\u00F6sterke, Nadine; Lambertz, Ruth L.

Both MS2 and Phi6 partitioned more to the surface of concrete and polypropylene than to the surface of porcelain or PVC. Partitioning of viruses in wastewater among the liquid, biosolids, and material surface does not appear to mitigate the potential for aerosolization of virus, as most of the virus remains in the liquid phase.","publish_time":"2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Titcombe Lee, Mari; Pruden, Amy; Marr, Linsey C.","journal":"Environ Sci Technol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fed59469020955a3f7dfe77ab7c593643d48f505.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c723a1d259891519fd489b94a7ff128f9a5555aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4869619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surface of porcelain","surface of concrete","liquid fraction","liquid phase","partitioning of MS2","digested sludge","synthetic sludge","wastewater systems","material surfaces of porcelain","real sludge","aerosolization of viruses","PVC","potential","polypropylene","virions","wastewater treatment plant","Phi6 bacteriophages","polyvinyl chloride","biosolids","insight","text","Image","cases"],"language":"en"},

Pre-infection with PRRSV leads to exacerbated disease caused by S. suis infection. Very few studies have assessed the immunological mechanisms underlying this higher susceptibility. Since antigen presenting cells play a major role in the initiation of the immune response, the in vitro transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and monocytes in the context of PRRSV and S. suis co-infection was investigated. BMDCs were found to be more permissive than monocytes to PRRSV infection; S. suis phagocytosis by PRRSV-infected BMDCs was found to be impaired, whereas no effect was found on bacterial intracellular survival. Transcription profile analysis, with a major focus on inflammatory genes, following S. suis infection, with and without pre-infection with PRRSV, was then performed. While PRRSV pre-infection had little effect on monocytes response to S. suis infection, a significant expression of several pro-inflammatory molecules was observed in BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV after a subsequent infection with S. suis. While an additive effect could be observed for CCL4, CCL14, CCL20, and IL-15, a distinct synergistic up-regulatory effect was observed for IL-6, CCL5 and TNF-\u03B1 after co-infection. This increased pro-inflammatory response by DCs could participate in the exacerbation of the disease observed during PRRSV and S. suis co-infection.","publish_time":"2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Auray, Ga\u00EBl; Lachance, Claude; Wang, Yingchao; Gagnon, Carl A.; Segura, Mariela; Gottschalk, Marcelo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/698174035746c185ce55489b4a345026d82dcc42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4877111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","suis infection","PRRSV pre-infection","suis co-infection","subsequent infection","PRRSV-infected BMDCs","context of PRRSV","suis phagocytosis","Streptococcus suis","monocytes response","BMDCs pre-infected","immune response","increased pro-inflammatory response","little effect","regulatory effect","additive effect","pro-inflammatory molecules","inflammatory genes","bacterial pathogens","transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells","major role","major focus","exacerbated disease","bacterial intracellular survival","important swine pathogens","significant expression","respiratory syndrome virus","TNF-\u03B1","immunological mechanisms","CCL4","entry door","CCL5","initiation","Transcription profile analysis","higher susceptibility","CCL14","CCL20","antigen","exacerbation","studies"],"language":"en"},

The mortality rate of infected people could be up to 70% with fatal encephalitis and encephalomyelitis. Up to now, there are no effective treatments for BV infection. Among the various proteins encoded by monkey B virus, gD, a conserved structural protein, harbors important application value for serological diagnosis of frequent variations of the monkey B virus. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to expressed the gD protein of BV in Escherichia coli by a recombinant vector, and prepare specific monoclonal antibodies against gD of BV to pave the way for effective and quick diagnosis reagent research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gD gene of BV was optimized by OptimWiz to improve codon usage bias and synthesis, and the recombinant plasmid, pET32a/gD, was constructed and expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3). The expressed fusion protein, His-gD, was purified and the BALB/c mice were immunized by this protein. Spleen cells from the immunized mice and SP2/0 myeloma cells were fused together, and the monoclonal cell strains were obtained by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening, followed by preparation of monoclonal antibody ascetic fluid. RESULTS: The optimized gD protein was highly expressed in E. coli and successfully purified. Five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against BV were obtained and named as 4E3, 3F8, 3E7, 1H3 and 4B6, and with ascetic fluid titers of 2 \u00D7 10(6), 2 \u00D7 10(5), 2 \u00D7 10(5), 2 \u00D7 10(3) and 2 \u00D7 10(2), respectively. The 1H3 and 4E3 belonged to the IgG2b subclass, while 3E7, 3F8 and 4B6 belonged to the IgG1 subclass. CONCLUSIONS: The cell lines obtained in this work secreted potent, stable and specific anti-BV mAbs, which were suitable for the development of herpes B virus diagnosis reagents.","publish_time":"2016-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Zian; Sun, Tao; Xia, Xueshan; Wei, Qiujiang; Song, Yuzhu; Han, Qinqin; Chen, Qiang; Hu, Juan; Zhang, Jinyang","journal":"Jundishapur J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1e8903986998f998a4ee66cbbf1c0b05ebf2eb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4877525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli Rosetta"],"organizations":[],"locations":["BV"],"keyphrases":["gD of BV","gD protein of BV","gD gene of BV","optimized gD protein","BV infection","monkey B virus","expressed fusion protein","specific anti-BV mAbs","development of herpes B virus diagnosis reagents","specific monoclonal antibodies","enveloped DNA virus","conserved structural protein","monoclonal cell strains","4B6","3F8","preparation of monoclonal antibody ascetic fluid","3E7","Escherichia coli","immunized mice","1H3","4E3","coli Rosetta","ascetic fluid titers","serological diagnosis of frequent variations","recombinant vector","quick diagnosis reagent research","recombinant plasmid","cell lines","c mice","effective treatments","myeloma cells","IgG2b subclass","Spleen cells","IgG1 subclass","important application value","work secreted potent","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","ELISA","screening","way","synthesis","cercopithecidae","double","OptimWiz","SP2","codon usage bias","zoonotic disease","METHODS","various proteins","BACKGROUND","natural host","mortality rate of infected people","MATERIALS","BALB","pET32a","study","RESULTS","fatal encephalitis","encephalomyelitis","CONCLUSIONS","DE3","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Notably, the development of replicating-competent reporter-expressing viruses (RCREVs) has provided an excellent option to detect directly viral replication without the use of secondary labeling, which represents a significant advance in virology. This article reviews the applications of RCREVs in diagnostic and molecular virology, including rapid neutralization tests, high-throughput screening systems, identification of viral receptors and virus-host interactions, dynamics of viral infections in vitro and in vivo, vaccination approaches and others. However, there remain various challenges associated with RCREVs, including pathogenicity alterations due to the insertion of a reporter gene, instability or loss of the reporter gene expression, or attenuation of reporter signals in vivo. Despite all these limitations, RCREVs have become powerful tools for both basic and applied virology with the development of new technologies for generating RCREVs, the inventions of novel reporters and the better understanding of regulation of viral replication.","publish_time":"2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yongfeng; Li, Lian-Feng; Yu, Shaoxiong; Wang, Xiao; Zhang, Lingkai; Yu, Jiahui; Xie, Libao; Li, Weike; Ali, Razim; Qiu, Hua-Ji","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/790c6002db87c03cd6bdab85964c52808d09a218.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4885082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","rapid detection of viral replication","applications of RCREVs","identification of viral receptors","dynamics of viral infections","competent reporter","reporter gene expression","molecular virology","applied virology","attenuation of reporter signals","high-throughput screening systems","rapid neutralization tests","virus transport","used tests","development of replicating","virus-host interactions","development of new technologies","wild-type viruses","better understanding of regulation","instability","loss","powerful tools","inventions of novel reporters","insertion","diagnostic","demands","use of secondary labeling","real time","excellent option","significant advance","pathogenicity alterations","immunostaining","limitations","antivirals","vaccination approaches","various challenges","article"],"language":"en"},

Despite a huge number of clinical trials, any success to find a chemotherapeutic agent that can effectively destroy melanoma is yet to be achieved. Para-phenylenediamine (p-PD) in the hair dyes is reported to purely serve as an external dyeing agent. Very little is known about whether p-PD has any effect on the melanin producing cells. We have demonstrated p-PD mediated apoptotic death of both human and mouse melanoma cells in vitro. Mouse melanoma tumour growth was also arrested by the apoptotic activity of intraperitoneal administration of p-PD with almost no side effects. This apoptosis is shown to occur primarily via loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caspase 8 activation. p-PD mediated apoptosis was also confirmed by the increase in sub-G0/G1 cell number. Thus, our experimental observation suggests that p-PD can be a potential less expensive candidate to be developed as a chemotherapeutic agent for melanoma.","publish_time":"2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhowmick, Debajit; Bhar, Kaushik; Mallick, Sanjaya K.; Das, Subhadip; Chatterjee, Nabanita; Sarkar, Tuhin Subhra; Chakrabarti, Rajarshi; Das Saha, Krishna; Siddhanta, Anirban","journal":"Biochem Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/740bbfc884c50507fbf78e9424da319a49c48af0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4886052.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p-PD mediated apoptosis","mouse melanoma cells","chemotherapeutic agent","Mouse melanoma tumour growth","apoptotic activity of intraperitoneal administration of p","external dyeing agent","apoptotic death","G1 cell number","loss of mitochondrial membrane potential","huge number of clinical trials","MMP","ROS","generation of reactive oxygen species","increase","sub-G0","success","aggressive forms of cancer","standard chemotherapeutics","caspase","expensive candidate","melanin","Para-phenylenediamine","experimental observation","hair dyes","activation","effects"],"language":"en"},

We collected fruit bodies belonging to ectomycorrhizal\u2014basidiomycete families and genera, sampled the woody vegetation, and described soils and landforms at 11 permanent sampling stations. We first calculated similarity matrices among stations, one for each descriptor (fungal species abundance, woody species abundance, and abiotic variables). We then explored the dependence among these matrices using Mantel and partial Mantel tests, path analysis, and comparisons of ordinations and classifications. Similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungus communities was strongly and significantly correlated with tree community similarity, even when controlling for the effect of environmental similarity. When the tests were made with a similarity matrix based on those tree species that are known to be hosts of ectomycorrhizal fungi, abiotic similarity explained a significant portion of the residual variation in the similarity among fungus communities. To explore this complex relationship further, we analyzed species associations. The preference of fungus associations for different sets of abiotic conditions showed that some factors affecting fungal species distribution were different from those affecting the distribution of their tree hosts. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed that humus characteristics seemed to be important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The continuum concept was useful to interpret the complex relations among symbiotic species. Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae\u2014forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Our results and those of previous mycosynecological studies agree with these predictions. The results have implications for the conservation of biodiversity: site selection for conservation based on vegetation classification or mapping, or on distribution of tree species, may miss important fungal species.","publish_time":"1992-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Natel, Patrick; Neumann, Peter","journal":"Ecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e1a3619b97147ff00946a56bfaca1719ce7ff96.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mantel"],"keyphrases":["distribution of tree species","fungal species distribution","species associations","particular tree species","symbiotic species","tree communities","fungal species abundance","important fungal species","woody species richness","woody species abundance","tree community similarity","abiotic similarity","fungal communities","ectomycorrhizal fungus communities","tree hosts","ratio of fungus species richness","host tree","similarity matrix","basidiomycete communities","calculated similarity matrices","fungal symbionts","abiotic gradients","effect of environmental similarity","important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi","woody vegetation","realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes","abiotic variables","type of distribution","beta diversity of fungi","preference of fungus associations","different sets of abiotic conditions","factors","results","Trees","community gradients","partial Mantel tests","beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae","conservation of biodiversity","basidiomycete families","vegetation classification","complex relationship","permanent sampling stations","humus characteristics","path analysis","site selection","significant portion","residual variation","series of forest ecosystems","indirect gradient analyses","landforms","soils","genera","mapping","descriptor","comparisons of ordinations","main component","local scale","southern Quebec","previous mycosynecological studies","strength","fruit bodies","predictions","implications","continuum concept","classifications","dependence"],"language":"en"},

Cloud computing is distributed computing over a network, using a program or application that can run on many connected computers and in different locations around the globe simultaneously at a reduced cost. This distributed cloud computing presents law enforcement authorities with the unique challenge of policing Internet crime. Cloud computing relies on sharing resources to achieve coherence, and in doing so creates economies of scale for converged infrastructures and shared services. Accordingly, one problem facing the authorities is the presence of trans- and multijurisdictional crimes. In this chapter, I explore this topic in the contexts of Hong Kong and Singapore, as both are key players on the international stage, especially in relation to international finance and information technology. In both locations, infrastructure works to maintain global financial center status. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. A brief overview of the development of cloud computing is followed by an examination of cybercrime risks in the cloud. Then, I review how the authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore respond to cybercrime risks and explore the current government policies on cloud computing, particularly in fighting cybercrime.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laurie Lau, Yiu Chung","journal":"The Cloud Security Ecosystem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f299aafd1e2b807e8065dc83015ee4c4d8b54138.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161379.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gartner Consulting Group"],"locations":["Asia","Hong Kong","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["distributed cloud computing","development of cloud computing","concept of cloud computing","distributed computing","mobile Internetwork","Internetwork technology","smart phone sales","smart mobile phone web","global mobile phone total","Internetwork landscape","regular phone sales","Singapore","examination of cybercrime risks","smart phones","information technology","fighting cybercrime","negative effects","popularity","chapter","law enforcement authorities","contexts of Hong Kong","international stage","international finance","different locations","unique challenge of policing Internet crime","global financial center status","routers","interconnection of computer networks","special gateways","relation","current government policies","converged infrastructures","Gartner Consulting Group","time","presence of trans-","economies of scale","shared services","globe","Asia","society","key players","topic","surge","increase","sharing resources","packets of electronic data","connected computers","brief overview","multijurisdictional crimes","application","report","things","life","reduced cost","program","coherence","problem","commercialization","exception","remainder"],"language":"en"}]}

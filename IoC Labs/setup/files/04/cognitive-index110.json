However, it has the potential to cause severe infection in young children and immunocompromised adults. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses. However, the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonise the intracellular antiviral defences has not yet been investigated. The potential role of the HCoV-OC43 structural (M and N) and accessory proteins (ns2a and ns5a) in the alteration of antiviral gene expression was investigated in this study. HCoV-OC43M, N, ns2a and ns5a proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells before challenge with Sendai virus. The Human Antiviral Response PCR array was used to profile the antiviral gene expression in HEK-293 cells. Over 30 genes were downregulated in the presence of one of the HCoV-OC43 proteins, e.g. genes representing mitogen-activated protein kinases, toll-like receptors, interferons, interleukins, and signaling transduction proteins. Our findings suggest that similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 has the ability to downregulate the transcription of genes critical for the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins in antagonising antiviral gene expression.","publish_time":"2018-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beidas, Meshal; Chehadeh, Wassim","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b99756e9eb7fccb34ed2f64a602e72b7c7797a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086905.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29619598/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3832-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43 proteins","HCoV-OC43 structural","role of HCoV","ability of HCoV","accessory proteins","ns5a proteins","HCoV-OC43M","Human coronavirus OC43","express proteins","transduction proteins","antagonising antiviral gene expression","alteration of antiviral gene expression","MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV","activation of different antiviral","intracellular antiviral defences","potential role","Human Antiviral Response PCR array","ns2a","HEK","cells","transcription of genes critical","human embryonic kidney","respiratory virus","Sendai virus","toll","mitogen-activated protein kinases","young children","severe infection","receptors","immunocompromised adults","early innate immune responses","interferons","interleukins","challenge","pathways","study","presence","findings","studies"],"language":"en"},

FCoVs are divided into two serotypes with markedly different infection rates among cat populations around the world. A baculovirus-expressed type-specific domain of the spike proteins of FCoV was used to survey the infection of the two viruses over the past eight years in Taiwan. RESULTS: An immunofluorescence assay based on cells infected with the recombinant viruses that was capable of distinguishing between the two types of viral infection was established. A total of 833 cases from a teaching hospital was surveyed for prevalence of different FCoV infections. Infection of the type I FCoV was dominant, with a seropositive rate of 70.4%, whereas 3.5% of cats were infected with the type II FCoV. In most cases, results derived from serotyping and genotyping were highly agreeable. However, 16.7% (4/24) FIP cats and 9.8% (6/61) clinically healthy cats were found to possess antibodies against both viruses. Moreover, most of the cats (84.6%, 22/26) infected with a genotypic untypable virus bearing a type I FCoV antibody. CONCLUSION: A relatively simple serotyping method to distinguish between two types of FCoV infection was developed. Based on this method, two types of FCoV infection in Taiwan was first carried out. Type I FCoV was found to be predominant compared with type II virus. Results derived from serotyping and genotyping support our current understanding of evolution of disease-related FCoV and transmission of FIP.","publish_time":"2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ying-Ting; Chueh, Ling-Ling; Wan, Cho-Hua","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94c6aacd8aeb83b9798d43627bcf867944fb8afd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4236817.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25123112/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0186-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["types of FCoV infection","FCoV antibody","disease-related FCoV","spike proteins of FCoV","prevalence of different FCoV infections","FIP cats","types of viral infection","different infection rates","RESULTS","type-specific domain","healthy cats","simple serotyping method","transmission of FIP","recombinant viruses","cases","Taiwan","fatal disease","genotyping support","feline coronavirus","Feline infectious peritonitis","genotypic untypable virus","current understanding of evolution","cat populations","capable of distinguishing","teaching hospital","cells","BACKGROUND","serotypes","world","immunofluorescence assay","baculovirus","years","CONCLUSION","antibodies","seropositive rate","total","FCoVs"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to identify issues that determine the adherence of professionals to precautions for preventing transmission of microorganisms in primary health care. METHOD: This was a qualitative study, using focus groups of primary health care staff, in two Brazilian municipalities. The data were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: Four focus groups were conducted with 20 professionals (11 community health workers, 5 nursing assistants and 4 nurses), and the analysed content was organized into four thematic categories. These categories are: low risk perception, weaknesses in knowledge, insufficient in-service training and infrastructure limitations. Participants expressed their weaknesses in knowledge of standard and transmission based precautions, mainly for hand hygiene and tuberculosis. A lack of appropriate resources and standardization in sharps disposal management was also highlighted by the participants. CONCLUSION: The study points out the need to provide in-service training for professionals on the transmission of microorganisms in primary health care to ensure adequate level of risk perception and knowledge.

Limited data exist supporting the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) during this clinical setting. The aim of this study is to assess the role of FOB during NIPPV in patients with decompensated COPD acute exacerbation. Methods This study is a randomized prospective case control pilot study carried out on 50 patients - admitted to critical care units at Alexandria University Hospital, Egypt - suffering from hypercapnic ARF secondary to COPD exacerbation with Kelly Matthay Score from 2 to 4. All patients received NIPPV. Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups: group I (cases) (25 patients) was subjected to additional intervention of early FOB during the first 6\u201312h from admission while group II (control) (25 patients) received the conventional treatment and NIPPV only. Outcome parameters measured were changes in ABG data, duration of NIPPV, rate of its success, ICU stay and mortality as well as the safety of FOB and possible complications. Results No significant difference was detected between the 2 groups regarding the baseline characteristics. No serious complications happened from FOB, and Oxygen desaturation happened in 4/25 patients (16%), Tachycardia in 2/25 patients (8%). In group I, 23 patients (92%) were successfully weaned from NIPPV versus 16 patients (64%) in group II (p =0.037). Total duration of NIPPV was 28.52h in group I versus 56.25h in group II (p =0.001). Length of ICU stay was 4.84days in group I versus 8.68days in group II (p =0.001). Only 1 patient died in group I versus 3 patients in group II (p =0.609). Conclusion The early application of FOB during NIPPV in patients with ARF due to COPD exacerbation was shown to be safe. Significant improvement in the outcome of patients who underwent FOB was noticed in terms of improved ABG data, shorter duration of NIPPV, higher percentage of success and shorter ICU stay while no significant difference was detected in mortality.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rady, W.; Abouelela, A.; Abdallah, A.; Youssef, W.","journal":"Egyptian Journal of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37c1a59adb315f5cca2c00241ca72730c38f25c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132652.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288127/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0422763814001484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcdt.2014.06.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0422763814001484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FOB","Alexandria University Hospital","ARF","Kelly Matthay Score","NIPPV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcome of patients","selected patients","shorter duration of NIPPV","Total duration of NIPPV","COPD exacerbation","safety of FOB","role of FOB","early application of FOB","decompensated COPD acute exacerbation","additional intervention of early FOB","shorter ICU","significant difference","hypercapnic ARF secondary","Length of ICU stay","days","Limited data","Significant improvement","mortality","terms of improved ABG data","hypercapnic acute respiratory failure","randomized prospective case control pilot study","line treatment","conventional treatment","equal groups","possible complications","Outcome parameters","serious complications","higher percentage of success","Egypt - suffering","Alexandria University Hospital","critical care units","invasive positive pressure ventilation","Abstract Introduction","Kelly Matthay Score","rate","use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy","cases","Oxygen desaturation","Methods","Conclusion","admission","clinical setting","baseline characteristics","Tachycardia","aim"],"language":"en"},

Effective treatments are needed to minimize death, maximize welfare, and maintain growth and productivity. The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy of a commercially available nutritional supplement (Diaque, Boehringer-Ingelheim Vetmedica Inc., St. Joseph, MO) and i.v. lactated Ringer\u0027s solution (LRS) in rehydrating, preventing acidemia, and correcting electrolyte imbalances in an experimental model for calf scours. Twenty-four colostrum-fed suckling dairy calves were used in a modified crossover design. An osmotic diarrhea was induced by orally feeding commercial milk replacer modified with high level of sucrose to create a hypertonic milk solution, and administering oral hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone for 48 h. The intention was to create a challenge sufficient to result in moderately dehydrated, standing calves without producing severe depression or loss of suckle. The efficacy of i.v. fluid therapy and a commercial nutritional supplement were subsequently compared for reversing the effects of the diarrheal disease. Treatment A consisted of administering the nutritional supplement according to label directions (100 g in 1.9 L of warm water, 3 times a day), and treatment B consisted of i.v. LRS (2 L, once a day). Clinical signs and laboratory results were obtained once daily by a blinded observer.

FT data mining is more suitable for extracting interesting information from real-world data that may be polluted by noise. In particular, the increasing amount of today\u2019s biological databases requires such a data mining technique to mine important data, e.g., motifs. In this paper, we propose the concept of proportional FT mining of frequent patterns. The number of tolerable faults in a proportional FT pattern is proportional to the length of the pattern. Two algorithms are designed for solving this problem. The first algorithm, named FT-BottomUp, applies an FT-Apriori heuristic and finds all FT patterns with any number of faults. The second algorithm, FT-LevelWise, divides all FT patterns into several groups according to the number of tolerable faults, and mines the content patterns of each group in turn. By applying our algorithm on real data, two reported epitopes of spike proteins of SARS-CoV can be found in our resulting itemset and the proportional FT data mining is better than the fixed FT data mining for this application.","publish_time":"2009-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Guanling; Peng, Sheng-Lung; Lin, Yuh-Tzu","journal":"Inf Syst Front","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50421f4a4d4bc6bf6e923f2bfc806bde6529f34f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087812.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-009-9158-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FT patterns","proportional FT data mining","fixed FT data mining","proportional FT pattern","FT-BottomUp","FT-LevelWise","data mining technique","concept of proportional FT mining of frequent patterns","pattern mining","FT-Apriori heuristic","important data","real-world data","real data","content patterns","number of faults","number of tolerable faults","today\u2019s biological databases","reported epitopes of spike proteins of SARS","resulting itemset","interesting information","fault-tolerant","CoV","groups","length","application","reports","turn","years","motifs","algorithms","problem","paper","noise"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess seasonality of HPIV types 1\u20104, clinical outcomes by HPIV type, and risk factors for illness severity. PATIENTS/METHODS: This retrospective study was performed from January 2013 to December 2015 in children and adults with HPIV, detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, participating in a community surveillance study of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in New York City and patients admitted to a tertiary care center in the same neighborhood. Seasonality trends by HPIV type were compared between the community and hospital groups. The associations between HPIV type, demographics, clinical characteristics, and illness severity were assessed. RESULTS: HPIV was detected in 69 (4%) of 1753 community surveillance participants (median age 9.2 years) and 680 hospitalized patients (median age 6.8 years). Seasonality for HPIV types 1\u20103 agreed with previously described patterns; HPIV\u20104 occurred annually in late summer and fall. In the community cohort, 22 (32%) participants sought medical care, 9 (13%) reported antibiotic use, and 20 (29%) reported \u22651 day of missed work or school.

The objective of this paper is to critically review the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience regarding COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hebei and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and non-essential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of Fangcang shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. While some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well-controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers and contacts, and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organized, proactive and unified strategy at a national level. Delays result in significantly higher death tolls.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Fujun; Tu, Lei; Yang, Yongshi; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Hu, Qinyong; Cao, Feng; Jiang, Taijiao; Sun, Jinlyu; Xu, Guogang; Chang, Christopher","journal":"Can J Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/877f7dfd596cabc12cf7228ffb19cd6b663cea93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162773.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X20303950?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X20303950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439306/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fangcang"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["aggressive quarantine measures","early implementation of quarantine measures","enforcement of drastic quarantine measures","management of COVID","included antivirals","new hospitals","early recognition of infected individuals","rapid sequencing","near disappearance of new cases","rapid construction","complete isolation of Wuhan","tracking of infected persons","establishment of Fangcang shelter hospitals","effectiveness","interferons","corticosteroids","mechanical ventilation","high flow oxygen","China","carriers","intravenous immunoglobulin","tocilizumab","hydroxychloroquine","pandemic","unclear pending well-controlled clinical trials","contacts","unified strategy","later Hebei","testing kits","virus","convalescent plasma infusions","worst infectious disease outbreaks","lessons","schools","closure","history","weak descriptive data","Chinese experience","prevention","non-essential businesses","national level","SARS-CoV","Delays","higher death tolls","country","rest","vaccine","addition","available evidence","critical factors","likely resources","paper","absence","moderate success","deaths","objective","steps"],"language":"en"},

To identify the regions of the viral genome involved in this process, we used SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to identify RNA aptamers which bind specifically to Core in vitro. Comparison of these aptamers to multiple HCV genomes revealed the presence of a conserved terminal loop motif within short RNA stem-loop structures. We postulated that interactions of these motifs, as well as sub-motifs which were present in HCV genomes at statistically significant levels, with the Core protein may drive virion assembly. We mutated 8 of these predicted motifs within the HCV infectious molecular clone JFH-1, thereby producing a range of mutant viruses predicted to possess altered RNA secondary structures. RNA replication and viral titre were unaltered in viruses possessing only one mutated structure. However, infectivity titres were decreased in viruses possessing a higher number of mutated regions. This work thus identified multiple novel RNA motifs which appear to contribute to genome packaging. We suggest that these structures act as cooperative packaging signals to drive specific RNA encapsidation during HCV assembly.","publish_time":"2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stewart, H.; Bingham, R.J.; White, S.

Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether influenza type A virus infection enhances inhalation sensitization and increases airway responsiveness in mice. Methods: Mice were infected by intranasal inoculation with influenza A viruses (strains: H1 N1 and H3 N2 ) or PBS. Animals were exposed to aerosols of ovalbumin on day 3. Two weeks after ovalbumin sensitization, mice were challenged with ovalbumin aerosols; 24 hours later, airway responsiveness (AR) to inhaled methacholine, levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Results: Neither influenza A virus (H1 N1 nor H3 N2 ) alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone caused changes in AR or IgE. However, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with either influenza A virus increased AR and levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE. On BALF-cell analysis, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A increased the number of lymphocytes but not the number of eosinophils. No difference in AR or IgE levels was observed between the 2 strains of influenza A viruses. Immmunostaining of BALF cells showed an increase in T cells, especially CD8\u002B cells, with ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A. Conclusion: Infection by influenza A virus enhances sensitization to inhaled antigens and airway responsiveness in mice by means of mechanisms including CD8\u002B cells and antigen-specific IgE.

This partnership focuses on pandemic preparedness planning, establishing and enhancing influenza surveillance systems, improving laboratory capacity for detection of influenza viruses, estimating the influenza disease burden, and providing evidence to support policies for the introduction and increased use of seasonal influenza vaccines. METHODS: Various published and unpublished data from public and WHO sources, programme indicators of the CDC cooperative agreement and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework were reviewed and analysed. Analyses and review of the programme indicators and published articles enabled us to generate information that was unavailable from only WHO sources. RESULTS: Most (19/22) countries of the Region have established influenza surveillance system; 16 countries in the Region have designated National Influenza Centres. The Region has seen considerable improvement in geographic coverage of influenza surveillance and influenza detection. Virus sharing has improved and almost all of the participating laboratories have achieved a 100% efficiency score in the WHO external quality assessment programme. At least seven countries have estimated their influenza disease burden using surveillance data and at least 17 are now using seasonal influenza vaccines as a control strategy for influenza illness. CONCLUSION: The Region has achieved substantial progress in surveillance and response to seasonal influenza, despite the adverse effects to the health systems of many countries due to acute and protracted emergencies and other significant challenges.","publish_time":"2019-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malik, Mamunur R.; Abubakar, Abdinasir; Kholy, Amgad E.; Buliva, Evans; Khan, Wasiq M.; Lamichhane, Jaya; Moen, Ann; McCarron, Margaret; Zureick, Kinda; Obtel, Majdouline","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36b32304b78cb6303c64dd29146a766e984bdf3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102713.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.07.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119302539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522968/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119302539","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","CDC","Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework","National Influenza Centres"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza detection","influenza illness","influenza surveillance systems","influenza disease burden","detection of influenza viruses","National Influenza Centres","geographic coverage of influenza surveillance","Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework","increased use of seasonal influenza vaccines","countries","surveillance data","Disease Control","programme indicators","pandemic preparedness planning","health systems","response","sources","control strategy","unpublished data","external quality assessment programme","published articles","CDC cooperative agreement","World Health Organization Regional Office","Eastern Mediterranean","laboratory capacity","introduction","Prevention","United States Centers","considerable improvement","protracted emergencies","evidence","substantial progress","adverse effects","efficiency score","policies","BACKGROUND","METHODS","review","significant challenges","information","Analyses","partnership","CONCLUSION","participating laboratories","Virus sharing","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Influenza virus hemagglutinins bind Sias during the infection of their normal hosts, while the encoded neuraminidases and/or esterases remove or modify the Sia to allow virion release or to prevent rebinding. Sias naturally occur in a variety of modified forms, and modified Sias can alter influenza virus host tropisms through their altered interactions with the viral glycoproteins. However, the distribution of modified Sia forms and their effects on pathogen-host interactions are still poorly understood. Here we used probes developed from viral Sia-binding proteins to detect O-acetylated (4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl) Sias displayed on the tissues of some natural or experimental hosts for influenza viruses. These modified Sias showed highly variable displays between the hosts and tissues examined. The 9-O-acetyl (and 7,9-) modified Sia forms were found on cells and tissues of many hosts, including mice, humans, ferrets, guinea pigs, pigs, horses, dogs, as well as in those of ducks and embryonated chicken egg tissues and membranes, although in variable amounts. The 4-O-acetyl Sias were found in the respiratory tissues of fewer animals, being primarily displayed in the horse and guinea pig, but were not detected in humans or pigs. The results suggest that these Sia variants may influence virus tropisms by altering and selecting their cell interactions. IMPORTANCE Sialic acids (Sias) are key glycans that control or modulate many normal cell and tissue functions while also interacting with a variety of pathogens, including many different viruses. Sias are naturally displayed in a variety of different forms, with modifications at several positions that can alter their functional interactions with pathogens. In addition, Sias are often modified or removed by enzymes such as host or pathogen esterases or sialidases (neuraminidases), and Sia modifications can alter those enzymatic activities to impact pathogen infections. Sia chemical diversity in different hosts and tissues likely alters the pathogen-host interactions and influences the outcome of infection. Here we explored the display of 4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia forms in some target tissues for influenza virus infection in mice, humans, birds, guinea pigs, ferrets, swine, horses, and dogs, which encompass many natural and laboratory hosts of those viruses.","publish_time":"2017-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wasik, Brian R.; Barnard, Karen N.; Ossiboff, Robert J.; Khedri, Zahra; Feng, Kurtis H.; Yu, Hai; Chen, Xi; Perez, Daniel R.; Varki, Ajit; Parrish, Colin R.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca678602a715c23201b3947824b05053b0f56c4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5588038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904995/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00379-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sia"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetyl Sias","modified Sias","distribution of modified Sia forms","Sia modifications","different hosts","variety of modified forms","target tissues","Sia variants","influenza viruses","pathogen-host interactions","influenza virus infection","normal hosts","variety of different forms","different viruses","influenza virus host tropisms","guinea pigs","experimental hosts","laboratory hosts","cell interactions","Influenza virus hemagglutinins","Sia chemical diversity","viral Sia-binding proteins","virus tropisms","respiratory tissues of fewer animals","pathogen esterases","humans","different animals","altered interactions","variety of pathogens","functional interactions","embryonated chicken egg tissues","mice","ferrets","impact pathogen infections","cells","outcome of infection","horses","normal cell","dogs","IMPORTANCE Sialic acids","important glycans","encoded neuraminidases","key glycans","variable displays","viral glycoproteins","variable amounts","membranes","enzymatic activities","birds","effects","frequent targets","swine","sialidases","ducks","positions","tissue functions","virion release","probes","enzymes","rebinding","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

PCV2 replication could be promoted by low doses of ochratoxin A (OTA) as in our previous study and selenium has been shown to attenuate PCV2 replication. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of selenomethionine (SeMet), the major component of organic selenium, on OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion and its potential mechanism. The present study demonstrates that OTA could promote PCV2 replication as measured by cap protein expression, viral titer, viral DNA copies and the number of infected cells. In addition, OTA could activate autophagy as indicated by up-regulated light chain 3 (LC3)-II and autophagy-related protein 5 expressions and autophagosome formation. Further, OTA could down-regulate p-AKT and p-mTOR expressions and OTA-induced autophagy was inhibited when insulin was applied. SeMet at 2, 4 and 6 \u03BCM had significant inhibiting effects against OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion. Furthermore, SeMet could attenuate OTA-induced autophagy and up-regulate OTA-induced p-AKT and p-mTOR expression inhibition. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of AKT/mTOR, could reverse the effects of SeMet on OTA-induced autophagy and the PCV2 replication promotion. In conclusion, SeMet could block OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion by inhibiting autophagy by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Therefore, SeMet supplementation could be an effective prophylactic strategy against PCV2 infections and autophagy may be a potential marker to develop novel anti-PCV2 drugs.","publish_time":"2018-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Gang; Liu, Dandan; Hu, Junfa; Gan, Fang; Hou, Lili; Zhai, Nianhui; Chen, Xingxiang; Huang, Kehe","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f2216e3b39b7303a9e4d7df96874542c853a3a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5812231.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-018-0508-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29439710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rapamycin"],"organizations":["OTA","AKT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OTA-induced autophagy","OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion","OTA-induced p-AKT","PCV2 infections","effects of SeMet","SeMet supplementation","autophagy-related protein","p-mTOR expressions","novel anti-PCV2 drugs","p-mTOR expression inhibition","inhibitor of AKT","mTOR pathway","potential mechanism","effects of selenomethionine","significant inhibiting effects","previous study","present study","cap protein expression","Porcine circovirus type","viral titer","potential marker","underlying mechanism","viral DNA copies","causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases","major component of organic selenium","effective prophylactic strategy","\u03BCM","number of infected cells","autophagosome formation","low doses of ochratoxin","LC3","light chain","Rapamycin","insulin","conclusion","addition","aim"],"language":"en"},

Since the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, the scale of PHW in China has been continuously expanding, but policymakers and researchers still focus on the distribution of public health personnel, especially the regional inequality in such distribution. We aimed to identify the root cause of PHW inequality by decomposing different geographical units in China. METHODS: This study was based on data from a nationwide survey, which included 2712 county-level data. The distribution of the PHW in geographical units was evaluated by the Gini coefficient and Theil T index, and inequalities at regional, provincial, and municipal levels were decomposed to identify the root causes of inequalities in the PHW. Additionally, the contextual factors affecting the distribution of the PHW were determined through regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall inequality results show that health professional and field epidemiological investigators faced worse inequality than the staff. In particular, field epidemiological investigators had a Gini coefficient close to 0.4. Step decomposition showed that within-region inequalities accounted for 98.5% or more of overall inter-county inequality in the distribution of all PHW categories; provincial decomposition showed that at least 74% of inequality is still distributed within provinces; the overall contribution of within-municipal inequality and between-municipal inequality was basically the same. Further, the contextual factor that influenced between-municipality and within-municipality inequality for all three categories of PHWs was the agency building area per employee. Per capita GDP had a similar effect, except for between-municipality inequality of professionals and within-municipality inequality of field epidemiological investigators. CONCLUSIONS: The successive decomposition showed that inequality is mainly concentrated in counties at the within-province and within-municipal levels. This study clearly suggests that the government, especially the municipal government at the provincial level, should increase financial investment in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) with worse resource allocation in their jurisdiction through various ways of compensation and incentives, enhance their infrastructure, and improve the salary of personnel in these institutions, to attract more public health professionals to these institutions.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Weiqin; Li, Chengyue; Sun, Mei; Hao, Mo","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12c70c4d576fce0b20fce2b35e47b05baea97e35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6873429.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-019-1073-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752854/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHW","Theil T","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["municipal inequality","worse inequality","regional inequality","municipality inequality of professionals","overall inequality results","root cause of PHW inequality","municipality inequality of field epidemiological investigators","overall inter-county inequality","PHW categories","distribution of public health personnel","scale of PHW","public health professionals","municipal government","municipal levels","public health workforce","provincial decomposition","country\u2019s public health system","provincial level","overall contribution","institutions","county-level data","root causes of inequalities","region inequalities","successive decomposition","Step decomposition","China","study","Gini coefficient close","different geographical units","categories of PHWs","salary of personnel","contextual factors","worse resource allocation","Disease Control","jurisdiction","Prevention","CDCs","financial investment","key component","Theil T index","various ways of compensation","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Centers","outbreak of SARS","incentives","agency","similar effect","area","infrastructure","nationwide survey","BACKGROUND","provinces","staff","employee","GDP","CONCLUSIONS","researchers","regression analysis","counties","policymakers","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were employed as surrogates for naked and enveloped viruses, respectively, to set up the methodology. Initial experimentation in small-volume samples showed that both types of particles readily adsorbed to the positively charged glass wool but were poorly detached from it through standard elution with 0.05 M glycine with 3% of beef extract buffer, pH 9.5, with elution efficiencies of 7.2% and 2.6%, for HAV and TGEV, respectively. To improve the recovery of enveloped viruses, several modifications in the elution were assayed: increasing the elution pH, extending glass wool and eluent contact time, adding a detergent, or performing the elution by recirculation or under agitation. Considering practicability and performance, recircularization of the eluent at pH 11.0 for 20 min was the elution procedure of choice, with efficiencies of 25.7% and 18.8% for HAV and TGEV in 50 L of water. Additionally, employing 20% PEG instead of 10% for virus reconcentration improved recoveries up to 47% and 51%, respectively. The optimized procedure was applied to detect naturally occurring HAV and coronaviruses in surface water of Wadi Hanifa, Riyadh. HAV was detected in 38% of the samples, while one sample was positive for an alphacoronavirus.

A protective role of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins against CMV disease has been reported after transplantation, but the impact in HIV-infected patients is unclear. METHODS: In a case-control study nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, we investigated associations between plasma levels of MBL/ficolins and CMV disease. We compared HIV-infected patients with CMV disease (cases) to CMV-seropositive patients without CMV disease (controls) matched for CD4 T-cells, sampling time, and use of combination antiretroviral therapy. MBL and M-ficolin, L-ficolin, and H-ficolin were quantified using ELISA. RESULTS: We analysed 105 cases and 105 matched controls. CMV disease was neither associated with MBL (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per log(10) ng/mL increase (95% CI 0.73\u20131.45)) nor with ficolins (OR per log(10) ng/mL increase 0.66 (95% CI 0.28\u20131.52), 2.34 (95% CI 0.44\u201312.36), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.26\u20133.03) for M-ficolin, L-ficolin, and H-ficolin, respectively). We found no evidence of a greater association between MBL and CMV disease in patients with low CD4 counts; however in the multivariable analysis, CMV disease was more likely in patients with an increased HIV RNA (OR 1.53 per log(10) copies/mL; 95% CI 1.08\u20132.16), or a shorter duration of HIV-infection (OR 0.91 per year; 95% CI 0.84\u20130.98).

Emerging infections have the potential to cause severe human illness and death, and to spread among human populations and across geographic borders. Direct costs associated with emerging infections are often high, caused by prolonged patient management, hospitalization, and convalescence. Indirect costs are caused by absenteeism from work, death, and permanent removal from the workforce. There may be additional costs if precautionary prevention measures are required, based on the known or potential risk. These costs result from culling and prohibited trade in animals and animal-based products if infected animals are a continuing threat to humans; or from postponement or cancellation of travel and tourism if transmission in the general population is uncontrolled. Emerging infections sometimes cause panic and/or fear because of misunderstanding of the risk, and can lead to actions that result in economic loss similar to that caused by legitimate public health precautionary measures. They include reactions such as avoiding animal-based foods mistakenly thought to be the source of infection; unnecessary cancelling travel plans to avoid geographic areas where there is a perception of risk of infection; and/or unwarranted culling of animals or destruction of animal-based foods. If the misunderstanding is transmitted widely by the press or through social media networks, the negative economic impact can be amplified. Economic loss caused by these perceived risks can generally not be disentangled from the losses causes by public health measures that may be in place, but it is thought that at times they add significantly to the economic burden. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were designed to respond to the international spread of infectious disease outbreaks in a manner that prevents unnecessary negative economic impacts. Agreed by all Member States of the World Health Organization in 2005, they are a legally binding global agreement with the specific purpose of ensuring maximum security against the international spread of diseases, with a minimum interference in world traffic and trade. They reflect current understanding of infectious disease risks, especially those that emerge at the animal/human interface; the realization that infectious diseases cannot be stopped from entering countries at borders; the vast increase in access to information through the internet; and globalization that increases the speed with which infectious diseases spread. Under the IHR, countries are able to work transparently with WHO and its scientific experts and collaborating laboratories to conduct joint risk assessments of public health events such as outbreaks of infectious diseases; to make evidence-based recommendations to help prevent or control their international spread; and, by providing valid and transparent information to national focal points, to help prevent unnecessary panic and misunderstanding about risk.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heymann, D.

Biomarkers of disease severity might help in clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical predictiveness of NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio in bronchiolitis. METHODS: Previously healthy children less than 24 months of age with bronchiolitis were recruited from the Texas Children\u0027s emergency room and intensive care unit from October 2010 to April 2011. Demographic, clinical information, and NW samples were obtained at enrollment. NW samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses, caspase 3/7, and LDH. RESULTS: A viral pathogen was detected in 91\u00B76% of 131 children, with the most common being respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus. A single infection was found in 61\u00B78% of subjects and co-infection in 29\u00B78%. Children admitted to ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH than children sent home from the ER or admitted to the general floor (P = 0\u00B702). Children infected with RSV had the highest NW-LDH concentration (P = 0\u00B703) compared with other viral infections. NW-LDH and NW-caspase were significantly correlated (r = 0\u00B777, P \u003C 0\u00B70001). The univariate models showed NW-LDH and NW-LDH/NW- caspase 3/7 ratio were directly associated with hospitalization. Mutivariate regression analyses suggested a complex interaction between the biomarkers, demographics, and disposition. CONCLUSIONS: NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7 and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio and their interactions with demographic factors are predictive of bronchiolitis severity and can help distinguish children requiring ICU-level care from those admitted to the general floor, or discharged home from the emergency center.","publish_time":"2014-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, Reena; Scheffler, Margaret; Tapia, Lorena; Aideyan, Letisha; Patel, Kirtida D; Jewell, Alan M; Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Mei, Minghua; Garofalo, Roberto P; Piedra, Pedro A","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20c5f4025a94ca3a48d6d8a23a9db2ebc8b5ec03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4262276.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132512/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12276","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDH","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NW-caspase","NW- caspase","NW samples","higher NW-LDH","highest NW-LDH concentration","clinical predictiveness of NW","healthy children","predictive of bronchiolitis severity","clinical information","clinical management","general floor","home","ICU-level care","Biomarkers of disease severity","demographic factors","respiratory viruses","emergency center","viral pathogen","co-infection","single infection","viral infections","intensive care unit","respiratory syncytial virus","leading cause of hospitalization","Texas Children\u0027s emergency room","complex interaction","interactions","human rhinovirus","Mutivariate regression analyses","demographics","RSV","months of age","univariate models","infants","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","subjects","disposition","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","enrollment"],"language":"en"},

Here, a DNA molecule was enzymatically synthesized in vitro from DNA templates made from oligonucleotides representing the text of the first Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) sequence elucidated in 1982. No infectious DNA molecule of that seminal reference sequence exists, so the goal was to synthesize it and then build viral chimeras. RESULTS: RNA was transcribed from synthetic DNA and encapsidated with capsid protein in vitro to make synthetic virions. Plants inoculated with the virions did not develop symptoms. When two nucleotide mutations present in the original sequence, but not present in most other TMV sequences in GenBank, were altered to reflect the consensus, the derivative synthetic virions produced classic TMV symptoms. Chimeras were then made by exchanging TMV capsid protein DNA with Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) capsid protein DNA. Virus expressing ToMV capsid protein exhibited altered, ToMV-like symptoms in Nicotiana sylvestris. A hybrid ORF6 protein unknown to nature, created by substituting the capsid protein genes in the virus, was found to be a major symptom determinant in Nicotiana benthamiana. Virus expressing BSMV capsid protein did not have an extended host range to barley, but did produce novel symptoms in N. benthamiana. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of the chemical synthesis and artificial assembly of a plant virus corrects a long-standing error in the TMV reference genome sequence and reveals that unnatural hybrid virus proteins can alter symptoms unexpectedly.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, Bret","journal":"Genome Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a6327ac7ce00c6d5b2bffd0ff65c8476d94760b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4072989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887356/; https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2014-15-5-r67","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["N. benthamiana"],"organizations":["TMV","BSMV"],"locations":["Nicotiana"],"keyphrases":["TMV capsid protein DNA","ToMV capsid protein","BSMV capsid protein","synthetic DNA","capsid protein genes","plant virus","Tomato mosaic virus","Tobacco mosaic virus","classic TMV symptoms","Barley stripe mosaic virus","DNA templates","unnatural hybrid virus proteins","TMV reference genome sequence","TMV sequences","infectious DNA molecule","novel symptoms","hybrid ORF6 protein unknown","derivative synthetic virions","original sequence","Synthetic biology","seminal reference sequence","Nicotiana benthamiana","Nicotiana sylvestris","viral chimeras","nucleotide mutations present","long-standing error","artificial assembly","discipline","text","nature","chemical synthesis","report","major symptom determinant","extended host range","life forms","BACKGROUND","oligonucleotides","consensus","RNA","chemicals","RESULTS","GenBank","goal","CONCLUSIONS","Plants"],"language":"en"},

By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes.

Subsequently, SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) were found in palm civets from live animal markets in Guangdong and in various horseshoe bat species, which were believed to be the ultimate reservoir of SARSr-CoV. Till November 2018, 339 SARSr-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 274 from human, 18 from civets and 47 from bats [mostly from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), n = 30; and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), n = 9]. The human SARS-CoVs and civet SARSr-CoVs were collected in 2003/2004, while bat SARSr-CoVs were continuously isolated in the past 13 years even after the cessation of the SARS epidemic. SARSr-CoVs belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously lineage B) of genus Betacoronavirus and occupy a unique phylogenetic position. Overall, it is observed that the SARSr-CoV genomes from bats in Yunnan province of China possess the highest nucleotide identity to those from civets. It is evident from both multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular SARSr-CoV from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nucleotide identity to the corresponding genes of SARSr-CoV from human/civets, resulting in the shift of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees. Our current model on the origin of SARS is that the human SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic in 2002/2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of SARSr-CoV ancestors in different horseshoe bat species.","publish_time":"2019-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luk, Hayes K.H.; Li, Xin; Fung, Joshua; Lau, Susanna K.P.; Woo, Patrick C.Y.","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/671291d6b0141d9920ffc82e45bc9aef32c6b391.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106202.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134819300310; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.03.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134819300310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30844511/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["SARSr-CoV genomes","particular SARSr-CoV","bat SARSr-CoVs","civet SARSr-CoVs","human SARS-CoVs","number of SARSr","corresponding genes of SARSr","SARS-related CoVs","CoV ancestors","SARS epidemic","ultimate reservoir of SARSr","origin of SARS","cause of SARS","greater horseshoe bats","Chinese horseshoe bats","different horseshoe bat species","phylogenetic analyses","various horseshoe bat species","palm civets","different phylogenetic trees","shift of phylogenetic position","unique phylogenetic position","highest nucleotide identity","lower nucleotide identity","southern China","Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","Rhinolophus sinicus","multiple alignment","Yunnan province of China","result of multiple recombination events","Guangdong","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","live animal markets","genus Betacoronavirus","lineage B","subgenus Sarbecovirus","cessation","years","current model","emergence"],"language":"en"},

However, most studies have focused on respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus infections and none of them have compared the long-term evolution of single versus double or multiple viral infections. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the frequency of asthma development at 6\u20138 years in children with previous admission for bronchiolitis associated with single versus double or multiple viral infection. PATIENTS \u0026 METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 244 children currently aged 6\u20138 years, previously admitted due to bronchiolitis between September 2008 and December 2011. A structured clinical interview and the ISAAC questionnaire for asthma symptoms for 6-7-year-old children, were answered by parents by telephone. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate for virological study (polymerase chain reaction) and clinical data were prospectively taken during admission for bronchiolitis. RESULTS: Median current age at follow-up was 7.3 years (IQR: 6.7\u20138.1). The rate of recurrent wheezing was 82.7% in the coinfection group and 69.7% in the single-infection group, p = 0.06. The number of wheezing-related admissions was twice as high in coinfections than in single infections, p = 0.004. Regarding the ISAAC questionnaire, 30.8% of coinfections versus 15% of single infections, p = 0.01, presented \u201Cwheezing in the last 12 months\u201D, data that strongly correlate with current prevalence of asthma. \u201CDry cough at night\u201D was also reported more frequently in coinfections than in single infections, p = 0.02. The strongest independent risk factors for asthma at 6\u20138 years of age were: age \u003E 9 months at admission for bronchiolitis (OR: 3.484; CI95%: 1.459\u20138.317, p:0.005), allergic rhinitis (OR: 5.910; 95%CI: 2.622\u201313.318, p\u003C0.001), and viral coinfection-bronchiolitis (OR: 3.374; CI95%: 1.542\u20137.386, p:0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Asthma at 6\u20138 years is more frequent and severe in those children previously hospitalized with viral coinfection-bronchiolitis compared with those with single infection. Allergic rhinitis and older age at admission seem also to be strong independent risk factors for asthma development in children previously hospitalised because of bronchiolitis.","publish_time":"2017-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Garcia, Maria Luz; Calvo, Cristina; Ruiz, Sara; Pozo, Francisco; del Pozo, Victoria; Remedios, Laura; Exposito, Nadia; Tellez, Ana; Casas, Inmaculada","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9e9725fa45ef23dc18f0b691cc3f84d9d4a3832.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5716580.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206851/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ISAAC"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single infections","viral coinfection-bronchiolitis","development of asthma","years of age","acute bronchiolitis","Viral respiratory infections","multiple viral infections","asthma symptoms","single-infection group","frequency of asthma development","rhinovirus infections","current prevalence of asthma","long-term evolution of single","year-old children","coinfections","previous admission","older age","coinfection group","Median current age","clinical data","ISAAC questionnaire","allergic rhinitis","months","number of wheezing","CI95","strong independent risk factors","strongest independent risk factors","rate of recurrent wheezing","virological study","cross-sectional study","respiratory syncytial virus","structured clinical interview","polymerase chain reaction","follow-up","Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate","key role","related admissions","RESULTS","PATIENTS","METHODS","studies","parents","BACKGROUND","Dry cough","night","aim","IQR","childhood","OBJECTIVE","telephone","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Control measures are essential to interrupt the transmission and to manage outbreaks effectively. AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to verify the causes and problems contributing to transmission and to identify control measures during outbreaks in LTCFs. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for articles published from 2007 to 2018. Articles written in English reporting outbreaks in LTCFs were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk-of-bias assessment tool for nonrandomized studies. FINDINGS: A total of 37 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The most commonly reported single pathogen was influenza virus, followed by group A streptococcus (GAS). Of the studies that identified the cause, about half of them noted outbreaks transmitted via person-to-person. Suboptimal infection control practice including inadequate decontamination and poor hand hygiene was the most frequently raised issue propagating transmission. Especially, lapses in specific care procedures were linked with outbreaks of GAS and hepatitis B and C viruses. About 60% of the included studies reported affected cases among staff, but only a few studies implemented work restriction during outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that the violation of basic infection control practice could be a major role in introducing and facilitating the spread of contagious diseases in LTCFs. It shows the need to promote compliance with basic practices of infection control to prevent outbreaks in LTCFs.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Min Hye; Lee, Gyeoung Ah; Lee, Seong Hyeon; Park, Yeon-Hwan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99bbd2818ef25a650c7057841b9679208fa1fdf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7064182.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32155208/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LTCFs","outbreaks of GAS","included studies","Control measures","nonrandomized studies","English reporting outbreaks","Suboptimal infection control practice","basic practices of infection control","violation of basic infection control practice","articles","AIM","person","spread of contagious diseases","spread of contagious pathogens","raised issue propagating transmission","systematic review","specific care procedures","unique characteristics of long-term care facilities","inadequate decontamination","poor hand hygiene","bias assessment tool","hepatitis B","compliance","staff","host factors","C viruses","conditions","risk","causes","affected cases","major role","influenza virus","single pathogen","BACKGROUND","electronic databases","lapses","need","work restriction","METHODS","streptococcus","problems","FINDINGS","total","qualitative synthesis","half","CONCLUSIONS","quality"],"language":"en"},

As well as specific symptoms such as nasal problems and fever, these illnesses are associated with a behavioural malaise. One feature of this malaise is reduced alertness and this has been confirmed using subjective reports and objective measures of performance. Such effects have been obtained with both experimentally induced infections and in studies of naturally occurring illnesses. The mechanisms underlying the effects are unclear but possibly reflect effects of cytokines on the CNS which result in changes in neurotransmitter functioning that lead to reduced alertness.

Panning this library against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 subunit identified fully human single-domain antibodies targeting five distinct epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of these antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting a cryptic epitope located in the spike trimeric interface.

Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae. Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat. Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.","publish_time":"2017-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anthony, S.

The trigger for activation of apoptosis is regulated by an intricate interplay between cellular and viral proteins, with a strong bearing on IAV replication. Though the knowledge of viral proteins and mechanisms employed by IAV to induce apoptosis has advanced considerably of late, we know relatively little about the repertoire of host factors targeted by viral proteins. Thus, identification of cellular proteins that are hijacked by the virus will help us not only to understand the molecular underpinnings of IAV-induced apoptosis, but also to design future antiviral therapies. Here we show that the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV directly interacts with and suppresses the expression of API5, a host antiapoptotic protein that antagonizes E2F1-dependent apoptosis. siRNA-mediated depletion of API5, in NP-overexpressed as well as IAV-infected cells, leads to upregulation of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), a downstream modulator of E2F1-mediated apoptosis, and cleavage of caspases 9 and 3, although a reciprocal pattern of these events was observed on ectopic overexpression of API5. In concordance with these observations, annexin V and 7AAD staining assays exhibit downregulation of early and late apoptosis in IAV-infected or NP-transfected cells on overexpression of API5. Most significantly, while overexpression of API5 decreases viral titers, cellular NP protein as well as mRNA levels in IAV-infected A549 cells, silencing of API5 expression causes a steep rise in the same parameters. From the data reported in this manuscript, we propose a proapoptotic role for NP in IAV pathogenesis, whereby it suppresses expression of antiapoptotic factor API5, thus potentiating the E2F1-dependent apoptotic pathway and ensuring viral replication.","publish_time":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mayank, A K; Sharma, S; Nailwal, H; Lal, S K","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb6e2ba036db0dcd7515f6c8b74938e89201b8ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4720893.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2015.360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26673663/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV pathogenesis","IAV replication","IAV-infected cells","Apoptosis of host cells","mediated apoptosis","late apoptosis","IAV-infected A549 cells","E2F1-dependent apoptosis","induced apoptosis","activation of apoptosis","silencing of API5 expression","molecular underpinnings of IAV","ectopic overexpression of API5","viral replication","expression of antiapoptotic factor API5","NP-transfected cells","cellular NP protein","knowledge of viral proteins","viral titers","siRNA-mediated depletion of API5","identification of cellular proteins","host antiapoptotic protein","E2F1-dependent apoptotic pathway","events","virus propagation","downstream modulator of E2F1","repertoire of host factors","upregulation of apoptotic protease","AAD staining assays","mRNA levels","downregulation of early","annexin V","APAF1","dissemination","proapoptotic role","influenza","strong bearing","intricate interplay","mechanisms","steep rise","observations","cleavage of caspases","manuscript","concordance","future antiviral therapies","parameters","reciprocal pattern","trigger","nucleoprotein","data"],"language":"en"},

E gene encodes a small multifunctional protein that possesses ion channel (IC) activity, an important function in virus-host interaction. To test the contribution of E protein IC activity in virus pathogenesis, two recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs, each containing one single amino acid mutation that suppressed ion conductivity, were engineered. After serial infections, mutant viruses, in general, incorporated compensatory mutations within E gene that rendered active ion channels. Furthermore, IC activity conferred better fitness in competition assays, suggesting that ion conductivity represents an advantage for the virus. Interestingly, mice infected with viruses displaying E protein IC activity, either with the wild-type E protein sequence or with the revertants that restored ion transport, rapidly lost weight and died. In contrast, mice infected with mutants lacking IC activity, which did not incorporate mutations within E gene during the experiment, recovered from disease and most survived. Knocking down E protein IC activity did not significantly affect virus growth in infected mice but decreased edema accumulation, the major determinant of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to death. Reduced edema correlated with lung epithelia integrity and proper localization of Na(\u002B)/K(\u002B) ATPase, which participates in edema resolution. Levels of inflammasome-activated IL-1\u03B2 were reduced in the lung airways of the animals infected with viruses lacking E protein IC activity, indicating that E protein IC function is required for inflammasome activation. Reduction of IL-1\u03B2 was accompanied by diminished amounts of TNF and IL-6 in the absence of E protein ion conductivity. All these key cytokines promote the progression of lung damage and ARDS pathology. In conclusion, E protein IC activity represents a new determinant for SARS-CoV virulence.","publish_time":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; DeDiego, Marta L.; Verdi\u00E1-B\u00E1guena, Carmina; Jimenez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Casta\u00F1o-Rodriguez, Carlos; Alcaraz, Antonio; Torres, Jaume; Aguilella, Vicente M.; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fc5e9665de47ef816e11dea365d068d1d1a77e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4006877.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E protein IC function","E gene","contribution of E protein IC activity","absence of E protein ion conductivity","wild-type E protein sequence","small multifunctional protein","ion transport","infected mice","virus pathogenesis","virus growth","active ion channels","Reduced edema","virus-host interaction","SARS-CoV virulence","mutant viruses","lung airways","edema resolution","activated IL","Reduction of IL","major determinant of acute respiratory distress syndrome","lung epithelia integrity","decreased edema accumulation","progression of lung damage","new determinant","Deletion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","important function","compensatory mutations","ARDS pathology","Levels of inflammasome","inflammasome activation","recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs","competition assays","single amino acid mutation","better fitness","envelope","revertants","proper localization of Na","animals","experiment","mutants","diminished amounts of TNF","conclusion","key cytokines","serial infections","lost weight","advantage","disease","ATPase","contrast","death"],"language":"en"},

This disorder is marked by acute inflammation, edema, damage of epithelial cells lining small airways, and augmentation of mucus production. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to identify agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary and academic medical center in the State of Qatar. The study included infants and young children aged 0\u201324 months who were admitted to our pediatric ward with diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (2010\u20132012) RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five infants and young children met the study inclusion criteria with mean age at diagnosis of 3.61\u00B13.56 months. Respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on 769 (92.0%) of the participants. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was positive in 352 (45.7%) children admitted with clinical bronchiolitis. In addition, no viruses were identified in 142 (18.4%) of those admitted, and respiratory viruses other RSV were found in 275 (35.7%) of the children. Our investigations and observations show that there has been a steady and periodic seasonal variation in the RSV rate over the study period. A seasonal trend for the RSV (detected by respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction) rate was evident, showing annual peaks in the months of October, November, December, and January, with a significant test for seasonality (test statistics [T]=3.15, P=0.009). CONCLUSION: In countries with desert hot weather, bronchiolitis might affect children throughout the year. Our results suggest that the combination of date regarding uninterrupted RSV seasonality can provide guidance for health care planning and application of RSV prevention scheme, such as extending the palivizumab immunoglobulin series.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hendaus, Mohamed A; Alhammadi, Ahmed H; Chandra, Prem; Muneer, Eshan; Khalifa, Mohamed S","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ea6161f1a3799d02f910658992bc4df2a1cefae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5901157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29692622/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s154424","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hamad Medical Corporation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["young children","RSV rate","respiratory viruses","uninterrupted RSV seasonality","Respiratory syncytial virus","infants","study period","diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis","clinical bronchiolitis","months","Respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction","study inclusion criteria","cross-sectional retrospective study","application of RSV prevention scheme","State of Qatar","RESULTS","frequent lower respiratory tract infection","test statistics","acute inflammation","significant test","seasonal trend","Hamad Medical Corporation","academic medical center","periodic seasonal variation","guidance","health care planning","small airways","damage of epithelial cells","tertiary","desert hot weather","edema","countries","mean age","combination of date","pediatric ward","augmentation of mucus production","METHODS","annual peaks","MATERIALS","CONCLUSION","agents","palivizumab immunoglobulin series","disorder","OBJECTIVE","goal","year","investigations","observations","addition","BACKGROUND","participants"],"language":"en"},

Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showed affinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30 vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity, human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptides contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA alleles accounting for ~99% of Chinese population.

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells is a high priority for deciphering its mystery and curbing its spread. A virus surface spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. To fulfill its function, SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. Here we investigated receptor binding and protease activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays. Our findings have identified key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry. Second, paradoxically, the hACE2 binding affinity of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike is comparable to or lower than that of SARS-CoV spike, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit more potent, is less exposed than SARS-CoV RBD. Third, unlike SARS-CoV, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is preactivated by proprotein convertase furin, reducing its dependence on target cell proteases for entry. The high hACE2 binding affinity of the RBD, furin preactivation of the spike, and hidden RBD in the spike potentially allow SARS-CoV-2 to maintain efficient cell entry while evading immune surveillance. These features may contribute to the wide spread of the virus. Successful intervention strategies must target both the potency of SARS-CoV-2 and its evasiveness.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shang, Jian; Wan, Yushun; Luo, Chuming; Ye, Gang; Geng, Qibin; Auerbach, Ashley; Li, Fang","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376634/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003138117","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV spike","SARS-CoV RBD","entire SARS-CoV","cell entry of SARS","potency of SARS","protease activation of SARS","key cell entry mechanisms of SARS","efficient cell entry","receptor binding","hidden RBD","high hACE2 binding affinity","higher hACE2 binding affinity","receptor-binding domain","pseudovirus entry assays","target cell proteases","virus surface spike protein","human cells","human proteases","receptor human ACE2","furin preactivation","high priority","wide spread","proprotein convertase furin","global coronavirus disease","dependence","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome","COVID","findings","immune surveillance","mystery","Successful intervention strategies","features","function","pandemic","evasiveness"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to study factors associated with delay before registration at country level among registered migrant TB patients in China (2014\u201315) who were transferred out (during treatment) through web-based TB information management system (TBIMS). METHODS: This was a cross sectional study involving review of TBIMS data. Delays (in days) were classified as follows: patient delay (from symptom onset to first doctor visit), health system delay (from first doctor visit to treatment initiation, divided into health system diagnosis and treatment delay before and after date of diagnosis respectively), diagnosis delay (from symptom onset to diagnosis) and total delay (from symptom onset to treatment initiation). Linear regression was used to build a predictive model (forward stepwise) for the socio-demographic, clinical and health system related factors associated with delay: one model for each type of delay. Delays were log transformed and included in the model. RESULTS: The median (IQR) patient delay, health system delay and total delay was 16 (6, 34), two (0, 6) and 22 (11, 41) days respectively. Factors associated with long patient, diagnosis and total delay were: female gender, age \u2265 65 years, sputum smear positive pulmonary TB and registration at referral hospital. Treatment initiation delay was significantly higher among those registered in referral hospitals, unemployed and previously treated. Among migrant patients having permanent residence out of province, health system diagnosis delay was significantly higher while treatment initiation delay after diagnosis was significantly lower when compared to patients having permanent residence within the prefecture. CONCLUSION: Among migrant population with TB, patient delay contributed to the total delay. The factors identified including the need for improved coordination between referral hospitals and national programme have to be addressed if China has to end TB.

However, there are also a number of pathological conditions, including autoimmunity and cancer, in which the activities of neutrophils can be harmful to the host. Thus the activities of neutrophils need to be tightly controlled. As in the case of other immune cells, many of the neutrophil effector functions are regulated by a series of immunoreceptors on the plasma membrane. Here, we review what is currently known about the functions of the various individual immunoreceptors and their signaling in neutrophils. While these immunoreceptors allow for the recognition of a diverse range of extracellular ligands, such as cell surface structures (like proteins, glycans and lipids) and extracellular matrix components, they commonly signal via conserved ITAM or ITIM motifs and their associated downstream pathways that depend on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins and/or inositol lipids. This allows for a balanced homeostatic regulation of neutrophil effector functions. Given the number of available immunoreceptors and their fundamental importance for neutrophil behavior, it is perhaps not surprising that pathogens have evolved means to evade immune responses through some of these pathways. Inversely, some of these receptors evolved to specifically recognize these pathogens. Finally, some interactions mediated by immunoreceptors in neutrophils have been identified as promising targets for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Rees, Dieke J.; Szilagyi, Katka; Kuijpers, Taco W.; Matlung, Hanke L.; van den Berg, Timo K.","journal":"Seminars in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b88d3afa67b5df16c9c2287d0683fe6fc742d7fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129252.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532316000075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044532316000075; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2016.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26976825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ITIM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activities of neutrophils","series of immunoreceptors","Abstract Neutrophils","number of available immunoreceptors","various individual immunoreceptors","proteins","balanced homeostatic regulation of neutrophil effector functions","neutrophil behavior","pathogens","variety of effector mechanisms","host defense","inositol lipids","immune cells","immune responses","extracellular matrix components","associated downstream pathways","number of pathological conditions","diverse range of extracellular ligands","ITIM motifs","glycans","critical role","fundamental importance","cell surface structures","conserved ITAM","cancer","autoimmunity","infection","phosphorylation of tyrosine residues","promising targets","recognition","therapeutic intervention","purpose","plasma membrane","case","interactions"],"language":"en"},

This paper shares the experiences, achievements and opportunities of this partnership in co-learning and supporting the health system in Uganda. This includes a project being implemented to strengthen the training, supervision and motivation of community health workers in rural Uganda. Training and research are a key focus of the partnership and have involved both staff and students of both institutions including guest lectures, seminars and conference presentations. The partnership\u2019s collaboration with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health (Uganda) and local health authorities has ensured participation necessary in supporting implementation of sustainable interventions. The partnership uses several channels such as email, telephone, Skype, Dropbox and WhatsApp which have been useful in maintaining constant and effective communication. The challenges faced by the partnership include lack of funding to support student mobility, and varying academic schedules of the two institutions. The experiences and prospects of this growing partnership can inform other collaborations in similar settings.","publish_time":"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Musoke, David; Gibson, Linda; Mukama, Trasias; Khalil, Yesmean; Ssempebwa, John C.","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34081c03e48678c7d7633e81cecdeb0b6dbf30e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4818423.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-016-0148-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nottingham Trent University","Makerere University School of Public Health","WhatsApp"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health systems","Ministry of Health","Inter-university health collaboration","local health authorities","growing partnership","contemporary global health challenges","motivation of community health workers","Makerere University School of Public Health","training","rural Uganda","opportunities","country institutions","research","experiences","Nottingham Trent University","partnership\u2019s collaboration","participation necessary","student mobility","guest lectures","UK","telephone","Dropbox","seminars","varying academic schedules","email","supervision","co-learning","service delivery","lack of funding","WhatsApp","Skype","conference presentations","students","collaborations","stakeholders","achievements","key focus","implementation of sustainable interventions","effective communication","channels","prospects","staff","similar settings","paper","Partnerships","project"],"language":"en"},

However, the exceptional evolutionary plasticity of RNA viruses threatens the durability of the resistance conferred by these amiRs. It has recently been shown that viral populations not experiencing strong selective pressure from an antiviral amiR may already contain enough genetic variability in the target sequence to escape plant resistance in an almost deterministic manner. Furthermore, it has also been shown that viral populations exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of the antiviral amiR speed up this process. In this article, we have characterized the molecular evolutionary dynamics of an amiR target sequence in a viral genome under both conditions. The use of Illumina ultradeep sequencing has allowed us to identify virus sequence variants at frequencies as low as 2 \u00D7 10(\u22126) and to track their variation in time before and after the viral population was able of successfully infecting plants fully resistant to the ancestral virus. We found that every site in the amiR-target sequence of the viral genome presented variation and that the variant that eventually broke resistance was sampled among the many coexisting ones. In this system, viral evolution in fully susceptible plants results from an equilibrium between mutation and genetic drift, whereas evolution in partially resistant plants originates from more complex dynamics involving mutation, selection, and drift.","publish_time":"2012-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez, Fernando; Lafforgue, Guillaume; Morelli, Marco J.; Gonz\u00E1lez-Candelas, Fernando; Chua, Nam-Hai; Dar\u00F2s, Jos\u00E9-Antonio; Elena, Santiago F.","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187544.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/mss135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22593223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral evolution","viral populations","amiR target sequence","amiR-target sequence","viral genomes","antiviral amiR","resistant plants","plant resistance","virus sequence variants","susceptible plants","mutation","genetic drift","broke resistance","amiRs","variation","molecular evolutionary dynamics","complex dynamics","genetic variability","ancestral virus","Plant artificial micro-RNAs","exceptional evolutionary plasticity of RNA viruses","strong selective pressure","equilibrium","subinhibitory concentrations","durability","frequencies","selection","use of Illumina ultradeep sequencing","deterministic manner","time","system","site","degradation","process","conditions","coexisting ones","article"],"language":"en"},

Studies in the populations of Hong Kong and Taiwan showed an association of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms with the development and/or severity of SARS, respectively. The aim of the present study was to define the genotypic patterns of HLA\u2010A, \u2010B and \u2010DRB1 loci in SARS patients and a co\u2010resident population of Guangdong province, southern China, where the first SARS case was reported.

HLA \u2010A, \u2010B and \u2010DRB1 alleles were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction with sequence\u2010specific primers. The severity of the disease was assessed according to the history of lung infiltration, usage of assisted ventilation and occurrence of lymphocytopenia. Although the allelic frequencies of A23, A34, B60, DRB1*12 in the SARS group were slightly higher, and A33, \u2010B58 and \u2010B61 were lower than in the controls, no statistical significance was found when the Pc value was considered. Similarly, no association of HLA alleles with the severity of the disease was detected. Thus, variations in the major histocompatibility complex are unlikely to have contributed significantly to either the susceptibility or the severity of SARS in the population of Guangdong.","publish_time":"2008-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, P.; Zeng, X.; Song, M.

Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a significant pathogen to Bombyx mori, yet also an efficient vector for recombinant protein production. A previous study indicated that acetylation plays many vital roles in several cellular processes of Bombyx mori while global phosphorylation pattern upon BmNPV infection remains elusive. METHOD: Employing tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and phosphorylation affinity enrichment followed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis and intensive bioinformatics analysis, the quantitative phosphoproteome in Bombyx mori cells infected by BmNPV at 24 hpi with an MOI of 10 was extensively examined. RESULTS: Totally, 6480 phosphorylation sites in 2112 protein groups were identified, among which 4764 sites in 1717 proteins were quantified. Among the quantified proteins, 81 up-regulated and 25 down-regulated sites were identified with significant criteria (the quantitative ratio above 1.3 was considered as up-regulation and below 0.77 was considered as down-regulation) and with significant p-value (p \u003C 0.05). Some proteins of BmNPV were also hyperphosphorylated during infection, such as P6.9, 39 K, LEF-6, Ac58-like protein, Ac82-like protein and BRO-D.

In this study, a scaled outdoor experiment was conducted to examine the interunit dispersion characteristics in consecutive two-dimensional street canyons. Tracer gas ( C O 2 ) was continuously released to simulate the pollutant dispersion routes between the rooms in street canyons. The wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, and tracer gas concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Two important parameters, the air exchange rate and reentry ratio, were analyzed to reveal the ventilation performance and interunit dispersion of the rooms in the street canyons. Based on the real-time weather conditions, it was found that the ventilation performance of the source room varied according to the room location. The air exchange rate distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side. The tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction inside the street canyon, and the highest reentry ratio was observed at the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route.

In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2 months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/ immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sol\u00E9, G; Salort-Campana, E; Pereon, Y; Stojkovic, T; Wahbi, K; Cintas, P; Adams, D; Laforet, P; Tiffreau, V; Desguerre, I; Pisella, LI; Molon, A; Attarian, S","journal":"Rev Neurol (Paris)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f1f621978c100415b5dc4befaa15f0f6a579c25.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354651/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2020.04.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0035378720305233; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035378720305233?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMD","NIV"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["NM patients","context of NM diseases","Neuromuscular Diseases Network","management of neuromuscular","NM conditions","experimental COVID","conduct of treatments","good prognosis","ventilator-dependent patients","NIV","special context","epidemic phase of COVID","manifestations suggestive of COVID","unfavorable emergency context","FILNEMUS website","Hospitalization","organization of neuromuscular reference centers","intensive care admission","French Rare Health Care","resuscitation admission","French territory","diagnostic delay","implementation of emergency measures","QT prolongation","risk of exacerbation","myasthenia gravis","multidisciplinary working group","self-rehabilitation","degradation","hydroxycholoroquine","fairest medical decision","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Various support systems","azithromycin","steroid","immunosuppressants","positive criteria","pre-existing cardiac involvement","guided exercises","cardiorespiratory assessments","loss of survival chance","use of noninvasive ventilation","particular attention","SARS-CoV","France","people","potential","absence","dysimmune pathology","period","asked questions","FAQ","sheet","Abstract","Adaptation","order","nebulization","guidance","attempt","emergencies","months","check-ups","national strategy","NMD"],"language":"en"},

Immediately after death, observations were made visually in situ and by radiography. Further observations were made in a museum laboratory setting, prior to and following clearing of soft tissues. Selected dry bone specimens were evaluated using computed tomography. Significant cartilage erosion and osteoarthropathy were identified in all shoulder joints. No single evaluation method yielded maximal information. Plain film radiography revealed only more severe changes. Computed tomography yielded more detail and clarity than standard radiography. Direct examination of articular cartilage informed about joint soft tissue, and dry bone informed about externally visible bone pathology. These data provide a basis for biological, biomedical, ecological, and archaeological scientists to improve retrospective interpretations of bone lesions. They further support developing plausible differential diagnoses for features of ancient and modern animal bones.

Los autores anglosajones hablan de catarro (common cold) o de infecci\u00F3n de v\u00EDas respiratorias altas para describir una inflamaci\u00F3n de las v\u00EDas respiratorias superiores, y de adenoiditis cr\u00F3nica (chronic adenoiditis) para designar una infecci\u00F3n cr\u00F3nica de las vegetaciones adenoides que produce rinorrea febril recidivante u obstrucci\u00F3n de las v\u00EDas respiratorias altas. Las rinofaringitis agudas no complicadas son de origen v\u00EDrico. Habitualmente su evoluci\u00F3n espont\u00E1nea es r\u00E1pida y sin complicaciones.

Objectives To investigate the impact of outdoor weather in a temperate climate setting on the seasonal epidemiology of viruses causing respiratory tract infections, particularly influenza A (IFA). Study design In total, 20,062 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples referred for detection of respiratory pathogens using a multiplex PCR panel, between October 2010 and July 2013, were included. Results of PCR detection were compared with local meteorological data for the same period. Results Low temperature and vapor pressure (VP) were associated with weekly incidence of IFA, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus and adenovirus but no association with relative humidity was found. The incidence of human rhinovirus and enterovirus was independent of temperature. During seasonal IFA outbreaks, the weekly drop of average temperature (compared with the week before) was strongly associated with the IFA incidence recorded the following week. Conclusion A sudden drop in outdoor temperature might activate the annual influenza epidemic in a temperate climate by facilitating aerosol spread in dry air. These conditions also seem to affect the incidence of other respiratory pathogens but not human rhino- or enterovirus, suggesting that routes of infection other than aerosol may be relevant for these agents.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sundell, Nicklas; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Brittain-Long, Robin; Lindh, Magnus; Westin, Johan","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fa7b292673e8a813f723de1d6ddc24ea09b659c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106483.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2016.10.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653216305509; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653216305509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27723525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFA incidence","weekly incidence of IFA","detection of respiratory pathogens","outdoor temperature","seasonal activity of respiratory viruses","seasonal IFA outbreaks","Low temperature","independent of temperature","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory tract infections","incidence of human rhinovirus","weekly drop of average temperature","seasonal epidemiology of viruses","weather conditions","enterovirus","aerosol","Results of PCR detection","temperate climate setting","impact of outdoor weather","sudden drop","following week","annual influenza epidemic","multiplex PCR panel","viral transmission","clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples","adenovirus","total","relation","bocavirus","metapneumovirus","VP","local meteorological data","association","vapor pressure","Abstract Background","Conclusion","Study design","routes of infection","relative humidity","period","dry air","agents","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Despite the usability of IC, the sensitivity is approximately 10(3) pfu per reaction. In addition, antigen-antibody interaction-based method cannot be used for the detection of influenza viruses with major antigenic change. In this study, we established the use of fluorescent immunochromatography (FLIC) to detect a broad spectrum of H5 subtype influenza A viruses. This method has improved sensitivity 10\u2013100 fold higher than traditional IC because of the use of fluorescent conjugated beads. Our Type-E FLIC kit detected all of the H5 subtype influenza viruses that were examined, as well as recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins (rHAs) belonging to the Eurasian H5 subtype viruses and the Type-N diagnosed North American H5 subtype influenza A viruses. Thus, this kit has the improved potential to detect H5 subtype influenza viruses of different clades with both Type-E and Type-N FLIC kits. Compared with PCR-based diagnosis, FLIC has a strong advantage in usability, because the sample preparation required for FLIC is only mix-and-drop without any additional steps such as RNA extraction.

Previously, autoantibodies directed against melanocortin peptides were found in patients with eating disorders; however, it remains unknown whether autoantibodies directed against other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera and whether their levels are influenced by gut-related antigens. Methods Healthy women were studied for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA autoantibodies directed against 14 key appetite-regulating peptides. The concept of molecular mimicry was applied to search in silico whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi contain proteins with amino acid sequences identical to appetite-regulating peptides. In addition, autoantibodies serum levels were studied in germ-free and specific pathogen-free rats. Results We found these IgG and IgA autoantibodies directed against leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, and other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera at levels of 100\u2013900 ng/mL. Numerous cases of sequence homology with these peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli, bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Candida species. Decreased levels of IgA autoantibodies directed against several appetite-regulating peptides and increased levels of antighrelin IgG were found in germ-free rats compared with specific pathogen-free rats. Conclusion Healthy humans and rats display autoantibodies directed against appetite-regulating peptide hormones and neuropeptides, suggesting that these autoantibodies may have physiologic implications in hunger and satiety pathways. Gut-related antigens including the intestinal microflora may influence production of theses autoantibodies, suggesting a new link between the gut and appetite control.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fetissov, Sergue\u00EF O.; Hamze Sinno, Maria; Co\u00EBffier, Mo\u00EFse; Bole-Feysot, Christine; Ducrott\u00E9, Philippe; H\u00F6kfelt, Tomas; D\u00E9chelotte, Pierre","journal":"Nutrition","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f000c7059e15cb6b3b6942cb598c5d4cae53561a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126273.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900707003814; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2007.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18262391/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900707003814","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autoantibodies serum levels","key appetite","appetite control","Decreased levels of IgA autoantibodies","melanocortin peptides","production of theses autoantibodies","germ-free rats","specific pathogen-free rats","gut-related antigens","increased levels of antighrelin IgG","neuropeptides","peptide YY","addition","human sera","Abstract Objective Peptide hormones","Conclusion Healthy humans","Methods Healthy women","bacteroides","amino acid sequences identical","Escherichia coli","Lactobacilli","Helicobacter pylori","fungi","proteins","intestinal microflora","adipose tissues","leptin","new link","search","viruses","pathogenic micro-organisms","physiologic implications","hunger","neuropeptide Y","presence of immunoglobulin","silico","bacteria","satiety pathways","patients","Numerous cases of sequence homology","Candida species","body weight","concept of molecular mimicry","eating disorders"],"language":"en"},

Because TREM2 encodes a receptor exclusively expressed on immune cells, identification of these variants conclusively demonstrates that the immune response can play an active role in the pathogenesis of NDDs. These TREM2 variants also confer the highest risk for developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease of any risk factor identified in nearly two decades, suggesting that understanding more about TREM2 function could provide key insights into NDD pathology and provide avenues for novel immune-related NDD biomarkers and therapeutics. The expression, signaling and function of TREM2 in NDDs have been extensively investigated in an effort to understand the role of immune function in disease pathogenesis and progression. We provide a comprehensive review of our current understanding of TREM2 biology, including new insights into the regulation of TREM2 expression, and TREM2 signaling and function across NDDs. While many open questions remain, the current body of literature provides clarity on several issues. While it is still often cited that TREM2 expression is decreased by pro-inflammatory stimuli, it is now clear that this is true in vitro, but inflammatory stimuli in vivo almost universally increase TREM2 expression. Likewise, while TREM2 function is classically described as promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype, more than half of published studies demonstrate a pro-inflammatory role for TREM2, suggesting that its role in inflammation is much more complex. Finally, these components of TREM2 biology are applied to a discussion of how TREM2 impacts NDD pathologies and the latest assessment of how these findings might be applied to immune-directed clinical biomarkers and therapeutics.","publish_time":"2017-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jay, Taylor R.; von Saucken, Victoria E.; Landreth, Gary E.","journal":"Mol Neurodegener","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac51af9995edb441f0ce4fdc384908daa6e83675.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5541421.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28768545/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-017-0197-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NDD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TREM2 function","function of TREM2","TREM2 variants","regulation of TREM2 expression","components of TREM2 biology","current understanding of TREM2 biology","TREM2 impacts NDD pathologies","role of immune function","immune cells","immune response","pro-inflammatory role","pathogenesis of NDDs","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","active role","disease pathogenesis","novel immune-related NDD biomarkers","pro-inflammatory stimuli","NDD pathology","risk factors","highest risk","therapeutics","new insights","key insights","clinical biomarkers","current body of literature","avenues","discussion","latest assessment","half of published studies","clarity","progression","neurodegenerative diseases","comprehensive review","open questions","findings","identification","receptor","anti-inflammatory phenotype","issues","decades","inflammation","effort"],"language":"en"},

This method is based on the binding of RNA to acid-treated glass beads in the presence of a high molarity of guanidinium salt. It can be completed within an hour, and obviates the need for dewaxing and phenol/chloroform extractions. The effect of various fixatives and fixation times was tested and the amplification of actin mRNA fragments ranging in length from 82 to 507 bp was used to demonstrate the presence of RNA in the extracts. The method was compared to existing extraction techniques by studying the quality of the templates for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR), using virus-infected and mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets as a model. PCR amplification of cellular and viral RNA was successful for RNA isolated by use of all extraction techniques, although the glass bead method was preferred for its simplicity and rapidity. Specimens fixed with formalin were found to be suitable for PCR, but the best results were obtained with acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Dewaxing of tissue sections had no effect on the yield and quality of RNA extractions, and further purification of the extracts using gel filtration did not improve the results. After the protocols were optimized, rotavirus-infected cell pellets were used to demonstrate that extraction and amplification of dsRNA was possible. The information obtained from the studies with the model system was used for extraction of toroviral and rotaviral RNA from archival intestinal material. These data indicate that paraffin-embedded archival tissue can be used for RT-PCR analysis, adding an important technique to diagnostic pathology and retrospective studies.","publish_time":"1993-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koopmans, Marion; Monroe, Stephan S.; Coffield, Lisa M.; Zaki, Sherif R.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a88f5018666185094c4489ecf577251a68940be0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0166093493900764; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166093493900764","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of RNA","rotaviral RNA","binding of RNA","quality of RNA extractions","PCR amplification of cellular","paraffin-embedded tissue sections","paraffin-embedded archival tissue","efficient isolation of RNA","RT-PCR analysis","mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets","subsequent PCR analysis","acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material","extraction of toroviral","amplification of dsRNA","Dewaxing of tissue sections","existing extraction techniques","glass bead method","rotavirus-infected cell pellets","extracts","amplification of actin mRNA fragments","archival intestinal material","reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification","retrospective studies","chloroform extractions","best results","model system","effect of various fixatives","acid-treated glass beads","important technique","diagnostic pathology","templates","fixation times","purification","yield","length","high molarity of guanidinium salt","need","phenol","gel filtration","use","simplicity","data","formalin","bp","protocols","Specimens","rapidity","hour","information"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed at investigating the role of HH molecules in human ovarian carcinogenesis. The expression profiles of HH molecules were examined in ovarian tumor samples and ovarian cancer cell lines and the in vitro effects of HH molecules on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and cell differentiation as well as related downstream target genes were assessed. Overexpression of Patched and Gli1 protein in ovarian cancers correlated with poor survival of the patients (P = 0.008; P = 0.004). Significantly elevated expression of Sonic hedgehog messenger RNA was observed in ovarian cancers compared with normal tissues and benign ovarian tumors and such differential expression was specific to histological types (P \u003C 0.05). Ectopic Gli1 overexpression in ovarian cancer cells conferred increased cell proliferation, cell mobility, invasiveness and change in differentiation in association with increased expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, Bcl-2, caspases as well as \u03B21 integrin, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Treatment with 3-keto-N-(aminoethyl-aminocaproyl-dihydrocinnamoyl)-cyclopamine induced cancer cell apoptosis, suppressed cell growth, mobility and invasiveness and induced cancer cell dedifferentiation with decreased expression of E-cadherin, cytokeratin 7, Snail, calretinin, vimentin, Bcl-2, caspases, \u03B21 integrin, MT1-MMP and VEGF. Our data suggested that abnormal HH signaling activation plays important roles in the development and progression of ovarian cancers. Gli1 expression is an independent prognostic marker.

Highly purified ER membranes from the wild-type and \u0394sac1 yeast strains reconstituted into liposomes transported ATP with the same efficiency. A chromatography on hydroxyapatite was used to partially purify ANTS from \u0394sac1 ER extract. The two ANTS-enriched transport activity eluted fractions showed essentially the presence of four bands, one having an apparent MW of 56 kDa, similar to that observed for ANTS identified in rat liver ER. The two fractions reconstituted into liposomes efficiently transported, by a strict counter-exchange mechanism, ATP and ADP. ATP transport was saturable with a Km of 0.28 mM.

Enteric pathogens were identified in 76 (60%) of cases, whereas the etiology remained unidentified in 50 cases (40%). Patients with an identified pathogen did not differ from those with TD of unknown etiology in terms of the time of onset of illness or the median frequency of unformed stools in the first 24 hours. In contrast, the median frequency of unformed stools between 24 and 48 hours (i.e., on the second day) was 1.0 among patients with no pathogen and 2.0 among those with enteric pathogens identified (P \u003C .001). A similar difference was evident on the third day (1.0 vs. 2.5). Moreover, a lower proportion of patients with no pathogen identified had watery stools (28% vs. 55%). The durations of diarrhea and concomitant symptoms were significantly shorter and the recovery from TD was significantly quicker among the patients without an identified pathogen. Patients with one or more invasive pathogens had disease that was clearly more severe than that of patients with no pathogen identified; the difference in severity of disease was less marked for patients with invasive vs. noninvasive pathogens. Individuals with diarrhea due to Campylobacter species tended to have the most severe disease, whereas diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli seemed milder than that caused by other agents. Unfortunately, the clinician has only a limited opportunity to predict the etiology of TD and thus to assess the need for antimicrobial therapy at the onset of disease.","publish_time":"1994-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mattila, Leena","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db54b1a5c223be36b7381064f20d690920e83ddc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozk30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified pathogen","etiology of TD","onset of disease","severe disease","lower proportion of patients","Enteric pathogens","TD of unknown etiology","durations of diarrhea","severity of disease","noninvasive pathogens","median frequency of unformed stools","illness","watery stools","cases","hours","day","Clinical features of traveler\u0027s diarrhea","time of onset","similar difference","terms","concomitant symptoms","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","recovery","need","antimicrobial therapy","Campylobacter species","limited opportunity","adult Finnish tourists","Individuals","contrast","clinician","visit","Morocco","agents"],"language":"en"},

On the basis of serologic evidence, none of the acute episodes appeared to be due to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 or 2. However, examination of annual serum specimens showed that 27 (52%) of the children had rises in titer of indirect immunofluorescent antibody (a fourfold or greater rise to a reciprocal titer of \u2A7E128). Most rises in titer were in response to the serogroup 2 antigen. These results suggest that L. pneumophila is not a common cause of acute respiratory disease in early childhood in the study area but that children are frequently exposed to the organism.

If we can obtain satisfactory prediction using only nucleotide (sequence) information, it would be more promising. Three groups recently identified essential genes in human cancer cell lines using wet experiments and it provided wonderful opportunity to accomplish our idea. Here we improved the Z curve method into the \u03BB-interval form to denote nucleotide composition and association information and used it to construct the SVM classifying model. RESULTS: Our model accurately predicted human gene essentiality with an AUC higher than 0.88 both for 5-fold cross-validation and jackknife tests. These results demonstrated that the essentiality of human genes could be reliably reflected by only sequence information. We re-predicted the negative dataset by our Pheg server and 118 genes were additionally predicted as essential. Among them, 20 were found to be homologues in mouse essential genes, indicating that some of the 118 genes were indeed essential, however previous experiments overlooked them. As the first available server, Pheg could predict essentiality for anonymous gene sequences of human. It is also hoped the \u03BB-interval Z curve method could be effectively extended to classification issues of other DNA elements.

In the prophylaxis study a total of 57 volunteers received lozenges of either zinc gluconate (23 mg) (29 volunteers) or matched placebo (28 volunteers) every 2 h while awake during a period of four and a half days. They were challenged with 10(2) tissue culture infecting dose (TCID(50)) of human rhinovirus 2 (HRV-2) on the second day of medication, and were monitored daily for symptoms and signs of colds and laboratory evidence of infection. Zinc reduced the total mean clinical score from 8.2 in the placebo group to 5.7 and the reduction of the mean clinical score was statistically significant on the second day after virus challenge. In the therapeutic study 69 volunteers were inoculated with 10(2) TCID(50) of HRV-2 and those who developed cold symptoms were randomly allocated to receive either zinc gluconate lozenges (six volunteers) or matched placebo lozenges (six volunteers) every two hours they were awake for six days. Treatment of colds with zinc reduced the mean daily clinical score and this was statistically significant on the fourth and fifth day of medication. Similarly, medication also reduced the mean daily nasal secretion weight and total tissue count and these reductions were statistically significant on days two and six for nasal secretion weights and days four to six of medication for tissue counts when compared with placebo. There were also statistically significant reductions in the mean total nasal secretion weights and total tissue counts. Zinc, however, had no significant effect on the rate or amount of virus excreted by volunteers. We conclude that zinc gluconate lozenges are reasonably well tolerated and that they have a significant effect on the signs and symptoms of colds caused by rhinoviruses, although the mechanism of action remains obscure.","publish_time":"1987-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Nakib, W.; Higgins, P.G.; Barrow, I.; Batstone, G.; Tyrrell, D.A.J.","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba2cba10f1ff81d8b09474aad6e06e089d529a41.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["volunteers","total tissue","significant effect","total mean clinical score","matched placebo lozenges","prophylactic effect of zinc gluconate lozenges","significant reductions","mean total nasal secretion weights","mean daily clinical score","symptoms of colds","day of medication","mean daily nasal secretion weight","signs of colds","placebo group","therapeutic study","start of colds","tissue culture","Treatment of colds","tolerance study","half days","double-blind placebo controlled trials","rhinovirus challenge","virus inoculation","TCID","cold symptoms","HRV","human rhinovirus","therapeutic efficacy","laboratory evidence of infection","rhinoviruses","mechanism of action","period","dose","rate","hours","prophylaxis"],"language":"en"},

However, the roles of a XO inhibitor, febuxostat (FEB), in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling and hypertension independent of the serum uric acid level remain unclear. METHODS: To induce vascular remodeling in mice, angiotensin II (Ang II) was infused for 2 weeks with a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump. FEB was administered every day during Ang II infusion. Aortic fibrosis was assessed by elastica van Gieson staining. Mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells (RAW) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used for in vitro studies. RESULTS: FEB suppressed Ang II-induced blood pressure elevation and aortic fibrosis. Immunostaining showed that Ang II-induced macrophage infiltration in the aorta tended to be suppressed by FEB, and XO was mainly colocalized in macrophages, not in fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor-\u03B21 (TGF-\u03B21) mRNA expression was induced in the aorta in the Ang II alone group, but not in the Ang II \u002B FEB group. Ang II induced \u03B1-smooth muscle actin-positive fibroblasts in the aortic wall, but FEB suppressed them. XO expression and activity were induced by Ang II stimulation alone but not by Ang II \u002B FEB in RAW. FEB suppressed Ang II-induced TGF-\u03B21 mRNA expression in RAW. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that FEB ameliorates Ang II-induced aortic fibrosis via suppressing macrophage-derived TGF-\u03B21 expression.","publish_time":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kondo, Masateru; Imanishi, Masaki; Fukushima, Keijo; Ikuto, Raiki; Murai, Yoichi; Horinouchi, Yuya; Izawa-Ishizawa, Yuki; Goda, Mitsuhiro; Zamami, Yoshito; Takechi, Kenshi; Chuma, Masayuki; Ikeda, Yasumasa; Fujino, Hiromichi; Tsuchiya, Koichiro; Ishizawa, Keisuke","journal":"Am J Hypertens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba05b195d5fe93bf53efc4feb0a746e6a21e1bac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II","Ang"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suppressed Ang","induced TGF-\u03B21 mRNA expression","XO expression","induced macrophage infiltration","Aortic fibrosis","macrophage-derived TGF-\u03B21 expression","induced blood pressure elevation","aortic wall","XO inhibitor","induced \u03B1-smooth muscle actin-positive fibroblasts","growth factor-\u03B21","Mouse macrophage RAW264","mouse embryonic fibroblasts","aorta","RESULTS","group","pathogenesis of vascular remodeling","clinical studies","hypertension independent","inhibitors","serum uric acid level","cells","suppressive effects","xanthine oxidase","reports","basic researches","elastica van Gieson staining","cardiovascular diseases","mice","angiotensin","activity","weeks","implanted osmotic minipump","BACKGROUND","roles","febuxostat","stimulation","METHODS","day","infusion","macrophages","Immunostaining","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The availability of complete genome sequence of several strains of SARS virus provides the possibility of identification of protein-coding genes and defining their functions. Computational approach to identify protein-coding genes and their putative functions will help in designing experimental protocols. Results: In this paper, a novel analysis of SARS genome using gene prediction method GeneDecipher developed in our laboratory has been presented. Each of the 18 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes has been analyzed using GeneDecipher. In addition to polyprotein 1ab(1), polyprotein 1a and the four genes coding for major structural proteins spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), six to eight additional proteins have been predicted depending upon the strain analyzed. Their lengths range between 61 and 274 amino acids. Our method also suggests that polyprotein 1ab, polyprotein 1a, S, M and N are proteins of viral origin and others are of prokaryotic. Putative functions of all predicted protein-coding genes have been suggested using conserved peptides present in their open reading frames.

Replacing the reactive site of inhibitors with the consensus substrate recognition sequence of furin has been found to increase inhibitory activity greatly.

Using a discrete-time likelihood model, the authors estimated the transmission probability per contact for each day following the onset of symptoms. The results suggested that there may be two peaks in the probability of SARS transmission, the first occurring around day 2 after symptom onset and the second occurring approximately 10 days after symptom onset. Index patients who were aged 60 years or older or whose lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated upon admission to the hospital (indicating higher viral loads) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts. There was little variation in the daily transmission probabilities before versus after the introduction of public health interventions on or around March 26, 2003. This study suggests that the probability of transmission of SARS is dependent upon characteristics of the index patients and does not simply reflect temporal variability in the viral load of SARS cases.","publish_time":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pitzer, Virginia E.; Leung, Gabriel M.; Lipsitch, Marc","journal":"Am J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/304c5541efdc8374c98176e1e9e8f0999ef75baf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110150.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzIwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["probability of SARS transmission","probability of transmission","transmission probability","household contacts of SARS patients","date of symptom onset","viral load of SARS cases","Index patients","onset of symptoms","daily transmission probabilities","authors","date of hospitalization","contact tracing","higher viral loads","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","admission","years","Hong Kong","characteristics","lactate dehydrogenase level","extensive data collection","discrete-time likelihood model","little variation","temporal variability","China","introduction of public health interventions","peaks","days","study","results"],"language":"en"},

They are globally widespread, infecting a large variety of terrestrial animals, birds, insects and even fish. Moreover, they are capable of surviving and circulating in both sylvatic and urban environments, causing considerable human morbidity and mortality. The re-emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in almost every part of the world has caused alarm to many health agencies throughout the world. The mosquito vector for this virus, Aedes, is globally distributed in tropical and temperate regions and capable of thriving in both rural and urban landscapes, giving the opportunity for CHIKV to continue expanding into new geographical regions. Despite the importance of alphaviruses as human pathogens, there is currently no targeted antiviral treatment available for alphavirus infection. This mini-review discusses some of the major features in the replication cycle of alphaviruses, highlighting the key viral targets and host components that participate in alphavirus replication and the molecular functions that were used in drug design. Together with describing the importance of these targets, we review the various direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors, specifically small molecules that have been discovered and developed as potential therapeutics as well as their reported in vitro and in vivo efficacies.","publish_time":"2017-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ching, Kuan-Chieh; F.

The Escherichia coli-expressed M2e-FP-1 and M2e-FP-2 proteins induced similarly high-titer M2e-FP-specific antibodies in the immunized mice. Importantly, both proteins were able to prevent lethal challenge of heterologous H1N1 influenza virus, with significantly reduced viral titers and alleviated pathological changes in the lungs, as well as increased body weight and complete survivals, in the challenge mice. Taken together, our study demonstrates that highly conserved M2e and FP epitope of HA of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses can be used as important targets for development of safe and economical universal influenza vaccines, and that the position of H7N9 M2e and H5N1 HA epitope sequences in the vaccine components has no significant effects on the immunogenicity and efficacy of M2e-FP-based subunit vaccines.","publish_time":"2017-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Yan; He, Lei; Song, Nianping; Li, Pei; Sun, Shihui; Zhao, Guangyu; Tai, Wanbo; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110499.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzI5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conserved M2e","efficacy of M2e","high-titer M2e-FP","FP epitope of HA","position of H7N9 M2e","H7N9 influenza viruses","FP-based subunit vaccines","pathogenic influenza viruses","economical universal influenza vaccines","influenza virus infection","universal vaccines","H5N1 HA epitope sequences","lethal challenge of heterologous H1N1 influenza virus","epitope of hemagglutinin","recombinant protein vaccines","2H5M2e-2H7M2e","2H7M2e-H7FP","conserved sequences","2H5M2e-H5FP","H5FP-H7FP","challenge mice","proteins","study","development of safe","immunized mice","vaccine components","complete survivals","specific antibodies","viral titers","serious threat","lungs","public health","alleviated pathological changes","significant effects","important targets","molecules of ectodomain","immunogenicity","molecule of fusion peptide","increased body weight","pandemic potential","urgent need","different orders","Escherichia coli"],"language":"en"},

We examined this issue in patients with ARDS enrolled in the Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE (LUNG SAFE) study. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the LUNG SAFE study, we wished to determine the prevalence and the outcomes associated with hyperoxemia on day 1, sustained hyperoxemia, and excessive oxygen use in patients with early ARDS. Patients who fulfilled criteria of ARDS on day 1 and day 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were categorized based on the presence of hyperoxemia (PaO(2) \u003E 100 mmHg) on day 1, sustained (i.e., present on day 1 and day 2) hyperoxemia, or excessive oxygen use (FIO(2) \u2265 0.60 during hyperoxemia). RESULTS: Of 2005 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 131 (6.5%) were hypoxemic (PaO(2) \u003C 55 mmHg), 607 (30%) had hyperoxemia on day 1, and 250 (12%) had sustained hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use occurred in 400 (66%) out of 607 patients with hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use decreased from day 1 to day 2 of ARDS, with most hyperoxemic patients on day 2 receiving relatively low FIO(2). Multivariate analyses found no independent relationship between day 1 hyperoxemia, sustained hyperoxemia, or excess FIO(2) use and adverse clinical outcomes. Mortality was 42% in patients with excess FIO(2) use, compared to 39% in a propensity-matched sample of normoxemic (PaO(2) 55\u2013100 mmHg) patients (P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxemia and excess oxygen use are both prevalent in early ARDS but are most often non-sustained. No relationship was found between hyperoxemia or excessive oxygen use and patient outcome in this cohort.

The previous studies have provided different theoretical predictions of the epidemic threshold for the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, but the numerical verification of these theoretical predictions is still lacking. Considering that the large fluctuation of the outbreak size occurs near the epidemic threshold, we propose a novel numerical identification method of SIR epidemic threshold by analyzing the peak of the epidemic variability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that the variability measure can successfully give the numerical threshold for the SIR model. The heterogeneous mean-field prediction agrees very well with the numerical threshold, except the case that the networks are disassortative, in which the quenched mean-field prediction is relatively close to the numerical threshold. Moreover, the numerical method presented is also suitable for the susceptible-infected-susceptible model.

In particular, individuals can obtain different types of information about the disease and respond by altering their behaviors, and this can affect the spreading dynamics, possibly in a significant way. We propose a model where individuals\u0027 behavioral response is based on a generic type of local information, i.e., the number of neighbors that has been infected with the disease. Mathematically, the response can be characterized by a reduction in the transmission rate by a factor that depends on the number of infected neighbors. Utilizing the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-recovery dynamical models for epidemic spreading, we derive a theoretical formula for the epidemic threshold and provide numerical verification. Our analysis lays on a solid quantitative footing the intuition that individual behavioral response can in general suppress epidemic spreading. Furthermore, we find that the hub nodes play the role of \u201Cdouble-edged sword\u201D in that they can either suppress or promote outbreak, depending on their responses to the epidemic, providing additional support for the idea that these nodes are key to controlling epidemic spreading in complex networks.","publish_time":"2014-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hai-Feng; Xie, Jia-Rong; Tang, Ming; Lai, Ying-Cheng","journal":"Chaos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3606273f5aed219fc7040a2d5eaf282f868767c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic spreading","epidemic dynamics","epidemic threshold","spreading dynamics","standard susceptible-infected","number of infected neighbors","individual behavioral response","complex networks","individual behaviors","individuals\u0027 behavioral response","number of neighbors","disease","hub nodes","different types of information","generic type of local information","solid quantitative footing","recovery dynamical models","intuition","general","theoretical formula","analysis lays","role","idea","additional support","interplay","topic of recent","transmission rate","factor","reduction","responses","numerical verification","double-edged sword","significant way","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated. FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Diagnostic tests are commercially available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories. During FIV infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome. The incubation period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment of immune function develops. Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes. Later, the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis, enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin. Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a smaller proportion. The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a period of months to years. Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has been shown to accelarate the progression of disease. In vitro, phenotypic mixing between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus. Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation. As with the feline representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg(\u002B\u002B) preference; it replicates and induces syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro. Antigenic analyses have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of BIV and HIV. The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small ORFs were found. Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the env-encoding ORF. These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV displays extensive genomic variation. When random cattle sera from the Netherlands were tested by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or radio-immunoprecipitation, 0.7% appeared seropositive; thus BIV infection is not uncommon in one European cattle population.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Egberink, H.; Horzinek, M.C.","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117276/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV","BIV"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["Feline immunodeficiency virus","Bovine immunodeficiency virus","human immunodeficiency virus","FIV infection","BIV infection","feline leukaemia virus","single virus","lymphadenopathy","HIV","equine infectious anaemia virus","feline representative","FIV-infected cats","emaciation","vague signs of illness","predominant clinical signs","major core protein of BIV","endogenous feline oncovirus","Concomitant infection","long period of clinical normalcy","attempts","period of months","leucocytes of cattle","incubation period","syndrome","years","additional small ORFs","European cattle population","random cattle sera","antigenic relatedness","progressive weakness","secondary stage","Antigenic analyses","additional isolates","lentivirus morphology","original isolate","transient primary illness","env genes common","upper respiratory tract infections","variety of embryonic bovine tissues","biochemical characteristics similar","enteritis","gingivitis","chronic stomatitis","recurrent fevers","replication-competent retroviruses","central nervous system","lesions","lack of appetite","haematological disorder","conservation of epitopes","Netherlands","gag","pol","leucopenia","persistent lymphocytosis","Western blot","engineered vaccines","large open reading frames","indirect immunofluorescence","syncytia","subunit","time","extensive genomic variation","gradual impairment of immune function","behavioural changes","cause of AIDS","phenotypic mixing","Numerous point mutations","deletions","radio-immunoprecipitation","Neoplasias","cell spectrum","Diagnostic tests","RD114","different laboratories","smaller proportion","reverse transcriptase","broadening","neutropenia","skin","progression of disease","preference","data"],"language":"en"},

Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Wei; Duhamel, Gerald E.; Benfield, David A.; Grotelueschen, Dale M.","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","BRV","GPHS"],"locations":["Nebraska"],"keyphrases":["BRV strain BRV strain B223","BRV strain B641","strains NS","amplification of strain NS","G10 strain B223","reassortant BRV","BRV reassortant","BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln","strains B641","BRV infecting cattle","G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln","designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff","strains of bovine rotavirus","identical group","reference group","different gene segments","results","P gene different","vaccine virus","G10-specific neutralizing mAb","genomic RNA probes","G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody","GPHS","Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus","RNA electrophoretic patterns","virus neutralization assays","G-specific cDNA probe","neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches","commercial vaccine","Co-electrophoresis experiments","Nucleic acid hybridization experiments","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","guinea pig hyperimmune serum","P11","dams","hybridizations","diarrheal syndrome","existence","genotypic methods","P5","Nothern blot","study"],"language":"en"},

Genotype-inferred low metabolizers are found in 1\u20134% of African populations, which corresponds to millions of expected exposures to the drug. In vivo pharmacokinetic data on amodiaquine is limited. By combining it with published in vitro pharmacodynamic and drug metabolism information, we review and predict the possible relevance, or lack of, of CYP2C8 polymorphisms in the present and future efficacy of amodiaquine. Chloroquine and dapsone, both substrates of CYP2C8, are also discussed in the same context.","publish_time":"2007-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gil, JP; Gil Berglund, E","journal":"Pharmacogenomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/828a5040be0db615e283abce3494ca0727106905.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117598.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["future efficacy of amodiaquine","CYP2C8 polymorphisms","substrates of CYP2C8","main partner","main hope","drug metabolism information","major infectious disease","isoform 2C8","polymorphic cytochrome P450","lack","pharmacodynamic","millions of expected exposures","people","small children","efficacious artemisinine combination therapy","active desethylamodiaquine","dapsone","Malaria","Genotype","low metabolizers","possible relevance","Chloroquine","African populations","combinations","gene polymorphism","pharmacokinetic data","question","years","context"],"language":"en"},

However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, Rc. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean Rc between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for P. vivax cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a Rc value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p\u003E0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p\u003E0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020. However, even with a mean of 0.005 projected up to 2020, locally-acquired cases are possible due to high levels of importation.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Routledge, Isobel; Lai, Shengjie; Battle, Katherine E.; Ghani, Azra C.; Gomez-Rodriguez, Manuel; Gustafson, Kyle B.; Mishra, Swapnil; Unwin, Juliette; Proctor, Joshua L.; Tatem, Andrew J.; Li, Zhongjie; Bhatt, Samir","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b761a3d51d0465f08e7d4afb9d847df7226f73d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117777.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQ4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["malaria cases","number of cases","imported cases","vivax cases","falciparum cases","spatio-temporal transmission","malaria elimination","sustained local transmission","common metrics of malaria transmission","joint likelihood of transmission","geo-located individual-level dataset of cases","malaria incidence","Yunnan province","elimination contexts","mean Rc","spatio-temporal pattern","spatio-temporal geostatistical models","high levels of importation","high levels of case ascertainment","estimates","Rc value","case reproduction number","unobserved sources of infection","unobserved source of infection","current intervention efforts","latent diffusion process","changes","potential","parasite prevalence","novel Bayesian framework","timeline","major reductions","decline","space","track","China","order","progress","reporting","risk of resurgence","relationship","re-emergence"],"language":"en"},

As a result, the specificity of ProDect BCS RV CHIP is high, however, the sensitivity (25%) of the assay is not sufficient for routine laboratory use.","publish_time":"2007-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C7i\u00E7ek, Candan; G\u00FClen, Figen; Karata\u015F, Eylem; Demir, Esen; Tana\u00E7, Remziye; Bacako\u011Flu, Feza; Bilgi\u00E7, Alt\u0131nay","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ProDect BCS RV CHIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parainfluenza virus type","specificity of ProDect BCS RV CHIP","influenza virus type B","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza type B","diagnostic accuracy of ProDect BCS RV CHIP","shell vial cell culture assay","combination of shell vial cell culture","combination of immunofluorescent antibody test","chip hybridization assay","different viruses","detection of respiratory viruses","adenovirus","positive specimens","sensitivity","multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","gold standard","NPV","PPV","present study","alternative","routine laboratory use","result"],"language":"en"},

In multiple sclerosis (MS), however, as in endocrine autoimmune diseases, there is a marked increase of HLA expression in the tissue (i.e. the plaques) and this is attributable not only to infiltrating cells but also to the astrocytes. To gain an insight into the regulation of HLA in the different cell types in the CNS and to compare it to that observed in the endocrine organs, we have studied the effect of the lympho/monokines interferon (IFN)-\u03B1 and -\u03B3, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, and interleukin (IL)-2 and other agents on this aspect of the biology of human fetal brain cells in culture. A two-colour immunofluorescence technique which combines antibodies to diverse CNS cell markers and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to the non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules was used throughout this study. In control cultures, only astrocytes expressed MHC class I, but after incubation with either IFN-\u03B3 or TNF-\u03B1 oligodendrocytes acquired class I expression. Surprisingly, astrocytes became spontaneously class II positive in culture and this was greatly enhanced by IFN-\u03B3. Other agents such as IL-2, epidermal growth factor, phorbolmyristate acetate and lectins had no effect. The expression of HLA molecules in the cells of the CNS both in basal conditions and in response to lymphokines is therefore selective and highly heterogenous, thus reflecting their intrinsic biological diversity. These findings may help to explain the features of the immunopathology of MS and also of latent viral infections of neural cells.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mauerhoff, Thekla; Pujol-Borrell, Ricardo; Mirakian, Rita; Bottazzo, Gian Franco","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA","CNS","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of HLA molecules","regulation of HLA","IFN-\u03B3","astrocytes","marked increase of HLA expression","low levels of HLA molecules","non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules","diverse CNS cell markers","TNF-\u03B1 oligodendrocytes","MHC class","effect","IL","agents","biology of human fetal brain cells","latent viral infections of neural cells","monoclonal antibodies","immunopathology of MS","endocrine organs","epidermal growth factor","tumour necrosis factor","different cell types","endocrine autoimmune diseases","MoAbs","phorbolmyristate acetate","lymphokines","lectins","monokines interferon","basal conditions","central nervous system","response","aspect","two-colour immunofluorescence technique","peculiarity","tissue","incubation","control cultures","features","interleukin","intrinsic biological diversity","plaques","multiple sclerosis","insight","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Significant efforts have been made to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics; however, the interaction of NDV with the host is not yet fully understood. Interferons (IFNs), an integral component of innate immune signaling, act as the first line of defense against invading viruses. Compared with the mammalian repertoire of IFNs, limited information is available on the antiviral potential of IFNs in chickens. Here, we expressed chicken IFN-\u03B3 (chIFN-\u03B3) using a baculovirus expression vector system, characterized its antiviral potential against NDV, and determined its antiviral potential. Priming of chicken embryo fibroblasts with chIFN-\u03B3 elicited an antiviral environment in primary cells, which was mainly due to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A genome-wide transcriptomics approach was used to elucidate the possible signaling pathways associated with IFN-\u03B3-induced immune responses. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed significant induction of ISG-associated pathways, activated temporal expression of ISGs, antiviral mediators, and transcriptional regulators in a cascade of antiviral responses. Collectively, we found that IFN-\u03B3 significantly elicited an antiviral response against NDV infection. These data provide a foundation for chIFN-\u03B3-mediated antiviral responses and underpin functional annotation of these important chIFN-\u03B3-induced antiviral influencers.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xin; Arslan, Mehboob; Liu, Xingjian; Song, Haozhi; Du, Mengtan; Li, Yin\u00FC; Zhang, Zhifang","journal":"Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31ddc479740311f05ff903e54a6c650c903302e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral mediators","antiviral environment","antiviral influencers","antiviral potential of IFNs","cascade of antiviral responses","important chIFN-\u03B3","chicken IFN-\u03B3","interaction of NDV","NDV infection","immune responses","significant threat","Significant efforts","data","associated pathways","temporal expression of ISGs","significant induction of ISG","mammalian repertoire of IFNs","severe morbidity","RNA-sequencing","severe economic losses","chicken embryo fibroblasts","baculovirus expression vector system","integral component of innate immune","limited information","mortality","transcriptional regulators","functional annotation","line of defense","global poultry industry","Newcastle disease virus","primary cells","genome-wide transcriptomics approach","therapeutics","invading viruses","interferon-stimulated genes","foundation","chickens","novel vaccines","Interferons","host"],"language":"en"},

We report on the immunological response elicited by two recombinant versions of the glycoprotein S from the swine-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) expressed in transgenic plants. Arabidoposis plants were genetically transformed with cDNAs constructs encoding either the N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1\u2013750) or the full-length glycoprotein S of TGEV, responsible for the neutralizing antibody induction against the virus, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter. Genomic DNA and mRNA analyses of leaf extracts from transformed plants demonstrated the incorporation of the foreign cDNA into the arabidopsis genome, as well as their transcription. Expression of recombinant polypeptides were observed in most transgenic plants by ELISA using specific antibodies. Mice immunized with leaf extracts from transgenic plants developed antibodies that reacted specifically with TGEV in ELISA, immunoprecipitated the virus-induced protein, and neutralized the virus infectivity. From these results, we conclude that transgenic plants expressing glycoprotein S polypeptides may possibly be used as a source of recombinant antigen for vaccine production.","publish_time":"1998-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez, N.; Carrillo, C.; Salinas, J.; Parra, F.; Borca, M.

Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of 48 consecutive patients who had undergone HDC/ASCT with TBC (thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide) conditioning for PCNSL (27 patients), secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL) (8 patients), or relapsed disease with CNS involvement (13 patients) from July 2006 to December 2017. Of the 27 patients with PCNSL, 21 had undergone ASCT at first complete remission (CR1). Results The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 80.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.9-92.9) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2%-92.7%) among all patients.

On univariate analysis of the patients with PCNSL, ASCT in CR1 was the only variable statistically significant for outcome (P = .007 for PFS; P = .008 for OS). Among patients with SCNSL or CNS relapse, the 2-year PFS and OS rate were comparable at 75.9% (95% CI, 59.5%-96.8%) and 75.3% (95% CI, 58.6%-98.6%), respectively.

During the last decades several attempts to identify potent and effective antivirals were made. Only a few of these demonstrated improvement in clinical signs in animal studies and none of the trials in humans showed significant efficacy. Here we explore novel opportunities to identify more potent anti-rabies molecules. In particular important progress has been made on antivirals against other Mononegavirales (paramyxoviruses, filoviruses) which should be an impetus to test and optimize these molecules towards anti-rabies virus therapies. Effective rabies antivirals for therapeutic use need to be molecules that can be dosed into the cerebrospinal fluid and that rapidly and potently block ongoing virus replication and as such stop the further spread of the virus. Antivirals for prophylactic use can also be envisaged and these should be able to prevent infection of peripheral nerve cells and should have the potential to replace the current anti-rabies immunoglobulins that are used in PEP.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jochmans, Dirk; Neyts, Johan","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b6887faa9aa0a480276cccb7423455cdffd1cd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172090.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17318121; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279280/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17318121","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Effective rabies antivirals","effective antivirals","potent anti-rabies molecules","anti-rabies virus therapies","current anti-rabies immunoglobulins","PEP","ongoing virus replication","therapeutic use","prophylactic use","important burden of disease","particular important progress","animal studies","trials","case-fatality ratio","neurological symptoms","clinical signs","potential","demonstrated improvement","infection of peripheral nerve cells","attempts","novel opportunities","Post-exposure prophylaxis","filoviruses","children","societal cost","humans","significant efficacy","patients","Mononegavirales","paramyxoviruses","year","decades","impetus","cerebrospinal fluid","spread"],"language":"en"},

This paper gives a prospective outlook on how the disruption caused by COVID-19 can act as a catalyst for short-term and long-term changes in plastic waste management practices throughout the world. The impact of the pandemic and epidemic following through the life cycles of various plastic products, particularly those needed for personal protection and healthcare, is assessed. The energy and environmental footprints of these product systems have increased rapidly in response to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, while critical hazardous waste management issues are emerging due to the need to ensure destruction of residual pathogens in household and medical waste. The concept of Plastic Waste Footprint (PWF) is proposed to capture the environmental footprint of a plastic product throughout its entire life cycle. Emerging challenges in waste management during and after the pandemic are discussed from the perspective of novel research and environmental policies. The sudden shift in waste composition and quantity highlights the need for a dynamically reponsive waste management system. Six future research directions are suggested to mitigate the potential impacts of the pandemic on waste management systems.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kleme\u0161, Ji\u0159\u00ED Jarom\u00EDr; Van Fan, Yee; Tan, Raymond R.; Jiang, Peng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4839cacc438af488bc10aaa59f44d992379c5afc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120301763?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364032120301763","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Plastic Waste Footprint"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["waste management systems","follow-up waste","waste composition","plastic waste management practices","medical waste","concept of Plastic Waste Footprint","reponsive waste management system","pandemic","critical hazardous waste management issues","plastic use","environmental consequences","environmental policies","environmental footprints","need","life cycles of various plastic products","product systems","potential impacts","number of COVID","Emerging challenges","urgent health issues","entire life cycle","perspective of novel research","future research directions","long-term changes","epidemic following","destruction of residual pathogens","household","quantity","cases","response","sudden shift","PWF","world","prospective outlook","catalyst","disruption","surge","energy","personal protection","healthcare","paper"],"language":"en"},

We sought to determine and elaborate on the microbiologic yield of BAL in SCT recipients, assess a correlation between BAL studies and less invasive means of pathogen detection, and assess the utility of repeating a BAL within 30 days. METHODS: Between January 1, 2009, and July 31, 2013, we reviewed medical records of 125 SCT recipients who underwent 179 BALs.

Assessment of the politics, production, financing, and economics of this international effort has suggested six lessons that might be pertinent to the pursuit of other global health goals. First, such goals should be based on technically sound strategies with proven operational feasibility in a large geographical area. Second, before launching an initiative, an informed collective decision must be negotiated and agreed in an appropriate international forum to keep to a minimum long-term risks in financing and implementation. Third, if substantial community engagement is envisaged, efficient deployment of sufficient resources at that level necessitates a defined, time-limited input by the community within a properly managed partnership. Fourth, although the so-called fair-share concept is arguably the best way to finance such goals, its limitations must be recognised early and alternative strategies developed for settings where it does not work. Fifth, international health goals must be designed and pursued within existing health systems if they are to secure and sustain broad support. Finally, countries, regions, or populations most likely to delay the achievement of a global health goal should be identified at the outset to ensure provision of sufficient resources and attention. The greatest threats to poliomyelitis eradication are a financing gap of US$210 million and difficulties in strategy implementation in at most five countries.","publish_time":"2003-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aylward, R Bruce; Acharya, Arnab; England, Sarah; Agocs, Mary; Linkins, Jennifer","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c55abb5f141dd742253a1682cf2e5e5c05a31bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112422.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603143371; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603143371","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health goals","international health goals","Global Polio Eradication Initiative","international effort","existing health systems","countries","financing gap of US","provision of sufficient resources","appropriate international forum","poliomyelitis eradication","efficient deployment of sufficient resources","sound strategies","strategy implementation","alternative strategies","substantial community engagement","proven operational feasibility","level","minimum long-term risks","achievement","large geographical area","time-limited input","concept","populations","difficulties","production","outset","economics","Summary","pursuit","greatest threats","regions","informed collective decision","lessons","politics","best way","attention","so-called fair","Assessment","settings","managed partnership","limitations","broad support"],"language":"en"},

An extension of previous efforts in FERC Order 679 issued in 2006, the NOPR-proposed incentives would consist of up to 250 additional basis points of equity return to be allowed on qualifying transmission projects. The NOPR was published in the Federal Register on April 2, and public comments were due back to FERC by July 1. Such incentives, if adopted, would be helpful to address prior FERC business that is yet undone. Issued in 2011, FERC Order 1000, \u201CTransmission and Cost Allocation by Transmission Owning and Operating Utilities\u201D among other things envisioned coordinated planning of interregional transmission developments spanning between individual Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) and Independent System Operators (ISO), the operators of the FERC-regulated organized wholesale markets. In addition to traditional goals of generator interconnection and service reliability, the purpose of such interregional transmission development was to support public policy goals including renewable energy development, and lower costs for consumers. But little or no such interregional development has happened since Order 1000. Why? The authors have spent the last several years promoting development of one such interregional transmission project. While the effort is ongoing, the on-the-ground experience to-date clearly shows the reasons why interregional development envisioned by FERC Order 1000 is not happening. The authors offer solutions to the issues, including how the new FERC NOPR for transmission incentives can be helpful.","publish_time":"2020-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schulte, Robert H.; Fletcher, Fredric C.","journal":"The Electricity Journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1040619020300658; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619020300658","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FERC","NOPR","Regional Transmission Organizations"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["transmission incentives","FERC Order","interregional development","interregional transmission project","new FERC NOPR","voltage electric transmission","qualifying transmission projects","prior FERC business","FERC Docket RM20","development of high","coordinated planning of interregional transmission developments","NOPR-proposed incentives","individual Regional Transmission Organizations","renewable energy development","financial incentives","authors","public policy goals","public comments","Federal Energy Regulatory Commission","Federal Register","Independent System Operators","Notice of Proposed Rulemaking","traditional goals of generator interconnection","RTO","service reliability","things","purpose","Operating Utilities","lower costs","Cost Allocation","ISO","date","United States","issues","extension of previous efforts","reasons","additional basis points of equity","organized wholesale markets","consumers","years","ground experience","solutions"],"language":"en"},

To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the associative capacity of the host\u2013virus networks in rodents and bats with the identification of those viruses with zoonotic potential. A virus database, detected by molecular methods, was constructed in the two taxonomic groups. We compiled 5,484 records: 825 in rodents and 4,659 in bats. We identified a total of 173 and 166 viruses, of which 53 and 40 are zoonotic viruses, in rodents and bats, respectively. Based on a network theory, a non\u2010directed bipartite host\u2013virus network was built for each group. Subsequently, the networks were collapsed to represent the connections among hosts and viruses. We identified both discrete and connected communities. We observed a greater degree of connectivity in bat viruses and more discrete communities in rodents. The Coronaviridae recorded in bats have the highest values of degree, betweenness and closeness centralities. In rodents, higher degree positions were distributed homogeneously between viruses and hosts. At least in our database, a higher proportion of rodent viruses were zoonotic. Rodents should thus not be underestimated as important reservoirs of zoonotic disease. We found that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than in rodents. Network theory can reveal some macroecological patterns and identify risks that were previously unrecognized. For example, we found that parvovirus in megabats and Gbagroube virus in rodents may represent a zoonotic risk due to the proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses. We propose that epidemiological surveillance programmes should consider the connectivity of network actors as a measure of the risks of dispersion and transmission.","publish_time":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieto\u2010Rabiela, Fabiola; Wiratsudakul, Anuwat; Suz\u00E1n, Gerardo; Rico\u2010Ch\u00E1vez, Oscar","journal":"Zoonoses Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcaf0538f6638f5e1c4a4aafb06751ac5dc653ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165641.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219223/; https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rodents","zoonotic viruses","bat viruses","great diversity of viruses","higher proportion of rodent viruses","virus networks","zoonotic risk","zoonotic potential","host networks","virus database","network theory","Gbagroube virus","important reservoirs of zoonotic disease","connectivity of network actors","greater degree of connectivity","higher degree positions","viral diversity","discrete communities","connected communities","hosts","non\u2010directed bipartite host","highest values of degree","important viral zoonoses","risks of dispersion","betweenness","measure","proximity","identification","associative capacity","parvovirus","macroecological patterns","megabats","humans","closeness centralities","epidemiological surveillance programmes","knowledge","molecular methods","connections","transmission","Coronaviridae","taxonomic groups","gap","example","records","total"],"language":"en"},

The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called \u2018phylogeny\u2019.

The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were the independent risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This finding would facilitate the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jun; Yu, Miao; Tong, Song; Liu, Lu-Yu; Tang, Liang-V.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d61918323e2deda8cc35e567e6acc9cd1d65ce65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187844.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104392; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361327/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301347?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Union Hospital"],"keyphrases":["deteriorated patients","discharged patients","poor outcomes of patients","vs","clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients","pg","deteriorated group","discharged group","predictive factors","early identification of high-risk COVID","laboratory","elevated CRP","IL","independent risk factors","poor prognosis","treatment data","gathered data","retrospective study","STUDY DESIGN","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","male gender","serum C","reactive protein","single-center","finding","studies","numbers of pulmonary lobe","lymphocyte count","Union Hospital","concentrations","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","comorbidity","lymphopenia"],"language":"en"},

Pneumonia results from the proliferation of microorganisms at these sites in combination with the host response to the presence of microorganisms. A variety of pneumonia syndromes can be defined based on microbial etiology, underlying host defenses, clinical presentation, and site of acquisition. Because of the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms, the diagnosis of pneumonia rests disproportionately on the presence of an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The frequent lack of a microbiologic diagnosis and the non-specificity of signs, symptoms, and radiographic infiltrates leads to frequent consideration of pneumonia in the differential diagnosis of many other pulmonary diseases. The etiologic spectrum of all types of pneumonia always includes the common community-acquired pathogens, with the spectrum broadening in response to either increasing immunocompromise or greater exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. While new or previously unrecognized pathogens can play a role in management decisions, the major issue in pneumonia is the appearance of antibiotic resistant strains of known common bacterial pathogens. Lack of even minimally effective agents is more the issue for nonbacterial pneumonias. Immunomodulation, in the form of less immunosuppressive cancer and transplant chemotherapy, immunization, or specific immunomodulatory drugs holds some hope for improving pneumonia outcome in the future.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wunderink, R.

METHODS: This article summarises the development process by reviewing key literature from CPG developers. It focuseson key methods and challenges specific to CPGs for integration by using text mining and bioinformatics to provide a powerful adjunct to CPG development. RESULTS: The guideline development process identified, together with new approaches, incorporates evidence-based methodology and provides better decisions through analysis of uncertain herb-drug interaction. CONCLUSIONS: This new process used three basic phases (preparation, development, and finalization) and seven steps providing a set of methodological principles for CPG development intergrating Chinese medicine and biomedicine.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Nannan; Zhong, Linda L.D.; Zhang, Chi; Han, Xuejie; Wang, Yuexi; Liu, Yuqi; Wang, Liying; Liu, Mengyu; Lu, Aiping","journal":"Eur J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bf7d5fc9581b3313f7a3e45f86332fe42c02c16.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6ee0ef48ef70f065fa1b4e6929615da57fc2275f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102766.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382016304139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288885/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2016.11.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382016304139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["guideline development process","comprehensive development process","new process","CPG development intergrating Chinese medicine","CPG developers","integration of Chinese medicine","biomedicine","clinical practice guidelines","focuseson key methods","analysis of uncertain herb-drug interaction","key literature","new approaches","CPGs","better decisions","set of methodological principles","biggest challenge","challenges specific","evidence-based methodology","rational use of predictions","bioinformatics","preparation","basic phases","text mining","powerful adjunct","steps","valid method","finalization","article","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The recent nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals in Seoul, Korea and at the National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia indicate the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV. Currently there are no effective anti-MERS-CoV anti-viral agents or therapeutics and MERS is associated with a high mortality rate (40%) in hospitalised patients. A large proportion of MERS patients who die have a range of pulmonary pathology ranging from pneumonia to adult respiratory distress syndrome with multi-organ failure, compounded by co-morbidities, reflecting a precarious balance of interactions between the host-immune system and MERS-CoV. Whilst we wait for new MERS-CoV specific drugs, therapeutics and vaccines to be developed, there is a need to advance a range of Host-Directed Therapies. A range of HDTs are available, including commonly used drugs with good safety profiles, which could augment host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to MERS-CoV, modulate excessive inflammation and reduce lung tissue destruction. We discuss the rationale and potential of using Host-Directed Therapies for improving the poor treatment outcomes associated with MERS. Carefully designed randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine whether HDTs could benefit patients with MERS. The recurrent outbreaks of MERS-CoV infections at hospitals in the Middle East present unique opportunities to conduct randomized clinical trials. The time has come for a more coordinated global response to MERS and a multidisciplinary global MERS-CoV response group is required to take forward priority research agendas.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zumla, Alimuddin; Azhar, Esam I.; Arabi, Yaseen; Alotaibi, Badriah; Rao, Martin; McCloskey, Brian; Petersen, Eskild; Maeurer, Markus","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42adec567c2bbd9a494edf3a3c1dc9455b33084a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26365771/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2015.09.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971215002155; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971215002155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Guard Hospital","MERS","Host-Directed Therapies"],"locations":["Jeddah Saudi Arabia","Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["cases of MERS","epidemic potential of MERS","recurrent outbreaks of MERS","new MERS-CoV specific drugs","multidisciplinary global MERS-CoV response group","large proportion of MERS patients","CoV infections","effective anti-MERS-CoV anti-viral agents","range of Host","range of HDTs","host-immune system","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","hospitals","therapeutics","coordinated global response","Therapies","hospitalised patients","Middle East present unique opportunities","Jeddah Saudi Arabia","global health security","randomized clinical trials","range of pulmonary pathology","randomized controlled trials","adult respiratory distress syndrome","used drugs","adaptive immune mechanisms","recent nosocomial outbreaks","multi-organ failure","pneumonia","novel zoonotic pathogen of humans","National Guard Hospital","Seoul","Korea","Riyadh","excessive inflammation","co-morbidities","discovery","precarious balance of interactions","good safety profiles","major threat","lung tissue destruction","poor treatment outcomes","vaccines","years","high mortality rate","Sporadic community","priority research agendas","Summary","rationale","need","time"],"language":"en"},

However the prevalence and pathogenicity of these parasites in the canine population still remained poorly resolved. Therefore the aim of the present study was (1) to determine the prevalence of trichomonads infecting puppies living in French breeding kennels, (2) to confirm the predominance of P. hominis in dogs, (3) to investigate the genetic diversity of P. hominis isolates identified in the French canine population and (4) to evaluate the risk factors for infection by P. hominis and the influence of the parasite on feces consistency. A total of 215 both diarrheic and non-diarrheic puppies from 25 French breeding kennels were included in this epidemiological survey. Fecal samples from each puppy were examined for 6 gastrointestinal pathogens: parvovirus type 2 (CPV2), coronavirus, Toxocara canis, Cystoisospora ohioensis-complex, Cystoisospora canis, and Giardia intestinalis. A part of each collected stool was also tested for the presence of motile trichomonads by microscopy after culturing. The prevalence of trichomonad infection was 15.8% (34/215) among puppies and 20% (5/25) among breeding kennels. DNA from 26 of the 34 positive samples was successfully amplified using a trichomonad-specific primer pair. Analysis of the sequences of PCR products indicated that P. hominis was the only trichomonad infecting the canine population. All the puppies infected with P. hominis belonged to large breed dogs. Moreover, puppies from large breeding kennels, excreting a high level of G. intestinalis and/or excreting a high level of C. canis oocysts showed a higher probability of being positive for P. hominis infection. Univariate analysis also revealed an increased risk for P. hominis infection in puppies with abnormal feces. However, in a multivariate analysis, CPV2 was the only gastrointestinal pathogen associated with abnormal feces. Since enteropathogens were commonly found in dogs infected by P. hominis, the pathogenic potential of this trichomonad species remained uncertain and has to be further evaluated by experimental infection studies.","publish_time":"2013-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grellet, Aur\u00E9lien; BrunoPolack,; Feugier, Alexandre; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Grandjean, Dominique; Vandewynckel, Laurine; Cian, Amandine; Meloni, Dionigia; Viscogliosi, Eric","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fae4be955c26b2771a6eb3ab5405ffdbbc2186b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116904.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.07.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401713004354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993636/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401713004354","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P. hominis","Toxocara"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hominis infection","hominis isolates","Pentatrichomonas hominis","prevalence of trichomonad infection","feces of dogs","French breeding kennels","large breeding kennels","prevalence of trichomonads infecting puppies","non-diarrheic puppies","abnormal feces","French canine population","Cystoisospora canis","feces consistency","experimental infection studies","large breed dogs","trichomonad species Tritrichomonas fetus","Toxocara canis","canis oocysts","CPV2","high level of","trichomonad-specific primer pair","Univariate analysis","multivariate analysis","positive samples","gastrointestinal pathogens","increased risk","risk factors","Giardia intestinalis","Fecal samples","Cystoisospora ohioensis-complex","presence of motile trichomonads","coronavirus","influence","parvovirus type","higher probability","pathogenic potential","microscopy","puppy","parasites","sequences of PCR products","culturing","genetic diversity of","pathogenicity","epidemiological survey","aim","present study","total","diarrhea","predominance of","collected stool","DNA"],"language":"en"},

Robust national emergency preparedness is vital to mitigate the transmission of infectious diseases agents domestically and to prevent onward spread to other countries. Given the complex range of stakeholders who respond to an infectious disease threat being transmitted through air travel, it is important that protocols be tested and practised extensively in advance of a real emergency. Simulation exercises include the identification of possible scenarios based on the probability of hazards and the vulnerability of populations as a basis for planning, and provide a useful measure of preparedness efforts and capabilities. In October 2016, a live simulation exercise was conducted at a major airport in Ireland incorporating a public health threat for the first time, with the notification of a possible case of MERS-CoV aboard an aircraft plus an undercarriage fire. Strengths of the response to the communicable disease threat included appropriate public health risk assessment, case management, passenger information gathering, notification to relevant parties, and communication to passengers and multiple agencies. Lessons learned include: o Exercise planning should not be overly ambitious. In testing too many facets of emergency response, the public health response could be deprioritised. o The practical implementation of communication protocols in a real-time exercise of this scope proved challenging. These protocols should continue to be checked and tested by desk-top exercises to ensure that all staff concerned are familiar with them, especially in the context of staff turn-over. o The roles and responsibilities of the various agencies must be clear to avoid role confusion. o Equipment and infrastructure capacities must be considered and in place in advance of an actual incident or test, for example whether or not cell phone signals require boosting during a major event. Importantly, exercises bring together individuals representing organisations with different roles and perspectives allowing identification of capabilities and limitations, and problem solving about how to address the gaps and overlaps in a low-threat collaborative setting.","publish_time":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Greg; Boland, Mairin","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c09a602a62f8976f5772470145fd98f2abfa1236.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5842601.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-018-0323-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514664/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ireland"],"keyphrases":["public health threat","public health response","infectious disease threat","o Exercise planning","o Equipment","Simulation exercises","communicable disease threat","facets of emergency response","notification","real-time exercise","transmission of infectious diseases agents","identification of capabilities","real emergency","live simulation exercise","advance","appropriate public health risk assessment","low-threat collaborative setting","Robust national emergency preparedness","practical implementation of communication protocols","international air travel","possible case of MERS","identification of possible scenarios","case management","different roles","onward spread","major airport","various agencies","multiple agencies","major event","context of staff","scope of human mobility","rapid spread of novel","mutated zoonotic agents","useful measure of preparedness efforts","passenger information","potential","perspectives","relevant parties","global transport network","example","actual incident","pathogens","CoV","passengers","organisations","Ireland","non-endemic areas","vulnerability of populations","probability of hazards","place","ever-increasing speed","overlaps","limitations","individuals","responsibilities","phone signals","infrastructure capacities","aircraft","basis","testing","Lessons","complex range of stakeholders","role confusion","undercarriage","gaps","problem","countries","Strengths","desk"],"language":"en"},

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2019-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2019-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2019-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.","publish_time":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paraskevis, D.; Kostaki, E.G.; Magiorkinis, G.; Panayiotakopoulos, G.; Tsiodras, S.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.26.920249","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV","coronavirus sequences","novel coronavirus","BatCoV RaTG13 sequence","discordant phylogenetic clustering","phylogenetic analysis","human transmission","Bat-SARS","discordant clustering","sequence similarity","genome","Methods Putative recombination","humans","half","severe human infection","levels of genetic similarity","genomic features","Bayesian methods","distinct lineage","sarbecovirus branch","subgenus of sarbecovirus","genetic relationships","individual genomic fragments","separate distant lineage","virulence","potential association","virus characteristics","RDP4","maximum likelihood","Simplot v3","single cluster","outbreak","ORF1b","spike regions","end of ORF1a","middle region","Conclusions","hypothesis","exact variant","city of Wuhan","China","objectives","betacoronavirus","attention","bats","evidence","mosaic","positions","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barriers to infect humans. Bats, which harbour a diverse pool of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), are believed to be the natural reservoir. The SARS-CoV surface Spike (S) protein is a major antigenic determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibody production during SARS-CoV infection. In our previous work, we showed that a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the S2 subunit of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Lip KM et al, J Virol. 2006 Jan; 80(2): 941\u201350). In this study, we report our findings on the characterization of one of these mAbs, known as 1A9, which binds to the S protein at a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111\u20131130. MAb 1A9 is a broadly neutralizing mAb that prevents viral entry mediated by the S proteins of human and civet SARS-CoVs as well as bat SL-CoVs. By generating mutant SARS-CoV that escapes the neutralization by mAb 1A9, the residue D1128 in S was found to be crucial for its interaction with mAb 1A9. S protein containing the substitution of D1128 with alanine (D1128A) exhibited a significant decrease in binding capability to mAb 1A9 compared to wild-type S protein. By using a pseudotyped viral entry assay, it was shown that the D1128A substitution in the escape virus allows it to overcome the viral entry blockage by mAb 1A9. In addition, the D1128A mutation was found to exert no effects on the S protein cell surface expression and incorporation into virion particles, suggesting that the escape virus retains the same viral entry property as the wild-type virus.","publish_time":"2014-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Oi-Wing; Keng, Choong-Tat; Leung, Cynthia Sau-Wai; Peiris, J.

Using MIC, all but one isolate was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested; the non-susceptible isolate was resistant to tetracycline, but this MIC result could not be compared to disc diffusion, since there are no interpretative guidelines for disc diffusion for H. somni against tetracycline. In this study, there was little evidence of antimicrobial resistance in H. somni isolates from Australian cattle. Disc diffusion susceptibility testing results were comparable to MIC results for most antimicrobial agents tested; however, results for isolates with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to tilmicosin and tulathromycin on disc diffusion should be interpreted with caution in the absence of MIC results.","publish_time":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldspink, Lauren K.; Mollinger, Joanne L.; Barnes, Tamsin S.; Groves, Mitchell; Mahony, Timothy J.; Gibson, Justine S.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d140851a3ec21d0db6b15b2c280af7b87fc478c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110471.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023314005048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023314005048; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.12.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIC"],"locations":["Queensland","New South Wales","Australia"],"keyphrases":["somni isolates","antimicrobial agents","Disc diffusion susceptibility testing results","antimicrobial susceptibility testing","basis of disc diffusion","antimicrobial resistance traits","tilmicosin","absence of MIC results","little evidence of antimicrobial resistance","tulathromycin","intermediate susceptibility","tetracycline","clonal relationships","non-susceptible isolate","epidemiology of Histophilus somni","Australian cattle","study","Australian state","repetitive sequence PCR","minimum inhibitory concentration","florfenicol","ceftiofur","enrofloxacin","descriptive epidemiological analysis","New South Wales","Queensland","caution","assays","interpretative guidelines","cluster"],"language":"en"},

Here, the crystal structure of SARS\u2010CoV PL(pro) C112S mutant in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) is reported at 1.4 \u00C5 resolution. The Ub core makes mostly hydrophilic interactions with PL(pro), while the Leu\u2010Arg\u2010Gly\u2010Gly C\u2010terminus of Ub is located in the catalytic cleft of PL(pro), mimicking the P4\u2013P1 residues and providing the first atomic insights into its catalysis. One of the O atoms of the C\u2010terminal Gly residue of Ub is located in the oxyanion hole consisting of the main\u2010chain amides of residues 112 and 113. Mutations of residues in the PL(pro)\u2013Ub interface lead to reduced catalytic activity, confirming their importance for Ub binding and/or catalysis. The structure also revealed an N\u2010cyclohexyl\u20102\u2010aminethanesulfonic acid molecule near the catalytic triad, and kinetic studies suggest that this binding site is also used by other PL(pro) inhibitors.

Examples are emerging infections such as HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, deliberate release of microorganisms, such as the anthrax episode in the USA, the increasing problems with organisms resistant to antimicrobial treatment, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the threat of a new influenza pandemic with a case fatality rate similar to that in the 1918 outbreak. An effective response to infectious disease emergencies requires careful planning and establishment of resources in advance. The medical specialties involved are clinical microbiology, clinical infectious diseases and epidemiology. Clinical microbiology should include bacteriology, virology and parasitology; the technical developments during the last 15 years have clearly erased most of the methodological differences between these branches of microbiology. New techniques such as new generations of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), rapid methods for nucleic acid sequence analyses and microarrays have enabled more rapid identification of organisms and provide powerful tools in the epidemiological analysis of an outbreak. The infectious disease specialists are necessary for rapid and adequate clinical diagnoses, optimal use of antimicrobial agents and provision of facilities for containment of patients who may spread the infections. The need for isolation units became acute when many countries prepared themselves for a possible severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Europe. With few exceptions, Europe still lacks epidemiological field forces, and it has been embarrassing to be obliged to call upon the Centers for Disease Control for European outbreaks. Hopefully, this will be corrected with the creation of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ragnar Norrby, S.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c37c63d58f5106920f6841e8e043ab00f11ccfe4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128912.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15300161; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15300161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["clinical microbiology","Disease Control","infectious disease emergencies","clinical infectious diseases","infectious disease specialists","Disease Prevention","possible severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak","rapid methods","adequate clinical diagnoses","rapid identification of organisms","organisms resistant","New techniques","branches of microbiology","emerging infections","importance of infections","new influenza pandemic","antimicrobial treatment","European Centre","European outbreaks","epidemiological analysis","new generations of Polymerase Chain Reaction","epidemiological field forces","optimal use of antimicrobial agents","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","PCR","careful planning","HIV","AIDS","nucleic acid sequence analyses","provision of facilities","microarrays","threat","increasing problems","virology","deliberate release of microorganisms","case fatality rate similar","powerful tools","establishment of resources","USA","countries","effective response","technical developments","parasitology","containment of patients","public health","isolation units","bacteriology","Centers","epidemiology","anthrax episode","medical specialties","advance","methodological differences","need","Examples","exceptions","creation","ECDC","years"],"language":"en"},

A list of 13 topics/sub-topics, as well as a list of 25 specific zoonotic diseases/agents emerged from the first phase of the survey. In the second phase the expert panel identified general knowledge of the clinical aspects and epidemiological aspects of zoonoses, as well as risk management practices, as the most important KAPs and research priorities for both GPs and veterinarians. In terms of diseases, the expert panel regarded knowledge of Hendra virus, Q fever, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), anthrax and Brucella suis most important for veterinarians, whilst for GPs, Q fever, gastrointestinal/foodborne diseases, influenza, ABLV and local vector-borne diseases were found to be most important by the expert panel.

Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery1. Whether this virus-induced ER remodelling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6 (encoding IFN-\u03B1-inducible protein 6), an IFN-stimulated gene cloned over 30 years ago2, and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ER-localized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae family member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outwards from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments that are required for replication.","publish_time":"2018-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richardson, R.

There is still no effective method to prevent or treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by SARS coronavirus (CoV). In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of a fully human monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV in vitro in a Rhesus macaque model of SARS. Methods. The antibody 5H10 was obtained by vaccination of KM mice bearing human immunoglobulin genes with Escherichiacoli\u2013producing recombinant peptide containing the dominant epitope of the viral spike protein found in convalescent serum samples from patients with SARS. Results. 5H10, which recognized the same epitope that is also a cleavage site critical for the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells, inhibited propagation of the virus and pathological changes found in Rhesus macaques infected with the virus through the nasal route. In addition, we analyzed the mode of action of 5H10, and the results suggested that 5H10 inhibited fusion between the virus envelope and host cell membrane. 5H10 has potential for use in prevention and treatment of SARS if it reemerges.

Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient\u0027s age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.","publish_time":"2011-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruuskanen, Olli; Lahti, Elina; Jennings, Lance C; Murdoch, David R","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1c95fc0ea9e1ab3de0a2adde0097bc7ba70c005.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138033.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61459-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cause of pneumonia","incidence of viral pneumonia","bacterial pneumonia","cases of viral community","obvious viral community","evidence of viral","role of viruses","cases of community","pathogenesis of community","particular influenza viruses","Presence of viral epidemics","Dual viral infections","parainfluenza viruses","children","adults","clear role","Influenza vaccines","predominant role","developing countries","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","clear consensus","use of specific antivirals","bacterial co-infection","putative causative agents","available specific preventive measures","biomarkers","symptoms","illness","speed of onset","patient\u0027s age","respiratory syncytial virus","radiographic changes","response","treatment","understanding","rhinoviruses","patients","findings","neuraminidase inhibitors","data","coronaviruses","regional differences","year","Molecular diagnostic tests","clinical algorithm","antibiotics","studies"],"language":"en"},

And the patterns of synonymous codon usage are quite different in HAV genomes from different location. The base composition is closely correlated with codon usage bias. Furthermore, the most important determinant that results in such a high codon bias in HAV is mutation pressure rather than natural selection. CONCLUSIONS: HAV presents a higher codon usage bias than other members of Picornaviridae. Compositional constraint is a significant element that influences the variation of synonymous codon usage in HAV genome. Besides, mutation pressure is supposed to be the major factor shaping the hyperendemic codon usage pattern of HAV.","publish_time":"2011-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yiqiang; Liu, Yongsheng; Liu, Wenqian; Zhou, Jianhua; Chen, Haotai; Wang, Yin; Ma, Lina; Ding, Yaozhong; Zhang, Jie","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/438e817dea190348df99e09a8e519fc64101b899.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3087699.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21496278/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV","Picornaviridae"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hyperendemic codon usage pattern of HAV","higher codon usage bias","synonymous codon usage pattern of HAV genome","variation of synonymous codon usage","patterns of synonymous codon usage","high codon bias","overall extent of codon usage bias","HAV genomes","key genetic determinants of codon usage","viral hepatitis","mutation pressure","RESULTS","occasional acute hepatitis","different location","members of Picornaviridae","causative agent","process","major factor","little information","significant element","virus","Compositional constraint","study","evolution","CONCLUSIONS","base composition","BACKGROUND","important determinant"],"language":"en"},

Objective We sought to prospectively assess airflow limitation and airway inflammation in children 4 to 6 years old with episodic virus-induced wheeze. Methods Ninety-three children 4 to 6 years old with a history of mild, virus-induced episodes of wheeze who were able to perform acceptable fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) maneuvers and spirometry (with forced expiratory time \u22650.5 seconds) were followed prospectively. Lung function and Feno values were measured every 6 weeks (baseline) within the first 48 hours of an acute wheezing episode (day 0) and 10 and 30 days later. Symptom scores and peak flow measurement were recorded daily. Results Forty-three children experienced a wheezing episode. At day 0, Feno values were significantly increased, whereas forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (FEV0.5) significantly decreased compared with baseline (16 ppb [interquartile range {IQR}, 13-20 ppb] vs 9 ppb IQR, 7-11 ppb] and 0.84 L [IQR, 0.75-0.99 L] vs 0.99 L [IQR, 0.9-1.07 L], respectively; both P \u003C .001). Airflow limitation at day 0 was reversible after bronchodilation. FEV0.5 and Feno values were significantly associated with each other and with lower and upper respiratory tract symptoms when assessed longitudinally but not cross-sectionally at all time points independently of atopy. Feno and FEV0.5 values returned to baseline levels within 10 days. Conclusions Mild episodes of wheeze in preschoolers are characterized by enhanced airway inflammation, reversible airflow limitation, and asthma-related symptoms. Feno values increase significantly during the first 48 hours and return to personal baseline within 10 days from the initiation of the episode. Longitudinal follow-up suggests that symptoms, inflammation, and lung function correlate well in this phenotype of asthma.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konstantinou, George N.; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Manousakis, Emmanuel; Makrinioti, Heidi; Kouloufakou-Gratsia, Kalliopi; Saxoni-Papageorgiou, Photini; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dd00e91d390920a61a08b760011d3a30c9da921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112251.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674912017010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674912017010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23199600/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.10.033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Feno values","ppb IQR","FEV0","days","virus-induced episodes of wheeze","reversible airflow limitation","recurrent episodes of wheeze","Conclusions Mild episodes of wheeze","phenotype of asthma","personal baseline","baseline levels","asthma-related symptoms","episodic virus-induced wheeze","enhanced airway inflammation","years old","preschool-aged children","distinct asthma phenotype","Lung function","forced expiratory time","acute wheezing episode","seconds","hours","vs","history of mild","upper respiratory tract symptoms","expiratory volume","time points","maneuvers","preschoolers","acceptable fraction of exhaled nitric oxide","spirometry","Symptom scores","peak flow measurement","interquartile range","Longitudinal follow-up","Results","initiation","weeks","atopy","Background","bronchodilation","Methods","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Despite advances in vaccine and antiviral drug technology, each year over three million people die from a range of viral infections. Predominant viruses include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis viruses, and gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. Now more than ever, robust, easily mobilised and cost-effective antiviral strategies are needed to combat both known and emerging disease threats. RNA interference and small interfering (si)RNAs were initially hailed as a \u201Cmagic bullet\u201D, due to their ability to inhibit the synthesis of any protein via the degradation of its complementary messenger RNA sequence. Of particular interest was the potential for attenuating viral mRNAs contributing to the pathogenesis of disease that were not able to be targeted by vaccines or antiviral drugs. However, it was soon discovered that delivery of active siRNA molecules to the infection site in vivo was considerably more difficult than anticipated, due to a number of physiological barriers in the body. This spurred a new wave of investigation into nucleic acid delivery vehicles which could facilitate safe, targeted and effective administration of the siRNA as therapy. Amongst these, cationic polymer delivery vehicles have emerged as a promising candidate as they are low-cost and easy to produce at an industrial scale, and bind to the siRNA by non-specific electrostatic interactions. These nanoparticles (NPs) can be functionally designed to target the infection site, improve uptake in infected cells, release the siRNA inside the endosome and facilitate delivery into the cell cytoplasm. They may also have the added benefit of acting as adjuvants. This chapter provides a background around problems associated with the translation of siRNA as antiviral treatments, reviews the progress made in nucleic acid therapeutics and discusses current methods and progress in overcoming these challenges. It also addresses the importance of combining physicochemical characterisation of the NPs with in vitro and in vivo data.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Nicholas; Dearnley, Megan; Hinton, Tracey M.","journal":"Top Curr Chem (Cham)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa4ee3cd534cb999334266e0ed9e0376dbef4204.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28324594/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41061-017-0127-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["translation of siRNA","delivery of active siRNA molecules","nucleic acid delivery vehicles","antiviral treatments","antiviral drugs","hepatitis viruses","Predominant viruses","respiratory viruses","progress","infection site","cationic polymer delivery vehicles","antiviral drug technology","Viral diseases","viral mRNAs","cost-effective antiviral strategies","NPs","nucleic acid therapeutics","range of viral infections","RNA interference","pathogenesis of disease","emerging disease threats","complementary messenger RNA sequence","human immunodeficiency virus","degradation","current methods","small interfering","new wave of investigation","infected cells","year","advances","promising candidate","problems","uptake","effective administration","major cause of death","number of physiological barriers","body","synthesis","background","protein","physicochemical characterisation","potential","people","vaccines","non-specific electrostatic interactions","therapy","endosome","industrial scale","cell cytoplasm","added benefit","adjuvants","ability","importance","chapter","challenges","magic bullet","nanoparticles","data"],"language":"en"},

Effective emergency preparedness is more likely to be achieved if an all-hazards response plan is adopted. OBJECTIVES: To investigate if there is a relationship among hospitals\u0027 preparedness for various emergency scenarios, and whether components of one emergency scenario correlate with preparedness for other emergency scenarios. METHODS: Emergency preparedness levels of all acute-care hospitals for MCEs, MTEs, and biological events were evaluated, utilizing a structured evaluation tool based on measurable parameters. Evaluations were made by professional experts in two phases: evaluation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) followed by a site visit. Relationships among total preparedness and different components\u0027 scores for various types of emergencies were analyzed. RESULTS: Significant relationships were found among preparedness for different emergencies. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for biological events correlated with preparedness for all investigated emergency scenarios. Strong correlations were found between training and drills with preparedness for all investigated emergency scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental critical building blocks such as SOPs, training, and drill programs improve preparedness for different emergencies including MCEs, MTEs, and biological events, more than other building blocks, such as equipment or knowledge of personnel. SOPs are especially important in unfamiliar emergency scenarios. The findings support the adoption of an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness.","publish_time":"2012-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adini, Bruria; Goldberg, Avishay; Cohen, Robert; Laor, Daniel; Bar-Dayan, Yaron","journal":"Isr J Health Policy Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/624d182cc7495a9fd996eb51663e8774a42d2cca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3494498.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2045-4015-1-40; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23098065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard Operating Procedures"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Emergency preparedness levels","Effective emergency preparedness","various emergency scenarios","total preparedness","hospitals\u0027 preparedness","investigated emergency scenarios","biological events","unfamiliar emergency scenarios","SOPs","chemical events","different emergencies","MCEs","mass casualty events","MTEs","various types of emergencies","training","evaluation of standard operating procedures","different components\u0027 scores","all-hazards approach","mass toxicological","Fundamental critical building blocks","all-hazards response plan","Significant relationships","structured evaluation tool","phases","drill programs","acute-care hospitals","pandemics","drills","professional experts","measurable parameters","equipment","adoption","CONCLUSIONS","bio-terror agents","METHODS","knowledge of personnel","Strong correlations","decade","Evaluations","RESULTS","findings","need","site visit","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the pathologic changes of organ systems and the clinicopathologic basis for severe and fatal outcomes. DESIGN Prospective autopsy study. SETTING Single pathology department. PARTICIPANTS 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 (10 of whom were selected at random for autopsy). MEASUREMENTS Systematic macroscopic, histopathologic, and viral analysis (SARS-CoV-2 on real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), with correlation of pathologic and clinical features, including comorbidities, comedication, and laboratory values. RESULTS Patients\u0027 age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 80.5 years; 8 men, 3 women). Ten of the 11 patients received prophylactic anticoagulant therapy; venous thromboembolism was not clinically suspected antemortem in any of the patients. Both lungs showed various stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts. Thrombosis of small and mid-sized pulmonary arteries was found in various degrees in all 11 patients and was associated with infarction in 8 patients and bronchopneumonia in 6 patients. Kupffer cell proliferation was seen in all patients, and chronic hepatic congestion in 8 patients. Other changes in the liver included hepatic steatosis, portal fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates and ductular proliferation, lobular cholestasis, and acute liver cell necrosis, together with central vein thrombosis. Additional frequent findings included renal proximal tubular injury, focal pancreatitis, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and lymphocyte depletion of spleen and lymph nodes. Viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal, bronchial, and colonic mucosa but not bile. LIMITATION The sample was small. CONCLUSION COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency. Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory, and imaging studies and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.

However, the role of antifibrotic therapy in patients with IPF who contract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the scientific rationale for their continuation or cessation, is poorly defined. Furthermore, several licensed and potential antifibrotic compounds have been assessed in models of acute lung injury and viral pneumonia. Data from previous coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest there could be substantial fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antifibrotic therapies that are available or in development could have value in preventing severe COVID-19 in patients with IPF, have the potential to treat severe COVID-19 in patients without IPF, and might have a role in preventing fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"George, Peter M; Wells, Athol U; Jenkins, R Gisli","journal":"The Lancet.

However, m336 was found to have reduced efficacy against MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD, and HR2P-M2 showed low potency, thus limiting the clinical application of each when administered separately. However, we herein report that the combination of m336 and HR2P-M2 exhibited potent synergism in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and infection by MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with or without mutations in the RBD, resulting in the enhancement of antiviral activity in contrast to either one administered alone.

The objective of this study was to attenuate this strain by serial passaging in MARC-145 cells and assess its virulence and immunogenicity in pigs. The A2MC2 serially passaged 90 times (A2MC2-P90) retains the feature of interferon induction. The A2MC2-P90 replicates faster with a higher virus yield than wild type A2MC2 virus. Infection of primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also induces interferons. Sequence analysis showed that the A2MC2-P90 has genomic nucleic acid identity of 99.8% to the wild type but has a deletion of 543 nucleotides in nsp2. The deletion occurred in passage 60. The A2MC2-P90 genome has a total of 35 nucleotide variations from the wild type, leading to 26 amino acid differences. Inoculation of three-week-old piglets showed that A2MC2-P90 is avirulent and elicits immune response. Compared with Ingelvac PRRS(\u00AE) MLV strain, A2MC2-P90 elicits higher virus neutralizing antibodies. The attenuated IFN-inducing A2MC2-P90 should be useful for development of an improved PRRSV vaccine.","publish_time":"2016-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Zexu; Yu, Ying; Xiao, Yueqiang; Opriessnig, Tanja; Wang, Rong; Yang, Liping; Nan, Yuchen; Samal, Siba K.; Halbur, Patrick G.; Zhang, Yan-Jin","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/126b264339dd9d8ee65cc747822e16c83af57e12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5090871.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep36312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27805024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strain A2MC2","A2MC2-P90 genome","A2MC2-P90 replicates","wild type A2MC2 virus","higher virus","respiratory syndrome virus","MLV strain","interferons","deletion","cultured cells","improved PRRSV vaccine","amino acid differences","genomic nucleic acid identity","Infection of primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages","PAMs","development","total","nucleotide variations","week-old piglets","serial passaging","MARC","avirulent","virulence","immunogenicity","Ingelvac PRRS","immune response","feature of interferon induction","attenuated IFN","antibodies","times","Sequence analysis","pigs","Inoculation","nucleotides","nsp2","study","objective","passage"],"language":"en"},

These plants act as protein factories that can synthesize a variety of proteins free from pathogens such as plasma proteins, growth factors, and vaccines. This method provides a novel, tempting, inexpensive, easy, and safe alternative to other techniques of protein or antigen production. With the advent of transgenic plants, it is possible to produce unlimited amounts of subunit vaccines (for oral use/edible and of parenteral use), protein used for pharmaceutical/medicinal purpose, recombinant proteins, antibodies, and industrial enzymes. Plants have numerous advantages over the production systems on account of scalability, safety, and are economic; for example, less cost of production is involved for Hepatitis B nucleocapsid antigen using transgenic tobacco. Biopharming or molecular farming provides an important resource for cheaper drug production used in the treatment of cancer, heart diseases, and infectious diseases. The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by genetically engineered plants that are extracted and purified, also known as pharmaceuticals produced by plants. Edible vaccines are cheaper in cost, easy to administer mostly by oral route, fail-safe, and are acceptable by society especially in developing countries. These vaccines are targeted to provide systemic as well as mucosal types of immunity. It has been predicted that in future children may get their immunization by munching on foods instead of getting enduring shots. The production of edible vaccines consists of the process of introducing the selected genes of desired quality into plant to induce these altered or transgenic plants to produce the encoded proteins in a natural way. These vaccines provide safer alternatives and help in reduction of cost of production and shipping and also decrease the potential hazards associated with conventional vaccines. However, becoming a reality and readily availability of edible vaccine is challenged by many problems of technical, regulatory, and nonscientific issues, which should be ruled out and rectified. This chapter provides insight into the current scenario and future applications of this new preventive modality.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munshi, Anjana; Sharma, Vandana","journal":"Omics Technologies and Bio-Engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5b9e163cb1a1071368da7bbb3f16382199cbc81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150077.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128158708000085; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128158708000085","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of edible vaccines","cost of production","antigen production","production systems","production of metabolites","conventional vaccines","engineered plants","advent of transgenic plants","cheaper drug production","recombinant proteins","plasma proteins","encoded proteins","proteins of medicinal value","unlimited amounts of subunit vaccines","variety of proteins free","oral use","transgenic tobacco","techniques of protein","reduction of cost","protein factories","availability of edible vaccine","Abstract Molecular farming","medicinal purpose","parenteral use","future applications","heart diseases","oral route","infectious diseases","future children","pharmaceutical products","Hepatitis B nucleocapsid antigen","important resource","antibodies","pathogens","unprecedented approach","current scenario","treatment of cancer","account of scalability","safe alternative","shipping","selected genes of desired quality","growth factors","new preventive modality","numerous advantages","society","safety","problems of technical","insight","fail-safe","potential hazards","process","industrial enzymes","safer alternatives","foods","nonscientific issues","developing countries","chapter","immunization","novel","reality","Biopharming","natural way","example","mucosal types of immunity","enduring shots","agricultural setting","method","pharmaceuticals"],"language":"en"},

Northern blot analysis revealed that the aadA and BACE genes were both properly transcribed into a dicistronic transcriptional unit. Human BACE protein expression in transplastomic tobacco was determined by western blot analysis. ELISA analysis revealed that, based on a dilution series of E. coli-derived BACE as a standard, transplastomic lines accumulated BACE to levels of 2.0% of total soluble proteins. When mice were gavaged with the transplastomic tobacco extracts, they showed an immune response against the BACE antigen.

These examples as well as the results from an empirical study provide useful insights for the design and administration of future pools and clearinghouses in the life sciences.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Zimmeren, Esther; Vanneste, Sven; Matthijs, Gert; Vanhaverbeke, Wim; Van Overwalle, Geertrui","journal":"Trends in Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1e799332cffd1ccd0a775083f570c14af260cd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125884.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167779911000965; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2011.06.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779911000965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21733589/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GlaxoSmithKline","BIO Ventures","Global Health","Medicines Patent Pool","UNITAID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patent pools","Medicines Patent Pool","administration of future pools","clearinghouses","patents","idea of collaborative patent licensing models","Various organizations","various technology fields","Neglected Tropical Diseases","BVGH","design","useful insights","Global Health","Open Innovation","empirical study","results","BIO Ventures","GlaxoSmithKline","MPP","MPEG LA","humanitarian dimension","life sciences","GSK","molecular diagnostics","countries","biopharmaceutical industry","attempt","different actors","UNITAID","examples"],"language":"en"},

Guanines of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) bound with thrombin do not react with 3,4,5-trimethoxylphenylglyoxal (TMPG) in the presence of tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide (TPA), whereas guanines of free TBA- and TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of graphene oxide rapidly react with TMPG to emit light. Thus, guanine chemiluminescence in 5% human serum with thrombin was lower than that without thrombin when TBA-conjugated 6-FAM was added in two samples and incubated for 20min. In other words, the brightness of guanine chemiluminescence was quenched due to the formation of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated 6-FAM bound with thrombin in a sample. High-energy intermediate, capable of emitting dim light by itself, formed from the reaction between guanines of TBA and TMPG in the presence of TPA, transfers energy to 6-FAM to emit bright light based on the principle of chemiluminescence energy transfer (CRET). G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor devised using the rapid interaction between TBA-conjugated 6-FAM and thrombin quantified trace levels of thrombin without complicated procedures. The limit of detection (LOD=background\u002B3\u00D7standard deviation) of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with good linear calibration curve, accuracy, precision, and recovery was as low as 12.3nM in 5% human serum. Using the technology reported in this research, we expect that various types of G-quadruplex DNA aptasensors capable of specifically sensing a target molecule such as ATP, HIV, ochratoxin, potassium ions, and thrombin can be developed.","publish_time":"2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Sandy; Park, Lucienne; Chong, Richard; Kim, Young Teck; Lee, Ji Hoon","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88def2a04604c4a9a918c9273bfc8d336323045f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24080210/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566313006350; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566313006350; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.09.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["guanines of TBA","G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor","FAM","quadruplex TBA-conjugated carboxyfluorescein","quantifying thrombin","thrombin aptamer","guanines of free TBA","Guanines of G","thrombin quantified trace levels of thrombin","G-quadruplex DNA aptamers","formation of G","quadruplex DNA aptasensors capable","guanine chemiluminescence detection capable","human serum","TMPG","various types of G","brightness of guanine chemiluminescence","sensitive aptasensor","presence of TPA","principle of chemiluminescence energy transfer","capable of emitting dim light","complicated procedures","bright light","presence of tetra","limit of detection","transfers energy","good linear calibration curve","HIV","precision","accuracy","expensive nanoparticles","ATP","background","n-propylammonium hydroxide","ochratoxin","standard deviation","target molecule","potassium ions","rapid interaction","recovery","LOD","CRET","nM","surface of graphene oxide","research","words","reaction","trimethoxylphenylglyoxal","technology","samples"],"language":"en"},

However, the benefit and cost-effectiveness vary in each country or community because they have different standard practices and health care systems. In Japan, rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been frequently used for pediatric respiratory infections. We investigated the impact and cost-effectiveness of a multiplex PCR (mPCR) respiratory panel for pediatric respiratory infections in a Japanese community hospital. Methods We replaced RATs with an mPCR respiratory panel (FilmArray\u00AE) for admitted pediatric respiratory infections on March 26, 2018. We compared the days of antimicrobial therapy (DOT) and length of stay (LOS) during the mPCR period (March 2018 to April 2019) with those of the RAT period (March 2012 to March 2018). Results During the RAT and mPCR periods, 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed. The DOT/case was 12.82 vs 8.56 (p \u003C 0.001), and the LOS was 8.18 vs 6.83 days (p = 0.032) in the RAT and mPCR groups, respectively. The total costs during admissions were \u2216258,824 ($2331.7) and \u2216243,841 ($2196.8)/case, respectively. Pathogen detection rates were 30.2% vs 87.2% (p \u003C 0.001). Conclusion Compared to conventional RATs, the mPCR test contributed to a reduction in the DOT and LOS in a Japanese community hospital for admission-requiring pediatric respiratory infections. However, a proper stewardship program is essential to further reduce the unnecessary usage of antimicrobials.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kitano, Taito; Nishikawa, Hiroki; Suzuki, Rika; Onaka, Masayuki; Nishiyama, Atsuko; Kitagawa, Daisuke; Oka, Miyako; Masuo, Kazue; Yoshida, Sayaka","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128379.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383498/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2019.07.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X19302181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X19302181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric respiratory infections","mPCR respiratory panel","mPCR periods","mPCR test","mPCR groups","DOT","LOS","vs","RAT period","Japanese community hospital","conventional RATs","cost-effectiveness","antimicrobial stewardship","case","Abstract Background Rapid molecular diagnosis of infections","days of antimicrobial therapy","rapid antigen tests","proper stewardship program","different standard practices","multiplex PCR","health care systems","FilmArray","timely treatments","length of stay","country","reduction","impact","Pathogen detection rates","Results","unnecessary usage of antimicrobials","total costs","admissions","benefit","Conclusion","patients","Methods"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA-seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2. In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP-seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues. Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yuanyuan; Li, Honggang; Zhou, Liquan","journal":"Biochem Biophys Res Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73b55d827817219723de3b377e473c4526678218.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144854.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20307087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291076/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20307087","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["upregulation of Ace2 expression","ACE2 promoter region","human cells","high level of ACE2","Human germ cells","mammalian cells","host cells","SARS-CoV","EZH2-mediated H3K27me3","reduction of H3K27me3","human embryonic stem cells","decrease of H3K27me3 signal","major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3","absence of EZH2","EZH2 knockout","infection","adjuvant therapy of COVID","RNA-seq result","H3K27ac signal","mouse germ cell line GC","targeted drug therapy","cell receptor Angiotensin","ChIP-seq analysis","early embryos","prevention","spike glycoprotein","pathogenesis","clues","outbreak of corona virus disease","discovery","H3K4","36me3","emerging health issues","tissues","regulatory pattern","agreement"],"language":"en"},

The general concepts incorporated into the CPIP may be utilised in the contingency planning for a bioterrorism event or other communicable disease emergencies, including: a national, coordinated approach in planning; an emergency management structure to conduct the response; the use of common terminology to facilitate communication and response coordination, and the establishment of specific technical, communications and operational response groups and networks in advance. The multinational outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 offered the opportunity for the testing of these concepts.

Despite past and current intensive vaccination programs, IBV infections in the country\u2019s poultry industry have not been effectively controlled. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the genotype of several isolates based on partial S1 gene sequences. In particular, the investigation is directed to focus on layer chickens in actively vaccinated farms indicating IBV symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were isolated from ten different layer chicken flocks experiencing respiratory problem, drops in egg production, and a \u201Cpenguin-like\u201D stance, which were collected from commercial poultry farms in Central Java and Yogyakarta regions, Indonesia, within the periods of 2012-2018. Fragment of the S1 gene of IBV sampled from actively vaccinated commercial poultry farms was amplified using primer 5\u2019-aca tgg taa ttt ttc aga tgg-3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019-cag att gct tac aac cac c-3\u2019 (reverse) with the length of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product at 383 bp. The sequence of samples was then compared with the sequence of reference S1 gene nucleotides of IBV from NCBI GenBank database. The amino acid analysis and multiple alignment sequence were conducted using Mega X. RESULTS: During necropsy, enlargement of the oviduct and swollen kidney were observed. Reverse transcription-PCR diagnosis of their 383 bp S1 gene showed that all samples were IBV positive. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene discovered seven samples to be clustered as 4/91-like strains. Meanwhile, the remaining three samples were grouped in QX-like strain cluster. CONCLUSION: This study is a pioneering report providing molecular evidence of pathogenic QX-like and 4/91-like strains circulating in Indonesia. Findings discovered, in this study, strongly suggested the importance of improving protections by available IBV vaccines through updated circulating strain clusters. It is critical to ensure the delivery of an effective control measurement of and vaccination protocols against IBV infections in the country\u2019s commercial poultry industry in particular and worldwide in general.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wibowo, Michael H.; Ginting, Teridah E.; Asmara, Widya","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/936a08054b4018e58ae70402e8918715904451ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6460877.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040571/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.277-287","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Central Java","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["S1 gene of IBV","IBV infections","IBV symptoms","IBV positive","sequence of samples","sequence of reference S1 gene nucleotides of IBV","bp S1 gene","available IBV vaccines","vaccinated commercial poultry farms","partial S1 gene sequences","Indonesia","study","country\u2019s commercial poultry industry","country\u2019s poultry industry","vaccinated farms","multiple alignment sequence","distributed vaccine strains","vaccination protocols","layer chickens","Reverse transcription-PCR diagnosis","updated circulating strain clusters","Phylogenetic analysis","amino acid analysis","aca tgg taa ttt ttc aga tgg","current intensive vaccination programs","different layer chicken flocks","molecular evidence of pathogenic QX","respiratory problem","Central Java","pioneering report","Yogyakarta regions","primer","characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus","Existing data","tac aac cac c","effective control measurement","length of polymerase chain reaction","enlargement","cag att","protections","isolates","NCBI GenBank database","variants similar","oviduct","delivery","necropsy","egg production","AIM","RESULTS","importance","penguin","swollen kidney","BACKGROUND","genotype","Fragment","CONCLUSION","periods","stance","investigation","MATERIALS","METHODS","Findings"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, the efficacy of an individual neutralizing MAb may significantly be hampered by the potential absence or modification of its target epitope in a mutant or subtype of the infectious agent. These limitations of individual neutralizing MAbs can be overcome by using oligoclonal combinations of several MAbs with different specificities to the target antigen. Studies conducted in our lab and by others show that such combined MAb preparation may present substantial synergy in its potency over the calculated additive potency of its individual MAb components. Moreover, oligoclonal preparation is expected to be better suited to compensating for reduced efficacy due to epitope variation. In this review, the synergistic neutralization properties of combined oligoclonal Ab preparations are described. The effect of Ab affinity, autologous Fc fraction, and targeting a critical number of epitopes, as well as the unexpected contribution of non-neutralizing clones to the synergistic neutralizing effect are presented and discussed.","publish_time":"2015-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diamant, Eran; Torgeman, Amram; Ozeri, Eyal; Zichel, Ran","journal":"Toxins (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e17fa07642900d9491bf957db97cbe70bc39610.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4488679.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035486/; https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins7061854","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MAbs potency","limitations of individual neutralizing MAbs","synergistic neutralizing effect","oligoclonal preparation","combined MAb preparation","individual MAb components","synergistic neutralization properties of combined oligoclonal Ab preparations","effect of Ab affinity","target epitope","oligoclonal combinations","conventional polyclonal Ab preparations","calculated additive potency","unexpected contribution of non-neutralizing clones","neutralization of toxins","target antigen","reduced efficacy","epitope variation","autologous Fc fraction","different specificities","substantial synergy","subtype","modification","potential absence","critical number of epitopes","infectious agent","broad range of indications","bacteria","viruses","review","Monoclonal antibodies","growing therapeutics","Studies","lab"],"language":"en"},

The mechanisms that lead to mortality in these children are poorly understood. Studies of the cellular immunology of the infant airway have traditionally been hindered by the limited sample volumes available from the young, frail children who are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This is further compounded by the relatively low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes that are thought to be critical to the clinical outcome of pneumonia. To address this, we developed a novel in-silico deconvolution method for inferring the frequencies of immune cell phenotypes in the airway of children with different survival outcomes using proteomic data. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified \u003E 1,000 proteins expressed in the airways of children who were admitted to hospital with clinical pneumonia. 61 of these children were discharged from hospital and survived for more than 365 days after discharge, while 19 died during admission. We used machine learning by random forest to derive protein features that could be used to deconvolve immune cell phenotypes in paediatric airway samples. We applied these phenotype-specific signatures to identify airway-resident immune cell phenotypes that were differentially enriched by survival status and validated the findings using a large retrospective pneumonia cohort. We identified immune-cell phenotype classification features for 33 immune cell types. Eosinophil-associated features were significantly elevated in airway samples obtained from pneumonia survivors and were downregulated in children who subsequently died. To confirm these results, we analyzed clinical parameters from \u003E10,000 children who had been admitted with pneumonia in the previous 10 years. The results of this retrospective analysis mirrored airway deconvolution data and showed that survivors had significantly elevated eosinophils at admission compared to fatal pneumonia. Using a proteomics bioinformatics approach, we identify airway eosinophils as a critical factor for pneumonia survival in infants and young children.","publish_time":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sande, Charles J; Waeni, Jacqueline M; Njunge, James M; Mutunga, Martin N; Gicheru, Elijah; Kibinge, Nelson K; Gwela, Agnes","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a3de625119a83aa1401eeb297937d9605f0d1f1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bf06948b00b9dbb23a9110745ef0259e83985387.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/840090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway of children","pneumonia survival","young children","clinical pneumonia","pneumonia survivors","fatal pneumonia","frail children","airways of children","airway-resident immune cell phenotypes","airway eosinophils","frequencies of immune cell phenotypes","immune cell types","clinical outcome of pneumonia","infant airway","immune-cell phenotype classification features","paediatric airway samples","low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes","large retrospective pneumonia cohort","hospital","retrospective analysis mirrored airway deconvolution data","infants","protein features","survival status","elevated eosinophils","results","admission","clinical parameters","different survival outcomes","Eosinophil-associated features","critical factor","proteomic data","silico deconvolution method","phenotype-specific signatures","leading cause of mortality","findings","random forest","limited sample volumes available","cellular immunology","proteomics bioinformatics approach","machine learning","novel","proteins","high-resolution mass spectrometry","Studies","discharge","years","days","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

This study was aimed to investigate the impact of the pandemic on age-specific epidemic curves of other respiratory viruses. METHODS: Weekly laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtypes seasonal A(H1N1), A(H3N2), pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza were obtained from 2004 to 2013. Age-specific epidemic curves of viruses other than A(H1N1)pdm09 were compared between the pre-pandemic (May 2004 \u2013 April 2009), pandemic (May 2009 \u2013 April 2010) and post-pandemic periods (May 2010 \u2013 April 2013). RESULTS: There were two peaks of A(H1N1)pdm09 in Hong Kong, the first in September 2009 and the second in February 2011. The infection rate was found highest in young children in both waves, but markedly fewer cases in school children were recorded in the second wave than in the first wave. Positive proportions of viruses other than A(H1N1)pdm09 markedly decreased in all age groups during the first pandemic wave. After the first wave of the pandemic, the positive proportion of A(H3N2) increased, but those of B and RSV remained slightly lower than their pre-pandemic proportions. Changes in seasonal pattern and epidemic peak time were also observed, but inconsistent across virus-age groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide some evidence that age distribution, seasonal pattern and peak time of other respiratory viruses have changed since the pandemic. These changes could be the result of immune interference and changing health seeking behavior, but the mechanism behind still needs further investigations.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Lin; Chan, Kwok Hung; Suen, Lorna K.

The tetraspanin hCD81 contains a large extracellular loop (LEL), which interacts with the E2 glycoprotein of HCV. The role of the non-LEL regions of hCD81 (intracellular tails, four transmembrane domains, small extracellular loop and intracellular loop) is poorly understood. Here, we studied the contribution of these domains to HCV susceptibility of hepatoma cells by generating chimeras of related tetraspanins with the hCD81 LEL. Our results show that non-LEL regions in addition to the LEL determine susceptibility of cells to HCV. While closely related tetraspanins (X. tropicalis CD81 and D. rerio CD81) functionally complement hCD81 non-LEL regions, distantly related tetraspanins (C. elegans TSP9 amd D. melanogaster TSP96F) do not and tetraspanins with intermediate homology (hCD9) show an intermediate phenotype. Tetraspanin homology and susceptibility to HCV correlate positively. For some chimeras, infectivity correlates with surface expression. In contrast, the hCD9 chimera is fully surface expressed, binds HCV E2 glycoprotein but is impaired in HCV receptor function. We demonstrate that a cholesterol-coordinating glutamate residue in CD81, which hCD9 lacks, promotes HCV infection. This work highlights the hCD81 non-LEL regions as additional HCV susceptibility-determining factors.","publish_time":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banse, Pia; Moeller, Rebecca; Bruening, Janina; Lasswitz, Lisa; Kahl, Sina; Khan, Abdul G.; Marcotrigiano, Joseph; Pietschmann, Thomas; Gerold, Gisa","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e10083014ab2d0c09bd8bed432e8ca883d8d3431.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923501.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29677132/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10040207","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hCD81 LEL","non-LEL regions of hCD81","hCD81 non-LEL regions","HCV infection","additional HCV susceptibility","E2 glycoprotein of HCV","HCV E2 glycoprotein","HCV susceptibility of hepatoma cells","tetraspanin hCD81","HCV receptor function","chimeras of related tetraspanins","susceptibility of cells","human CD81","intracellular loop","tropicalis CD81","rerio CD81","small extracellular loop","large extracellular loop","hCD9 lacks","hCD9 chimera","Tetraspanin homology","intermediate homology","transmembrane domains","intracellular tails","human hepatocytes","surface expression","intermediate phenotype","essential entry factors","elegans TSP9 amd","melanogaster TSP96F","glutamate residue","infectivity correlates","Hepatitis C virus","work","cholesterol","contribution","role","results","contrast"],"language":"en"},

To gain insight into the biological properties of BatIVs, we generated vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) pseudotyped with the BatIV HA and NA. We found that VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV HAs and NAs efficiently infected particular bat cell lines but not those derived from primates, and that proteolytic cleavage with a trypsin-like protease was necessary for HA-mediated virus entry. Treatment of the susceptible bat cells with some enzymes and inhibitors revealed that BatIV HAs might recognize some cellular glycoproteins as receptors rather than the sialic acids used for the other known influenza viruses.

Additionally, we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of HCoV-OC43 through the central nervous system (CNS) of live BALB/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. We found that rOC43-ns2DelRluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation, and that viral titers and Rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. Moreover, viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of BALB/c mice, consistent with its tropism in the CNS. Furthermore, the Rluc readout correlated with the HCoV replication ability and protein expression, which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice. Additionally, we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in vivo.

Very limited information is known about the regularities of transmission, genetic and biological characteristics of AAvV\u20106 because of the lower isolation rate and mild losses for poultry industry.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of observational data on the aetiology, diagnosis and prognosis in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough in 12 European countries (2007\u20132010) using regression analyses corrected for clustering of patients within countries. Age groups were 18\u201359 years, 60\u201374 years, and 75 years and older (75\u002B). RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal swabs for 144 (4.6%), 169 (5.4%) and 104 (3.4%) out of 3104 patients were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for RSV, influenza A and influenza B, respectively. RSV prevalence in patients 75\u002B (8.5%) was twice the prevalence in those under 60 years (4.2%). Influenza prevalence was not associated with age. Diagnostic features for these viruses were not associated with age. Symptom duration was associated with age for RSV and influenza B, but not for influenza A. The odds of unresolved symptoms after 28 days were associated with age for RSV only. Illness deterioration was associated with age for RSV, with patients 75\u002B at increased risk, but not for influenza. CONCLUSION: In adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, the diagnostic features of RSV or influenza infection are not associated with age. For RSV both the prevalence and illness course are significantly worse at higher age, for influenza only the illness course is.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bruyndonckx, Robin; Coenen, Samuel; Butler, Chris; Verheij, Theo; Little, Paul; Hens, Niel; Beutels, Philippe; Ieven, Margareta; Goossens, Herman","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8c527aca16595dce5672f086a30438c830f8562.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167228.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302447; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302447?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320810/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

The results of the analyses show a significant influence of building height on the magnitude of wind speeds in the lift-up area while the width of the central core controls the area with low wind speeds. Tall buildings with short lift-up cores have small areas with acceptable pedestrian wind comfort, which can be increased by adopting corner modifications for the central core. The area of acceptable pedestrian wind comfort increases in oblique wind directions as the areas of high (\u003E3.5 m s\u22121) and low (\u003C1.5 m s\u22121) wind speeds are decreased.

A majority were closely related to proteins of equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2), a horse gammaherpesvirus. We demonstrated by electron microscopy the presence of herpesvirus-like particles in the microbat cells. Passage of supernatants from microbat cells to Vero cells resulted in syncytium formation, and expression of viral genes and amplification of viral DNA were demonstrated by quantitative PCR. Susceptibility of human cell lines to productive infection was also demonstrated. Next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly of the viral genome from supernatants from Vero cells yielded a single contig of approximately 130 kb with at least 77 open reading frames (ORFs), predicted microRNAs (miRNAs), and a gammaherpesvirus genomic organization. Phylogenic analysis of the envelope glycoprotein (gB) and DNA polymerase (POLD1) revealed similarity to multiple gammaherpesviruses, including those from as-yet-uncultured viruses of the Rhadinovirus genus that were obtained by deep sequencing of bat tissues. Moreover, the assembled genome revealed ORFs that share little or no homology to known ORFs in EHV-2 but are similar to accessory proteins of other gammaherpesviruses. Some also have striking homology to predicted Myotis bat proteins. Cumulatively, this study provides the first isolation and characterization of a replication-competent bat gammaherpesvirus. IMPORTANCE Bats are of significant interest as reservoirs for zoonotic viral pathogens; however, tools to dissect bat-virus interactions are limited in availability. This study serendipitously identified, in an established bat cell line, a fully replication-competent gammaherpesvirus; determined the complete genome sequence of the virus; and generated a viral transcript map. This virus can replicate in select human and nonhuman primate cell lines. However, analyses of viral sequences support a bat origin for this virus; we therefore refer to the virus as bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8). The viral genome contains unique open reading frames that likely encode modulators of bat innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways and expresses viral miRNAs. The virus and its gene products should provide a unique tool to dissect both bat and gammaherpesvirus biology.","publish_time":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shabman, Reed S.; Shrivastava, Susmita; Tsibane, Tshidi; Attie, Oliver; Jayaprakash, Anitha; Mire, Chad E.; Dilley, Kari E.; Puri, Vinita; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Geisbert, Thomas W.; Sachidanandam, Ravi; Basler, Christopher F.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b58f76c98afb6435969ef4d9f9a063058265b98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4863610.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00070-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27303702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral genome","bat-virus interactions","viral miRNAs","modulators of bat","bat origin","Myotis bat proteins","replication-competent bat gammaherpesvirus","established bat cell line","deep sequencing of bat tissues","amplification of viral DNA","viral transcript map","microbat cells","horse gammaherpesvirus","gammaherpesvirus biology","expression of viral genes","zoonotic viral pathogens","analyses of viral sequences","replication-competent gammaherpesvirus","Vero cells","ORFs","gammaherpesvirus genomic organization","assembled genome","accessory proteins","proteins of equine herpesvirus","Susceptibility of human cell lines","novo assembly","unique open reading frames","complete genome sequence","nonhuman primate cell lines","EHV","homology","generation sequencing","study","microbat Myotis velifer incautus","DNA polymerase","unique tool","Passage of supernatants","presence of herpesvirus","multiple gammaherpesviruses","predicted microRNAs","mRNA transcript profile","gB","POLD1","syncytium formation","tools","envelope glycoprotein","adaptive immune","mRNAs","similarity","reservoirs","characterization","pathways","high level of identity","Rhadinovirus genus","productive infection","gene products","particles","Phylogenic analysis","single contig","uncultured viruses","electron microscopy","isolation","quantitative PCR","BGHV8","IMPORTANCE Bats","availability","majority"],"language":"en"},

To better understand structural and functional characteristics of Nsp15, 22 mutant versions of Nsp15 were produced in Escherichia coli as His-tagged proteins and purified by metal-affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. Nineteen of the mutants were soluble and were analyzed for enzymatic activity. Six mutants, including four at the putative active site, were significantly reduced in endoribonuclease activity. Two of the inactive mutants had unusual secondary structures compared to the wild-type protein, as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Gel-filtration analysis, velocity sedimentation ultracentrifugation, and native gradient pore electrophoresis all showed that the wild-type protein exists in an equilibrium between hexamers and monomers in solution, with hexamers dominating at micromolar protein concentration, while native gradient pore electrophoresis also revealed the presence of trimers. A mutant in the N terminus of Nsp15 was impaired in hexamer formation and had low endoribonuclease activity, suggesting that oligomerization is required for endoribonuclease activity. This idea was supported by titration experiments showing that enzyme activity was strongly concentration-dependent, indicating that oligomeric Nsp15 is the active form.

The quercetin SLMs were characterised for morphology, drug loading (15.5%\u00B10.6, which corresponded to an encapsulation efficiency of 71.4%), particle size distribution, response to humidity, crystallinity, thermal behaviour and in vitro respirable fraction. Furthermore, the toxicity and the in vitro transport of the SLMs on an air liquid interface model of the Calu-3 cell line were also investigated using a modified twin-stage impinger apparatus.

Conclusions These observations suggest quercetin diffusion was enhanced by the presence of the lipid/emulsifying excipients in the SLMs; however further studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms.","publish_time":"2013-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scalia, Santo; Haghi, Mehra; Losi, Vanessa; Trotta, Valentina; Young, Paul M.; Traini, Daniela","journal":"European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4128de7747acebb55dc9277ad04e696bb41c6cfc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127037.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2013.03.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928098713001140; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928098713001140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quercetin SLMs","micronised quercetin","quercetin diffusion","Methods Quercetin microparticles","Calu","solid lipid microparticles","lipid component","Results Results","fine particle fraction","dry powders","basolateral transport","respirable fraction","drug loading","dry powder suitable","inhalation drug delivery","particle size distribution","linear kinetic model","air liquid interface model","humidity","crystallinity","response","tristearin","present work","phase inversion technique","w emulsification","thermal behaviour","direct administration","presence","modified twin-stage impinger apparatus","aim","phosphatidylcholine","emulsifying excipients","morphology","Abstract Purpose","cell line","emulsifier","\u03BCm","studies","Conclusions","observations","lung","exact mechanisms","period of study","addition","encapsulation efficiency","concentrations","toxicity"],"language":"en"},

Mild acid hydrolysis, which transforms complex carbohydrate to monomeric residues, abrogated the specific activity of M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysates, suggesting that a polysaccharide was required for biological activity. Extraction of MtbWL with chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) resulted in a polar lipid fraction with highly enriched specific activity; this activity was further enriched by silica gel chromatography. A combination of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of bioactive fractions indicated that 6-O-methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharides (mGLP) are predominant components present in this active fraction.

Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Joan C.; Sausville, Erin L.; Girish, Vishruth; Yuan, Monet Lou; Vasudevan, Anand; John, Kristen M.; Sheltzer, Jason M.","journal":"Developmental cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a756653f012e5505ec536a77281bdb663d708a1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580720304019?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425701/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1534580720304019; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.05.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 levels","ACE2 expression","severe SARS-CoV","fatal SARS-CoV","viral infections","lung cells","subset of secretory cells","cell population","interferon treatment","cigarette smoke","concomitant increase","viral dissemination","interferon-stimulated gene","Chronic smoke exposure","single-cell sequencing data","dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin","expansion","abundance","receptor","positive-feedback loops","rodent","smokers","Enzyme","quitting smoking","respiratory tract","contrast","human lungs","factors","work","results"],"language":"en"},

During the ribosomal frameshift event, the gag open reading frame is shifted -1 nt to allow in-phase reading of the pol open reading frame. A consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC within the gag-pol overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been identified followed by a sequence that has the potential for a pseudoknot tertiary structure. Using recombinant baculoviruses in which the frameshift occurs efficiently, the consensus sequence has been shown to be the site of the frameshift event. A mutation creating a termination codon just downstream of the putative frameshift signal sequence but upstream of the potential pseudoknot structure made a shorter gag product, but did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting. A mutation creating a termination codon just upstream of the putative frameshift signal made a shorter product and essentially abrogated frameshifting. Mutations in the first stem or the second stem in the potential pseudoknot structure severely reduced the frameshifting efficiency. Mutations which altered the length between the frameshift signal and the pseudoknot structure (the so-called spacer region) also reduced the frameshift efficiency. The insertion of a palindromic sequence, which could form a hairpin structure just upstream of the frameshift signal sequence, also affected the frameshifting. These results support the view that the ribosomal frameshift event in the FIV gag-pol region involves the identified signal sequence and appears to require the precisely positioned downstream sequence and indicated pseudoknot structure for efficient frameshifting.","publish_time":"1992-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morikawa, Shigeru; Bishop, David H.L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0d33bca612ddb67f1029465657ff93c2b1e6e5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682292900049; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682292900049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["putative frameshift signal sequence","frameshift efficiency","consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC","ribosomal frameshift event","identified signal sequence","consensus sequence","downstream sequence","potential pseudoknot structure","FIV gag-pol region","ribosomal frameshifting","palindromic sequence","efficiency of frameshifting","frameshifting efficiency","pseudoknot tertiary structure","gag-pol fusion proteins","hairpin structure","efficient frameshifting","abrogated frameshifting","shorter gag product","gag open reading frame","pol open reading frame","pol genes of retroviruses","phase reading","shorter product","so-called spacer region","termination codon","stem","Mutations","region of feline immunodeficiency virus","view","length","results","insertion","recombinant baculoviruses","site"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we will focus on the practical management of patients with lymphoid malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on minimizing the risk for patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perini, Guilherme Fleury; Fischer, Thais; Gaiolla, Rafael Dezen; Rocha, Talita Bueno; Bellesso, Marcelo; Teixeira, Larissa Lane Cardoso; Delamain, Marcia Torresan; Scheliga, Adriana Alves de Souza; Ribeiro, Glaciano Nogueira; Neto, Jorge Vaz; Baiocchi, Ot\u00E1vio Cesar Carvalho Guimaraes; Abdo, Andr\u00E9 Neder Ramires; Arrais-Rodrigues, Celso; Fogliatto, Laura M.; Bigni, Ricardo de S\u00E1; Schaffel, Rony; Biasoli, Irene; Pereira, Juliana; Nablan, Samir Kanaan; Souza, C\u00E1rmino Ant\u00F4nio de; Chiattone, Carlos S\u00E9rgio","journal":"Hematol Transfus Cell Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/777a9de0eab6a83cf7ebd2dd84a16c079e533275.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164906.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2020.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S253113792030033X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S253113792030033X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cancer patients","practical management of patients","lymphoid malignancies","CoVid","outbreak","higher risk of intensive care unit","world pandemic","chemotherapy","immunosuppression","ICU","severe disease","radiotherapy","admissions","multiple hospital visits","stem cell transplantation","invasive ventilation","novel Coronavirus","death","people","article"],"language":"en"},

The continuous emergence of a multitude of IBV variants poses many challenges for its diagnosis and control, and live attenuated vaccines, despite their routine use, still plays a significant role in driving IBV evolution, further complicating the epidemiological scenario. Unfortunately, the impact of different vaccination strategies on IB control, epidemiology, and diagnosis has rarely been investigated. This work presents the results of a large-scale diagnostic survey performed in Poland to study IBV molecular epidemiology and how vaccination may affect the viral circulation in the field. To this purpose, 589 samples were collected between May 2017 and January 2019, tested by reverse transcription-PCR for IBV and sequenced. Vaccine and field strains were discriminated based on genetic and anamnestic information. The most commonly detected lineages were 793B (79%) and variant 2 (17.4%), with sporadic detections of QX, Mass, and D274-like strains. Most of the detected strains had a vaccine origin: 46.3% matched one of the applied vaccines, while 36.5% were genetically related to vaccines not implemented in the respective protocol. Besides their practical value for the proper planning of vaccination protocols in Poland, these results suggest that only a fraction (17.2%) of the circulating strains are field ones, imposing a careful assessment of the actual IBV field menaces. Moreover, phenomena like vaccine spreading and persistence seem to occur commonly, stressing the need to further study the epidemiological consequences of the extensive use of live vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Legnardi, Matteo; Franzo, Giovanni; Koutoulis, Konstantinos C; Wi\u015Bniewski, Marek; Catelli, Elena; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Cecchinato, Mattia","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b574bf0f935b4f092e6df566f24ce24020474b66.json; document_parses/pdf_json/319b8c97174d684a0e0f50dff4ecfdab294d2a05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6870560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399745/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119579457; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez473; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119579457","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["field strains","actual IBV field menaces","detected strains","study IBV molecular epidemiology","multitude of IBV variants","driving IBV evolution","field ones","circulating strains","applied vaccines","live attenuated vaccines","extensive use of live vaccines","Poland","IB control","results","diagnosis","vaccine origin","infectious bronchitis virus","proper planning of vaccination protocols","impact of different vaccination strategies","routine use","epidemiological consequences","epidemiological scenario","detected lineages","careful assessment","account","severe economic losses","significant role","large-scale diagnostic survey","Mass","challenges","poultry industry","reverse transcription-PCR","practical value","continuous emergence","sporadic detections of QX","D274","viral circulation","anamnestic information","need","work","phenomena","persistence","respective protocol","purpose","samples","fraction"],"language":"en"},

Within 24 h of hospital admission, a total of 922 patients aged \u226560 years were interviewed for symptoms of ongoing respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic patients were swabbed for oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal presence of viral pathogens immediately by members of the study group. During a 2-month period, non-symptomatic volunteers among interviewed patients were swabbed as well (controls). Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed with real-time PCR for nine common respiratory viruses. A total of 147 out of 173 symptomatic patients and 56 non-symptomatic patients (controls) agreed to participate in the study. The patients were allocated to three cohorts: (1) symptomatic and PCR-positive (S/PCR\u002B), (2) symptomatic and PCR-negative (S/PCR\u2212), or (3) non-symptomatic and PCR-negative (control). There were no non-symptomatic patients with a positive PCR result. A non-significant difference in the frequency of empiric antibiotic administration was found when comparing the S/PCR\u002B to the S/PCR\u2212 cohort; 16/19 (84 %) vs. 99/128 (77 %) (\u03C7(2) = 0.49). Antibiotic treatment was withdrawn in only two patients in the S/PCR\u002B cohort after receiving a positive viral diagnosis.

We reviewed the history of NVAC in the context of the principles of its establishment, with a focus on its reports and recommendations. We performed a systematic literature review to identify NVAC reports published in widely-accessible public health journals, and we reviewed the available archives to identify other reports and resolutions approved by the committee not published in journals. We characterized key issues considered by NVAC according to the five goals of the 2010 National Vaccine Plan. The predominance of NVAC activities to date related to the implementation of immunization across the lifespan and the many aspects of the system needed to foster the goal of full immunization. Reflecting on the impacts of NVAC to date, this review identified 30 NVAC approved reports published in journals, 22 stand-alone resolutions, and 26 unique unpublished reports. The development of new and improved vaccines continues to represent a significant priority for NVAC, and we identified several challenges related to future vaccine innovation. Given the many factors that impact on policy changes in the vaccine and immunization enterprise, we encountered challenges associated with demonstrating attribution of specific policy changes to NVAC recommendations. Although difficult to quantify, this review suggests that NVAC played an important role in the improvements in the U.S. immunization enterprise over the past 30 years and that NVAC can and will continue to play an important role supporting U.S. immunization going forward.","publish_time":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Kimberly M.; Gellin, Bruce G.; Hinman, Alan R.; Orenstein, Walter A.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91531177c812eedf1e965f086c510c6e603250ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115546.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422369/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18301294; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18301294","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Vaccine Advisory Committee","NVAC"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["NVAC reports","NVAC recommendations","NVAC approved reports","history of NVAC","impacts of NVAC","immunization enterprise","predominance of NVAC activities","implementation of immunization","National Vaccine Plan","National Vaccine Advisory Committee","important role","unique unpublished reports","future vaccine innovation","challenges","date","systematic literature review","years","NVAC\u2019s role","accessible public health journals","optimal prevention of human infectious diseases","improved vaccines","Department of Health","stand-alone resolutions","Human Services","demonstrating attribution of specific policy changes","external advisor","passage of legislation","adverse reactions","context","goals","improvements","significant priority","establishment","development of new","lifespan","principles","factors","focus","available archives","aspects","key issues"],"language":"en"},

A successful viral infection requires fusion between virus and host cells carried out by the surface spike glycoprotein or S protein of CoV. Current models propose that the S2 subunit of S protein assembled into a hexameric helical bundle exposing hydrophobic fusogenic peptides or fusion peptides (FPs) for membrane insertion. The N-terminus of S2 subunit of SARS-CoV reported to be active in cell fusion whereby FPs have been identified. Atomic-resolution structure of FPs derived either in model membranes or in membrane mimic environment would glean insights toward viral cell fusion mechanism. Here, we have solved 3D structure, dynamics and micelle localization of a 64-residue long fusion peptide or LFP in DPC detergent micelles by NMR methods. Micelle bound structure of LFP is elucidated by the presence of discretely folded helical and intervening loops. The C-terminus region, residues F42-Y62, displays a long hydrophobic helix, whereas the N-terminus is defined by a short amphipathic helix, residues R4-Q12. The intervening residues of LFP assume stretches of loops and helical turns. The N-terminal helix is sustained by close aromatic and aliphatic sidechain packing interactions at the non-polar face. (15)N{(1)H}NOE studies indicated dynamical motion, at ps-ns timescale, of the helices of LFP in DPC micelles. PRE NMR showed that insertion of several regions of LFP into DPC micelle core.

The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes.

The most relevant articles to the scope of this review were analyzed. RESULTS: Currently there are two main definitions for bronchiolitis which are not identical, the European definition and the American one. The most common viral pathogen that causes bronchiolitis is respiratory syncytial virus which was identified in 1955; now many other viruses have been implicated in the etiology of bronchiolitis such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus. Several studies have attempted to investigate the correlation of bronchiolitis severity with the type of detected virus or viruses. However, the results were not consitent. CONCLUSIONS: For the time being, the diagnosis of bronchiolitis remains clinical.

This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1(st) to February 5(th). The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P\u003C0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P\u003C0.05). After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P\u003C0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer. CONCLUSION: Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mo, Pingzheng; Xing, Yuanyuan; Xiao, Yu; Deng, Liping; Zhao, Qiu; Wang, Hongling; Xiong, Yong; Cheng, Zhenshun; Gao, Shicheng; Liang, Ke; Luo, Mingqi; Chen, Tielong; Song, Shihui; Ma, Zhiyong; Chen, Xiaoping; Zheng, Ruiying; Cao, Qian; Wang, Fan; Zhang, Yongxi","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19aae9da84740cdf1c0a7e8c68c865cb6aedf386.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32173725/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa270","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["refractory COVID","refractory patients","general COVID","confirmed COVID","admission","consecutive patients","characteristics of patients","lower incidence of fever","fever cases","male sex","higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia","higher incidence of breath shortness","higher levels of maximum temperature","lower levels of platelets","mechanical ventilation","manifestations of anorexia","expectorant","oxygen","clinical efficacy","hospitalization","groups","high levels of neutrophil","adjunctive treatment","adjunctive agents","infected pneumonia","poor efficacy","severer disease assessment","factors of disease severity","retrospective single-center study","Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University","corticosteroid","antiviral drugs","aspartate aminotransferase","C-reactive protein","underlying comorbidities","AST","LDH","albumin","lactate dehydrogenase","pleural effusion","older age","immune enhancer","radiological remission","SARS-CoV","days","novel coronavirus","ICU transfer","difference","METHODS","RESULTS","adjustment","BACKGROUND","China","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

One such measure was a \u2018total lockdown\u2019 for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government\u0027s impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nadkarni, Abhijit; Kapoor, Arjun; Pathare, Soumitra","journal":"International Journal of Law and Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daed398d3e86bbc449e5c8b587a8b12f287550ae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160252720300388?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160252720300388","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["State"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alcohol consumption","alcohol dependence","sale of alcohol","alcohol problems","unavailability of alcohol","non-consumable alcohol","fatal alcohol withdrawal","black marketing of alcohol","consequent acute non-availability of alcohol","health dilemmas","pandemic","health systems","health emergency","people","continued access","restriction of access","grounds of public health","total lockdown","rights-related dilemmas","consumption of illicit","jurisdiction of states","appropriate services","innovative measures","Central government\u0027s impinging","State Governments of India","withdrawals","risky situations","extreme cases suicide","alleged frustration","constitutionality","social dimensions","capacity","utilitarian approach","risk of relapses","individual autonomy","physical distancing norms necessary","loss of control","world","recovery","isolation","guise","unbiased decisions","unexpected outcome","issue","tele-counselling","weeks","response","COVID","countries","revenue","associated industries","virus","Abstract","spread","curve","country","way"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that diabetic subjects are more susceptible to these conditions. However, the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV has not been systematically described. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV and compare its frequency in the two viral conditions. Meta-analysis for the proportions of subjects with diabetes was carried out in 29 studies for H1N1 (n=92,948) and 9 for MERS-CoV (n=308). Average age of H1N1 patients (36.2\u00B16.0 years) was significantly younger than that of subjects with MERS-CoV (54.3\u00B17.4 years, P\u003C0.05). Compared to MERS-CoV patients, subjects with H1N1 exhibited 3-fold lower frequency of cardiovascular diseases and 2- and 4-fold higher prevalence of obesity and immunosuppression, respectively. The overall prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 was 14.6% (95% CI: 12.3-17.0%; P\u003C0.001), a 3.6-fold lower than in MERS-CoV (54.4%; 95% CI: 29.4-79.5; P\u003C0.001). The prevalence of diabetes among H1N1 cases from Asia and North America was ~two-fold higher than those from South America and Europe. The prevalence of diabetes in MERS-CoV cases is higher than in H1N1. Regional comparisons suggest that an etiologic role of diabetes in MERS-CoV may exist distinctive from that in H1N1.","publish_time":"2016-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Badawi, Alaa; Ryoo, Seung Gwan","journal":"J Public Health Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49a7701b214e24e40679127c598881fa579f97dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5206772.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2016.733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28083520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Asia","North America","South America","Europe"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV cases","MERS-CoV patients","H1N1 cases","overall prevalence of diabetes","Average age of H1N1 patients","higher prevalence of obesity","etiologic role of diabetes","diabetic subjects","proportions of subjects","years","CI","meta-analysis of published reports","North America","South America","lower frequency of cardiovascular diseases","viral conditions","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","number of severe acute respiratory infection outbreaks","systematic review","decades","Asia","considerable global public health threat","study","Regional comparisons","Epidemiologic evidence","influenza","immunosuppression","studies","Europe","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, little information is available regarding RSV infections in Latin American countries, particularly among adult patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of RSV infection and to analyze the factors associated with severe infections in children and adults in Mexico. METHODS: Patients \u22651 month old, who presented with an influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) to six hospitals in Mexico, were eligible for participation in the study. Multiplex reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal swabs from 5629 episodes of ILI. Patients in whom RSV was detected were included in this report. RESULTS: Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 399 children and 171 adults. RSV A was detected in 413 cases and RSV B in 163, including six patients who had coinfection with both subtypes; 414 (72.6%) patients required hospital admission, including 96 (16.8%) patients that required admission to the intensive care unit. Coinfection with one or more respiratory pathogens other than RSV was detected in 159 cases. Young age (in children) and older age (in adults) as well as the presence of some underlying conditions were associated with more severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in children in Mexico. In addition, a substantial number of cases in adults were also detected highlighting the relevance of this virus in all ages. It is important to identify subjects at high risk of complications who may benefit from current or future preventive interventions.","publish_time":"2016-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gami\u00F1o\u2010Arroyo, Ana E.; Moreno\u2010Espinosa, Sarbelio; Llamosas\u2010Gallardo, Beatriz; Ortiz\u2010Hern\u00E1ndez, Ana A.; Guerrero, M.

The scoring functionality that evaluates the fitness of the docking result is one of the major challenges in virtual screening. In general, scoring functionality in docking requires a large amount of floating-point calculations, which usually takes several weeks or even months to be finished. This time-consuming procedure is unacceptable, especially when highly fatal and infectious virus arises such as SARS and H1N1, which forces the scoring task to be done in a limited time. This paper presents how to leverage the computational power of GPU to accelerate Dock6\u2019s (http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/DOCK_6/) Amber (J. Comput.

We also discuss many factors that will greatly influence the performance after porting the Amber scoring to GPU, including thread management, data transfer, and divergence hidden. Our experiments show that the GPU-accelerated Amber scoring achieves a 6.5\u00D7 speedup with respect to the original version running on AMD dual-core CPU for the same problem size.

We suggest a closed-format intensive care unit (ICU) with dedicated physicians and nurses, specifically trained in intensive care medicine whenever feasible. Regarding infrastructural components, a reliable electricity supply is essential, with adequate backup systems. Facilities for oxygen therapy are crucial, and the choice between oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and a centralized system depends on the setting. For use in mechanical ventilators, a centralized piped system is preferred. Facilities for proper hand hygiene are essential. Alcohol-based solutions are preferred, except in the context of Ebola virus disease (chloride-based solutions) and Clostridium difficile infection (soap and water). Availability of disposable gloves is important for self-protection; for invasive procedures masks, caps, sterile gowns, sterile drapes, and sterile gloves are recommended. Caring for patients with highly contagious infectious diseases requires access to personal protective equipment. Basic ICU equipment should include vital signs monitors and mechanical ventilators, which should also deliver noninvasive ventilator modes. We suggest that ICUs providing invasive ventilatory support have the ability to measure end-tidal carbon dioxide and if possible can perform blood gas analysis. We recommend availability of glucometers and capabilities for measuring blood lactate. We suggest implementation of bedside ultrasound as diagnostic tool. Finally, we recommend proper administration of patient data; suggest development of locally applicable bundles, protocols, and checklists for the management of sepsis; and implement systematic collection of quality and performance indicators to guide improvements in ICU performance.","publish_time":"2019-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papali, Alfred; Adhikari, Neill K.

Impact of a viral respiratory epidemic on the practice of medicine and rehabilitation: severe acute respiratory syndrome. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1365\u201370. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory viral epidemic that originated in China but has affected many parts of the world, with devastating impact on economies and the practice of medicine and rehabilitation. A novel coronavirus has been implicated, with transmission through respiratory droplets. Rehabilitation was significantly affected by SARS, because strict infection control measures run counter to principles such as multidisciplinary interactions, patients encouraging and learning from each other, and close physical contact during therapy. Immunocompromised patients who may silently carry SARS are common in rehabilitation and include those with renal failure, diabetes, and cancer. Routine procedures such as management of feces and respiratory secretions (eg, airway suctioning, tracheotomy care) have been classified as high risk. Personal protection equipment presented not only a physical but also a psychologic barrier to therapeutic human contact. Visitor restriction to decrease chances of disease transmission are particularly difficult for long-staying rehabilitation patients. At the height of the epidemic, curtailment of patient movement stopped all transfers for rehabilitation, and physiatrists had to function as general internists. Our experiences strongly suggest that rehabilitation institutions should have emergency preparedness plans because such epidemics may recur, whether as a result of nature or of bioterrorism.","publish_time":"2004-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Peter A; Ng, Yee Sien; Tay, Boon Keng","journal":"Arch Phys Med Rehabil","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lim PA","Ng YS"],"organizations":["Tay BK","Arch Phys Med Rehabil","SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["rehabilitation patients","rehabilitation institutions","viral respiratory epidemic","respiratory secretions","respiratory droplets","SARS","new respiratory viral epidemic","severe acute respiratory syndrome","practice of medicine","Immunocompromised patients","close physical contact","devastating impact","chances of disease transmission","therapeutic human contact","counter","principles","Tay","strict infection control measures","Ng YS","multidisciplinary interactions","psychologic barrier","management of feces","airway suctioning","emergency preparedness plans","transfers","learning","economies","curtailment of patient movement","Lim PA","world","physiatrists","renal failure","China","tracheotomy care","Visitor restriction","Arch Phys Med Rehabil","diabetes","cancer","Routine procedures","parts","epidemics","therapy","Personal protection equipment","result of nature","bioterrorism","general internists","height","experiences","high risk","novel coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

Morphological findings showed that the oleic acid group demonstrated a marked lung injury represented by prominent atelectasis, intraalveolar and interstitial patchy hemorrhage, edema, thickened alveolar septum, formation of hyaline membranes and the existence of inflammatory cells in alveolar spaces. While in the oxymatrine/dexamethasone group, these changes were less severe and in the vicinity of the control group. Furthermore, pretreatment with oxymatrine significantly alleviated oleic acid-induced lung injury accompanied by reduction of lung index and wet-to-dry weight ratio, decreases in serum TNF-\u03B1 level and inhibition of phosphorylated p38 MAPK.

The association between exposure to volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, house dust mite, molds and bacteria in day care centers (DCC) is not completely clear. The aim of this project was to study these effects. METHODS \u2013 STUDY DESIGN: This study comprised two phases. Phase I included an evaluation of 45 DCCs (25 from Lisbon and 20 from Oporto, targeting 5161 children). In this phase, building characteristics, indoor CO(2) and air temperature/relative humidity, were assessed. A children\u0027s respiratory health questionnaire derived from the ISAAC (International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Children) was also distributed. Phase II encompassed two evaluations and included 20 DCCs selected from phase I after a cluster analysis (11 from Lisbon and 9 from Oporto, targeting 2287 children). In this phase, data on ventilation, IAQ, thermal comfort parameters, respiratory and allergic health, airway inflammation biomarkers, respiratory virus infection patterns and parental and child stress were collected. RESULTS: In Phase I, building characteristics, occupant behavior and ventilation surrogates were collected from all DCCs. The response rate of the questionnaire was 61.7% (3186 children).

The aim of this study was to describe in-hospital outcomes of custom-made fenestrated stent grafts (CMSGs) and PMSGs for the treatment of CAAAs and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, all consecutives patients with CAAAs or TAAAs undergoing endovascular repair using Zenith CMSGs (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) or PMSGs between January 2012 and November 2017 were included. End points were intraoperative adverse events, in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, reinterventions, target vessel patency, and endoleaks. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included (CMSGs, n = 69; PMSGs, n = 28). The PMSG group included more patients assigned to American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (n = 14 [50%] vs n = 16 [23%]; P = .006) and more TAAAs (n = 17 [61%] vs n = 10 [15%]; P \u003C .0001). Intraoperative adverse events were recorded in eight (11%) patients in the CMSG group vs six (21%) patients in the PMSG group. No intraoperative death or open conversion occurred. In-hospital mortality rates were of 4% (n = 3) in the CMSG group and 14% in the PMSG group (n = 4). Chronic renal failure was an independent preoperative risk factor of postoperative death or complications (odds ratio, 4.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-14.43; P = .004). Rates of postoperative complications were 22% (n = 15) and 25% (n = 7) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Spinal cord ischemia rates were 4% (n = 3) and 7% (n = 2) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Reintervention rates were 16% (n = 11) in the CMSG group and 32% (n = 9) in the PMSG group. At discharge, target vessel patency rate in CMSGs was 98% (n = 207/210). All target vessels (n = 98) were patent in the PMSG group. Endoleaks at discharge were observed in 24% of the CMSG group (n = 16) vs 8% of the PMSG group (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed clinically relevant differences of several important in-hospital outcomes in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Larger cohorts and longer follow-up are needed to allow direct comparison. PMSGs may offer acceptable in-hospital results in patients requiring urgent interventions when CMSGs are not available or possible.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00E9n\u00E9maud, Jean Nicolas; Ben Abdallah, Iannis; de Boissieu, Paul; Touma, Joseph; Kobeiter, Hicham; Desgranges, Pascal; Becquemin, Jean-Pierre; Cochennec, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric","journal":"J Vasc Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/435787d62f0e10590203ffc1376522b361c7ac3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126501.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzgzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Zenith","Cook Medical","PMSG","CMSG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vs n","CMSG group vs","PMSG groups","PMSGs","hospital mortality rates","hospital results","consecutives patients","Rates of postoperative complications","Zenith CMSGs","TAAAs","treatment of CAAAs","intraoperative death","Reintervention rates","hospital outcomes of custom-made fenestrated stent grafts","intraoperative adverse events","target vessel patency rate","retrospective study","target vessels","discharge","endoleaks","Spinal cord ischemia rates","thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms","independent preoperative risk factor of postoperative death","semiurgent treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms","urgent interventions","reinterventions","endovascular repair","useful option","Chronic renal failure","Bloomington","American Society of Anesthesiologists class","longer follow-up","single-center","odds ratio","relevant differences","Physician","End points","Larger cohorts","OBJECTIVE","open conversion","patent","direct comparison","METHODS","confidence interval","CONCLUSIONS","aim"],"language":"en"},

E. coli isolates were examined for virulence genes (f5, f41, f17, sta, stb, lt, eae, vt) using PCR and the prevalence of E. coli virulence profiles was spatially described in terms of spatial distribution. A total of 30.1 % isolates were found to be positive for at least one of the virulence genes. Depending on the different gene combinations present, 11 virulence profiles were found. Most of the isolates analyzed had a single gene, and no combination of fimbrial and enterotoxin gene was predominant. There was no association between the frequency and distribution of E. coli virulence genes and calf health status. Most of the virulence profiles were compatible with ETEC strains and showed a homogeneous distribution over the sampled area. A clustering pattern for E. coli virulence profiles could not be recognized.

The full-length genomes, representing VEE virus antigenic subtypes I\u2013VI, range in size from 11.3 to 11.5 kilobases, with 48\u201353% overall G\u002BC contents. Size disparities result from subtype-related differences in the number and length of direct repeats in the C-terminal nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) domain coding sequence and the 3\u2032NTR, while G\u002BC content disparities are attributable to strain-specific variations in base composition at the wobble position of the polyprotein codons. Highly-conserved protein components and one nonconserved protein domain constitute the VEE virus replicase polyproteins. Approximately 80% of deduced nsP1 and nsP4 amino acid residues are invariant, compared to less than 20% of C-terminal nsP3 domain residues. In two enzootic strains, C-terminal nsP3 domain sequences degenerate into little more than repetitive serine-rich blocks. Nonstructural region sequence information drawn from a cross-section of VEE virus subtypes clarifies features of alphavirus conserved sequence elements and proteinase recognition signals. As well, whole-genome comparative analysis supports the reclassification of VEE subtype-variety IF and subtype II viruses.","publish_time":"1999-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meissner, John D.; Huang, Claire Y.-H.; Pfeffer, Martin; Kinney, Richard M.","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126981.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["G C","VEE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C-terminal nsP3 domain sequences","C-terminal nonstructural protein","virus strains","C-terminal nsP3 domain residues","cross-section of VEE virus subtypes","VEE virus antigenic subtypes","C contents","VEE virus replicase polyproteins","nonconserved protein domain","domain coding sequence","C content disparities","reclassification of VEE subtype-variety","nonstructural region nucleotide sequences","enzootic strains","Nonstructural region sequence information","conserved protein components","prototype strains","Size disparities","nontranslated region","genomic RNA sequences","subtype-related differences","features of alphavirus conserved sequence elements","overall G","enzootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis","nsP4 amino acid residues","number","proteinase recognition signals","wobble position","length of direct repeats","base composition","specific variations","deduced nsP1","full-length genomes","repetitive serine-rich blocks","genome comparative analysis","polyprotein codons","range","viruses","kilobases"],"language":"en"},

Live Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells in contact with fresh TiO(2) were found deformed and dead after 15 min contact. The cause of germicidal activity was discussed from the observed cell deformation, lysis and increased absorption at 1680 cm(\u22121) in FT-IR spectra of the affected cells, which proved the oxidizing effect of fresh TiO(2) to cells. The deformation caused by the stretching of cell wall and pressure built-up inside the cell, led to cell burst and release of intracellular materials. The degree of cell deformation was found positively related with the wetting property of TiO(2). Cells are negatively charged, for Gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than Gram-positive cells. The germicidal effect of TiO(2) gradually decreased after exposure to air at room temperature, as the wetting property decreased. This kind of germicidal activity was more effective compared to other germicidal process such as UVA/TiO(2) or Ag(\u002B).

They provide more rapid and sensitive testing that impacts directly on clinical management of infected patients. Molecular diagnostic tests arose from the need to detect micro-organisms that are slow or difficult to grow, or that are present in only small numbers. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g. polymerase chain reaction, PCR) can detect DNA or RNA specific to certain micro-organisms and do not rely on either the recovery of the pathogen or an immune response in the infected patient. Alternative nucleic acid amplification methods have emerged recently because of increasing commercial interest in infectious disease diagnostics and the comprehensive patient protection of PCR technology. Such techniques are gaining widespread acceptance, and have displaced more conventional gold-standard testing in some areas of infectious disease (e.g. viral load testing in HIV-1 infected patients, diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection). Genetic characterization techniques are increasingly used to determine the relatedness of micro-organisms in the clinical setting. These methods are useful in establishing routes or sources of infection in outbreaks of disease, and are powerful epidemiological tools in large-scale clinical investigations. Recently, there has been a move towards pathogen characterization techniques based on direct nucleotide sequencing (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, multi-locus sequence typing). These techniques offer unambiguous, portable data that can be exchanged via the Internet, strengthening collaborative efforts in the field of infectious disease research.","publish_time":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fawley, Warren N; Wilcox, Mark H","journal":"Medicine (Abingdon)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogen characterization techniques","Molecular diagnostic techniques","Nucleic acid amplification techniques","Genetic characterization techniques","infectious disease diagnostics","areas of infectious disease","outbreaks of disease","clinical management of infected patients","clinical setting","clinical microbiology","field of infectious disease research","sensitive testing","large-scale clinical investigations","certain micro-organisms","relatedness of micro-organisms","Alternative nucleic acid amplification methods","viral load testing","Molecular diagnostic tests","conventional gold-standard testing","sources of infection","comprehensive patient protection of PCR technology","direct nucleotide sequencing","single nucleotide polymorphism analysis","diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection","powerful epidemiological tools","polymerase chain reaction","DNA","HIV","multi-locus sequence","routes","need","RNA specific","collaborative efforts","immune response","portable data","widespread acceptance","small numbers","Internet","recovery"],"language":"en"},

A focal skin puncture and subcutaneous swelling over the dorsal part of the head were detected on physical examination. Neurological examination indicated lesion(s) in the right forebrain in four cats, multifocal forebrain in one cat, left forebrain in one cat, and multifocal forebrain and brainstem in the remaining cat. In all cats, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying forebrain lesion causing a severe mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma. CLINICAL APPROACH AND OUTCOME: All cats were managed with a combination of medical and surgical treatment. At surgery a small penetrating calvarial fracture was detected in all cats, and a tooth fragment was found within the content of the abscess in two cats. The combination of surgical intervention, intensive care and intravenous antimicrobials led to a return to normal neurological function in five cats. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: As this series of cases indicates, successful resolution of a brain abscess due to a bite injury depends on early recognition and combined used of antimicrobials and surgical intervention. A particular aim of surgery is to remove any skull and foreign body (tooth) fragments that may represent a continuing focus of infection.","publish_time":"2011-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costanzo, Chiara; Garosi, Laurent S.; Glass, Eric N.; Rusbridge, Clare; Stalin, Catherine E.; Volk, Holger A.","journal":"J Feline Med Surg","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzIxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["forebrain lesion","multifocal forebrain","right forebrain","left forebrain","adult domestic shorthair cats","Neurological examination","combination of surgical intervention","LESION LOCALISATION","remaining cat","surgical treatment","abscess","normal neurological function","intravenous antimicrobials","combination of medical","tooth fragment","physical examination","day history of progressive neurological signs","adjacent brain parenchyma","particular aim of surgery","severe mass effect","intensive care","subcutaneous swelling","fragments","return","space","brainstem","series of cases","small penetrating calvarial fracture","focal skin puncture","magnetic resonance imaging","bite injury","successful resolution","foreign body","early recognition","skull","content","head","PRESENTATION","CLINICAL APPROACH","OUTCOME","continuing focus of infection","PRACTICAL RELEVANCE"],"language":"en"},

No evidence for this mechanism has been reported thus far. This study aimed to look for enterotoxic effect elaborated by Cryptosporidium. METHODS: The effects on human intestinal transport of stool supernatant of diarrheal calves infected with Cryptosporidium parvum were examined. Aliquots of centrifuged and filtered stools were added to the mucosal or serosal side of human jejunum obtained from patients undergoing surgery and mounted in Ussing chambers. Electrical parameters were recorded. Stool supernatants of uninfected calves served as a control. RESULTS: The mucosal addition of 2.5 mg protein of fecal supernatant from diarrheal calves induced a prompt and significant increase in short circuit current with no effects on tissue conductance. The serosal addition of this material and the addition of control supernatant to either side did not induce modifications of electrical parameters. The enterotoxic effect was dose-dependent and saturable. It was reversible by withdrawing the supernatant from the incubation medium. The electrical effect was chloride- and calcium-dependent and was sensitive to heating. CONCLUSIONS: An enterotoxic activity is present in the stools of Cryptosporidium-infected calves. This activity may be responsible for secretory diarrhea in humans.","publish_time":"2016-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guarino, Alfredo; Canani, Roberto Berni; Pozio, Edoardo; Terracciano, Luigi; Albano, Fabio; Mazzeo, Mario","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzI3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enterotoxic effect","addition of control supernatant","enterotoxic activity","enterotoxic mechanism","electrical effect","stools of Cryptosporidium","mucosal addition","serosal addition","human intestinal transport of stool supernatant of diarrheal calves","effects","protein of fecal supernatant","Stool supernatants of uninfected calves","Cryptosporidium parvum","modifications of electrical parameters","human jejunum","filtered stools","secretory diarrhea","calcium-dependent","dose-dependent","clinical pattern of cryptosporidial diarrhea","prompt","short circuit current","significant increase","surgery","material","AIMS","patients","chloride","tissue conductance","BACKGROUND","humans","Aliquots of centrifuged","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Ussing chambers","heating","incubation medium","RESULTS","study","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Vaccinia-mediated expression can be used for assessing cellular localization, posttranslational modifications, oligomerization, and transport and turnover rates. The system provides a rapid method for screening mutant proteins for expression and targeting. It is an excellent way of quickly deciding which mutant proteins might be worth further studying using stable expression systems. Expression of foreign genes using Vaccinia virus is based on recombinant viruses constructed by insertion of complementary DNA (cDNA) into the nonessential thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Both direct and indirect methods of expression are possible. The foreign gene can be inserted into the vaccinia genome by homologous recombination using a plasmid with flanking regions of vaccinia DNA. The recombinant virus is selected, expanded, and used to infect cells, which then express high levels of the foreign protein. Recombinant vaccinia viruses are generated by subcloning the foreign gene into a plasmid transfer vector so it is flanked by DNA from the vaccinia (TK) gene, which is nonessential for growth of the virus in tissue culture. This plasmid is then transfected into vaccinia-infected cells. Homologous recombination of the plasmid and the vaccinia genome generates a recombinant virus with an inactive TK gene.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weisz, Ora A.; Machamer, Carolyn E.","journal":"Methods Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzI4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant vaccinia expression systems","vaccinia genome","Recombinant vaccinia viruses","Vaccinia-mediated expression","vaccinia-infected cells","Expression of foreign genes","recombinant viruses","flanking regions of vaccinia DNA","stable expression systems","inactive TK gene","indirect methods of expression","foreign protein","plasmid transfer vector","homologous recombination","screening mutant proteins","insertion of complementary DNA","nonessential thymidine kinase","oligomerization","cDNA","studying","subcloning","rapid method","transport","posttranslational modifications","growth","cellular localization","high levels","cell biologists","advantages","turnover rates","tissue culture","excellent way","limitations","chapter"],"language":"en"},

We therefore conclude that protein \u03C31 is a homotrimer and provide, with supportive experimental evidence, a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the oligomeric protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which, coupled with chemical cross-linking studies, has in part led to the previous suggestion that \u03C31 might be a higher order oligomer.","publish_time":"2006-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strong, James E.; Leone, Gustavo; Duncan, Roy; Sharma, Rajendra K.; Lee, Patrick W.K.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["native protein","monomeric molecular weight","oligomeric protein bands","protein product designated B","reovirus cell attachment protein \u03C31","molecular weights","Biophysical characterization of purified \u03C31","asymmetric shape of \u03C31","monomeric subunits","C-terminal truncated","Similar biophysical analysis","biophysical means","C-terminal globular head","SDS-polyacrylamide gels","N-terminal fibrous tail","SDS-PAGE","identification of oligomeric forms of \u03C3l","sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis","reovirus Sl mRNA transcripts synthesizedin vitro","sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","serotype","column filtration","products","tryptic fragments","rationale","anomalous behavior","oligomerization state","supportive experimental evidence","rabbit reticulocyte lysate","homotrimer","higher order oligomer","conditions","total","previous suggestion","chemical cross-linking studies","B3","trimers"],"language":"en"},

Microbes from manure are often low on the priority list for control and remediation, despite the fact that several out-breaks of gastroenteritis have been traced to livestock operations. The pathogens discussed in this paper include protozoans (Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia spp.), bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), and some enteric viruses. Clinical symptoms, prospects for zoonotic infection, and control methods other than the use of antimicrobials are considered. Recommendations to avoid disease transmission include taking steps to ensure the provision of clean, unstressful environments to reduce disease susceptibility and the careful handling and spreading of manure from animals at high risk for infection, especially young calves. Composting and drying of manure decrease the number of viable pathogens. Environmental controls, such as filter strips, also reduce the risk of water contamination.","publish_time":"2010-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pell, Alice N.","journal":"J Dairy Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["manure","water quality","risk of water contamination","zoonotic infection","control methods","high risk","disease susceptibility","disease transmission","air quality","environmental concerns","Environmental controls","number of viable pathogens","Escherichia coli O157","Salmonella","bacteria","H7","Listeria monocytogenes","Giardia","protozoans","unstressful environments","prospects","odor problems","animals","Cryptosporidium parvum","provision of clean","priority list","careful handling","Mycobacterium paratuberculosis","steps","paper","remediation","Clinical symptoms","filter strips","waste management","young calves","effects of nutrients","fact","breaks of gastroenteritis","enteric viruses"],"language":"en"},

While the detailed mechanisms remain unclear for most animal viruses, a general theme is apparent like other stages in the replication cycle; their entry depends on the activities of the host cell. In order to take up nutrients, to communicate with other cells, to control the intracellular ion balance, and to secrete substances, cells have a variety of mechanisms for bypassing and modifying the barrier properties imposed by their plasma membrane.

Fusion proteins from several different virus families, including Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Retroviridae, and Filoviridae have been shown to exhibit striking structural similarities; they all use a common mechanism for inducing membrane fusion, and the same general model applies to all of these cases. The flavivirus genome is a positive-stranded RNA molecule consisting of a single, long open reading frame of more than 10,000 nucleotides flanked by noncoding regions at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. The fusion properties of flaviviruses have been investigated using several different assay systems, including virus-induced cell\u2013cell fusion and virus\u2013liposome fusion.

In RNA viruses\u0027 genetic recombination is defined as any process leading to the exchange of information between viral RNAs. There are two types of recombination events: legitimate and illegitimate. While legitimate (homologous) recombination occurs between closely related sequences at corresponding positions, illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombination could happen at any position among the unrelated RNA molecules. In order to differentiate between the symmetrical and asymmetrical homologous crosses, Lai defined the former as homologous recombination and the latter as aberrant homologous recombination. This chapter uses brome mosaic virus (BMV), a multicomponent plant RNA virus, as an example to discuss the progress in studying the mechanism of genetic recombination in positive-stranded RNA viruses. Studies described in this chapter summarize the molecular approaches used to increase the frequency of recombination among BMV RNA segments and, more importantly, to target the sites of crossovers to specific BMV RNA regions. It demonstrates that the latter can be accomplished by introducing local complementarities to the recombining substrates.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bujarski, Jozef J.; Nagy, Peter D.; Flasinski, Stanislaw","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131656/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQ5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lai"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frequency of recombination","recombination processes","aberrant homologous recombination","RNA viruses\u0027 genetic recombination","mechanism of genetic recombination","types of recombination events","BMV RNA segments","specific BMV RNA regions","unrelated RNA molecules","multicomponent plant RNA virus","positive-stranded RNA viruses","chapter","asymmetrical homologous crosses","DNA-based organisms","genomic DNA","brome mosaic virus","Lai","corresponding positions","related sequences","sites of crossovers","exchange of information","powerful source of variability","adaptation","rearrangements","example","local complementarities","recombining substrates","viral RNAs","molecular approaches","progress","order","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Rotaviruses and caliciviruses are the most frequently encountered, in close to 60 % of viral gastroenterititis. Rotaviruses account for more than 50 % of severe diseases and caliciviruses, especially norovirus are reponsible for less severe sporadic gastroenteritis and water-or food- borne epidemics. Astroviruses and adenoviruses are minority, excepted for immunocompromised patients. Viral or Bacterial and viral co- infections are frequent (up to 15 %). To date, the first rotavirus vaccine assays did not reveal any shift from a viral genus to another, such as calicivirus or adenovirns, according to the fact that epidemiologic features of these viruses are quite different. Progress in viral diagnosis and genotyping enabled to analyse viral diversity and to follow viral recombination events, and emergence of new variants that could propagate among various countries. This dynamic evolution that concerns not only Europe but also developing countries should be carefully surveyed at the era of rotavirus vaccination.","publish_time":"2007-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alain, S.; Denis, F.","journal":"Arch Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93997d90a946c98079e8effec3cd4679edccb5fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133232/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rotaviruses"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["viral diversity","viral diagnosis","viral genus","viral gastroenterititis","viral recombination events","viral co- infections","various countries","caliciviruses","various pathogens","severe diseases","Rotaviruses account","severe sporadic gastroenteritis","rotavirus vaccine assays","era of rotavirus vaccination","norovirus","water","emergence of new variants","genotyping","minority","food","fact","shift","epidemiologic features","adenoviruses","Acute infectious diarrhoea","Europe","date","Progress","immunocompromised patients","dynamic evolution","adenovirns","Astroviruses","half cases","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

Serine peptidases are found in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. They include exopeptidases, endopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and omega peptidases. On the basis of three-dimensional structures, most of the serine peptidase families can be grouped together into about six clans that may have common ancestors. The structures are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A. The peptidases of chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have a common \u201Ccatalytic triad\u201D of three amino acids\u2014namely, serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families; however the protein folds are quite different. The arrangements of the catalytic residues in the linear sequences of members of the various families commonly reflect their relationships at the clan level. The members of the chymotrypsin family are almost entirely confined to animals. 10 families are included in chymotrypsin clan (SA), and all the active members of these families are endopeptidases. The order of catalytic residues in the polypeptide chain in clan SA is His/Asp/Ser.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rawlings, Neil D.; Barrett, Alan J.","journal":"Methods Enzymol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133253/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["families of serine peptidases","peptidases of chymotrypsin","serine peptidase families","chymotrypsin clan","various families","chymotrypsin family","clan SA","omega peptidases","active members","carboxypeptidase C clans","D-Ala peptidase","subtilisin","catalytic triad","order of catalytic residues","linear sequences of members","endopeptidases","clan level","Escherichia D-Ala","common ancestors","basis of three-dimensional structures","polypeptide chain","amino acids","electrophile","aspartate","nucleophile","oligopeptidases","viruses","relationships","protein folds","histidine","bacteria","chapter","geometric orientations","base","eukaryotes","exopeptidases","arrangements","animals"],"language":"en"},

It was found that 100% of the cells in the passaged cultures were positive for viral antigen throughout the course of the experiment.

The cytopathogenic agent in the supernatants of these cultures could be passaged repeatedly, suggesting the generation of a mutant virus. Analysis of RNA from such cultures revealed the presence of a subgenomic viral RNA of approximately 8 kilobases (kb). In all six cases, this RNA had an identical internal deletion of 4764 nucleotides, including the region coding for all structural proteins. The subgenomic RNA replicated and was packaged in the presence of wild-type virus. Cells infected with cytopathogenic virus contained increased amounts of the viral protein NS3 thought to be involved in pestivirus cytopathogenicity.","publish_time":"2003-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mittelholzer, Christian; Moser, Christian; Tratschin, Jon-Duri; Hofmann, Martin A","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133997/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytopathogenic virus","type virus","mutant virus","infected cultures","passaged cultures","recombinant virus vA187","cells","subgenomic viral RNA","separate cultures","subgenomic RNA","high titers of infectious virus","Analysis of RNA","classical swine fever virus strain Alfort","viral antigen","supernatants","biological clones","viral protein NS3","presence of wild","cytopathogenic agent","cDNA clone of Alfort","swine kidney cell lines SK","increased amounts","nucleotides","identical internal deletion","region coding","course","cytopathic effect","structural proteins","PK","passaging","kilobases","experiment","cases","generation","pestivirus cytopathogenicity"],"language":"en"},

An explicit-tacit knowledge quadrant identifies distinct ways in which knowledge is transferred and created. Empirical evidence shows that ClinMicroNet complements other resources by encouraging members to share experiences and collaborate in establishing the best practices.

During this process, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the template to another, during either plus or minus strand synthesis, to yield subgenomic RNA molecules. Central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present at both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer. Here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus TRSs, demonstrating that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader TRS and antisense body TRS, but also on the primary sequence of the body TRS. While the leader TRS merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the body TRS fulfils multiple functions.

During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection. METHODS: HLA-class I and II allele typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus. An additional control set of 190 normal healthy unrelated Taiwanese was also used in the analysis. RESULTS: Woolf and Haldane Odds ratio (OR) and corrected P-value (Pc) obtained from two tails Fisher exact test were used to show susceptibility of HLA class I or class II alleles with coronavirus infection. At first, when analyzing infected SARS patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a \u0022severe cases\u0022 patient group from the infected \u0022probable SARS\u0022 patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc = 0.0279). CONCLUSIONS: Densely populated regions with genetically related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population, have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the \u0022Probable SARS infected\u0022 patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the \u0022Severe cases\u0022 patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations.

SARS case fatality has varied across geographical areas, which might be partially explained by air pollution level. METHODS: Publicly accessible data on SARS morbidity and mortality were utilized in the data analysis. Air pollution was evaluated by air pollution index (API) derived from the concentrations of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ground-level ozone. Ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the association and correlation between air pollution and SARS case fatality via model fitting. Partially ecologic studies were performed to assess the effects of long-term and short-term exposures on the risk of dying from SARS. RESULTS: Ecologic analysis conducted among 5 regions with 100 or more SARS cases showed that case fatality rate increased with the increment of API (case fatality = - 0.063 \u002B 0.001 * API). Partially ecologic study based on short-term exposure demonstrated that SARS patients from regions with moderate APIs had an 84% increased risk of dying from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.41\u20132.40). Similarly, SARS patients from regions with high APIs were twice as likely to die from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs. (RR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.31\u20133.65). Partially ecologic analysis based on long-term exposure to ambient air pollution showed the similar association. CONCLUSION: Our studies demonstrated a positive association between air pollution and SARS case fatality in Chinese population by utilizing publicly accessible data on SARS statistics and air pollution indices. Although ecologic fallacy and uncontrolled confounding effect might have biased the results, the possibility of a detrimental effect of air pollution on the prognosis of SARS patients deserves further investigation.","publish_time":"2003-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Yan; Zhang, Zuo-Feng; Froines, John; Zhao, Jinkou; Wang, Hua; Yu, Shun-Zhang; Detels, Roger","journal":"Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75ebad1e8641e5fe2a51214f4d97742ab59a8dae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC293432.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC293432/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["SARS"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS case fatality","SARS cases","SARS statistics","SARS morbidity","air pollution level","ambient air pollution","air pollution indices","air pollution index","prognosis of SARS patients","regions","Ecologic analysis","detrimental effect of air pollution","ecologic studies","case fatality rate","data analysis","ecologic fallacy","ecologic study","low APIs","accessible data","high APIs","moderate APIs","long-term exposure","positive association","similar association","increment of API","RESULTS","increased risk","nitrogen dioxide","sulfur dioxide","effects of long-term","probable cases","short-term exposures","uncontrolled confounding effect","ground-level ozone","carbon monoxide","Chinese population","mortality","concentrations of particulate matter","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","correlation","model fitting","BACKGROUND","possibility","geographical areas","mainland China","lives","investigation","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Based on insertions and deletions and dissimilarity due to SNPs, the dataset of all the isolates has been qualitatively classified into three groups each having their own subgroups. These are the A-group with \u0022regular\u0022 isolates (no insertions / deletions except for 5\u0027 and 3\u0027 ends), the B-group of isolates with \u0022long insertions\u0022, and the C-group of isolates with \u0022many individual\u0022 insertions and deletions. The isolate with the smallest average number of SNPs, compared to other isolates, has been identified (TWH). The density distribution of SNPs, insertions and deletions for each group or subgroup, as well as cumulatively for all the isolates is also presented, along with the gene map for TWH. Since individual SNPs may have occurred at random, positions corresponding to multiple SNPs (occurring in two or more isolates) are identified and presented. This result revises some previous results of a similar type. Amino acid changes caused by multiple SNPs are also identified (for the annotated sequences, as well as presupposed amino acid changes for non-annotated ones). Exact SNP positions for the isolates in each group or subgroup are presented. Finally, a phylogenetic tree for the SARS-CoV isolates has been produced using the CLUSTALW program, showing high compatibility with former qualitative classification. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative study of SARS-CoV isolates provides essential information for genome polymorphism, indication of strain differences and variants evolution. It may help with the development of effective treatment.","publish_time":"2004-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pavlovi\u0107-La\u017Eeti\u0107, Gordana M; Miti\u0107, Nenad S; Beljanski, Milo\u0161 V","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52ce19fe79de46d9bb0fa7e75a0631fed2d3efd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC434493.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC434493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TWH","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV isolates","deletions","positions of SNPs","multiple SNPs","individual SNPs","long insertions","C-group","B-group","genome polymorphism","SARS-CoV complete genome","density distribution of SNPs","positions of single nucleotide polymorphism","smallest average number of SNPs","phylogeny of SARS","nucleotide sequences","Exact SNP positions","comparative study of SARS","annotated sequences","nucleotide structure","TWH","presupposed amino acid changes","previous results","non-annotated ones","essential information","indication of strain differences","high compatibility","variants evolution","dissimilarity","CLUSTALW program","phylogenetic tree","qualitative classification","similar type","CONCLUSIONS","dataset","development of effective treatment","sequence similarity","gene map","ends","comparison","main goal","subgroups","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Parameters studied included serum levels of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody, tests of lung function, and imaging data to evaluate changes in lung fibrosis. In addition, we explored the incidence of femoral head necrosis in some of the individuals recovering from SARS. METHODS: The subjects of this study were 383 clinically diagnosed SARS patients in Beijing, China. They were tested regularly for serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody and lung function and were given chest X-rays and/or high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) examinations at the Chinese PLA General Hospital during the 12 months that followed their release from the hospital. Those individuals who were found to have lung diffusion abnormities (transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide [D(L)CO] \u003C 80% of predicted value [pred]) received regular lung function tests and HRCT examinations in the follow-up phase in order to document the changes in their lung condition. Some patients who complained of joint pain were given magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of their femoral heads. FINDINGS: Of all the subjects, 81.2% (311 of 383 patients) tested positive for serum SARS-CoV IgG. Of those testing positive, 27.3% (85 of 311 patients) were suffering from lung diffusion abnormities (D(L)CO \u003C 80% pred) and 21.5% (67 of 311 patients) exhibited lung fibrotic changes. In the 12 month duration of this study, all of the 40 patients with lung diffusion abnormities who were examined exhibited some improvement of lung function and fibrosis detected by radiography. Of the individuals receiving MRI examinations, 23.1% (18 of 78 patients) showed signs of femoral head necrosis. INTERPRETATION: The lack of sero-positive SARS-CoV in some individuals suggests that there may have been some misdiagnosed cases among the subjects included in this study. Of those testing positive, the serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody decreased significantly during the 12 months after hospital discharge. Additionally, we found that the individuals who had lung fibrosis showed some spontaneous recovery. Finally, some of the subjects developed femoral head necrosis.","publish_time":"2005-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Lixin; Liu, Youning; Fan, Baoxing; Xiao, Yueyong; Tian, Qing; Chen, Liangan; Zhao, Hong; Chen, Weijun","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18c21db94a22f1358057c6d797164ffe1585b395.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC545044.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC545044/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","PLA General Hospital","HRCT"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","lung fibrosis","positive SARS-CoV","lung condition","tests of lung function","lung diffusion abnormities","serum SARS-CoV IgG","improvement of lung function","lung fibrotic changes","regular lung function tests","serum levels of SARS coronavirus","CoV IgG antibody","study","subjects","recovery of individuals","HRCT examinations","MRI examinations","hospital discharge","incidence of femoral head necrosis","signs of femoral head necrosis","femoral heads","months","Chinese PLA General Hospital","imaging data","spontaneous recovery","magnetic resonance imaging","transfer coefficient","high resolution computerized tomography","carbon monoxide","chest X-rays","joint pain","follow-up phase","severe acute respiratory syndrome","lack of sero","order","year","Beijing","China","Parameters","radiography","predicted value","INTERPRETATION","misdiagnosed cases","OBJECTIVE","intent","month duration","release","METHODS","addition","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

However, the immune-pathogenesis of SARS is poorly understood. To understand the host response to this pathogen, we investigated the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from SARS patients, and compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: The number of differentially expressed genes was found to be 186 under stringent filtering criteria of microarray data analysis. Several genes were highly up-regulated in patients with SARS, such as, the genes coding for Lactoferrin, S100A9 and Lipocalin 2. The real-time PCR method verified the results of the gene array analysis and showed that those genes that were up-regulated as determined by microarray analysis were also found to be comparatively up-regulated by real-time PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This differential gene expression profiling of PBMCs from patients with SARS strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response, rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection, as we observed a complete lack of cytokine genes usually triggered during a viral infection. Our study shows for the first time how the immune system responds to the SARS infection, and opens new possibilities for designing new diagnostics and treatments for this new life-threatening disease.","publish_time":"2005-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reghunathan, Renji; Jayapal, Manikandan; Hsu, Li-Yang; Chng, Hiok-Hee; Tai, Dessmon; Leung, Bernard P; Melendez, Alirio J","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72ace5af731fdf4c384e912b074193d13902b7a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC546205.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC546205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozcw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Lipocalin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS infection","response of SARS","SARS patients","viral infection","microarray analysis","genes coding","gene array analysis","specific immune response","real-time PCR analysis","new diagnostics","new possibilities","host response","new epidemic form of life-threatening infection","new life-threatening disease","immune system","RESULTS","immune-pathogenesis","innate inflammatory response","complete lack of cytokine genes","differential gene expression profiling of PBMCs","stringent filtering criteria of microarray data analysis","real-time PCR method","gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","treatments","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","BACKGROUND","Lactoferrin","S100A9","CONCLUSIONS","Lipocalin","novel coronavirus","healthy controls","number","study"],"language":"en"},

ReHAB compares results from PSI-BLAST searches performed with two versions of a protein sequence database and highlights hits that are present only in the updated database. Results are presented in an easily comprehended table, or in a BLAST-like report, using colors to highlight the new hits. ReHAB is designed to handle large numbers of query sequences, such as whole genomes or sets of genomes.

To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. RESULTS: We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN-\u03B3 synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2 or IFN-\u03B3 alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3 or IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3 inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163- and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3 was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3 (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3 synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression. We hypothesize that IFN-\u03B3 produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.","publish_time":"2005-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sainz, Bruno; LaMarca, Heather L; Garry, Robert F; Morris, Cindy A","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab1ac4f7b9c57dad5e3d61f72e8e3d552059fa09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC554982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC554982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozgz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","IFN","IE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B3 inhibited HCMV plaque formation","HCMV replication","HCMV dissemination","HCMV immediate early","observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation","innate IFNs","mRNA expression","fold","effects of IFNs","protein expression","gene expression","HFFs","HSV","vehicle-treated cells","endogenous type","human cytomegalovirus","herpes simplex virus type","pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts","genes","gamma interferon","real-time PCR analyses","Recent studies","adaptive immune response","IE2","decrease","western blotting","generation of isobole plots","IE1","regulation","mechanism","findings","synergistic interaction","herpesviruses","immunofluorescence","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","phenomenon","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: A method and SPR Opt (SNP and PCR-RFLP Optimization) software to perform a comprehensive, whole-genome analysis to forensically discriminate multiple sequences is presented. Tools for the optimization of forensic typing using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses across multiple isolate sequences of a species are described. The PCR-RFLP analysis includes prediction and selection of optimal primers and restriction enzymes to enable maximum isolate discrimination based on sequence information. SPR Opt calculates all SNP or PCR-RFLP variations present in the sequences, groups them into haplotypes according to their co-segregation across those sequences, and performs combinatoric analyses to determine which sets of haplotypes provide maximal discrimination among all the input sequences. Those set combinations requiring that membership in the fewest haplotypes be queried (i.e. the fewest assays be performed) are found. These analyses highlight variable regions based on existing sequence data. These markers may be heterogeneous among unsequenced isolates as well, and thus may be useful for characterizing the relationships among unsequenced as well as sequenced isolates. The predictions are multi-locus. Analyses of mumps and SARS viruses are summarized. Phylogenetic trees created based on SNPs, PCR-RFLPs, and full genomes are compared for SARS virus, illustrating that purported phylogenies based only on SNP or PCR-RFLP variations do not match those based on multiple sequence alignment of the full genomes. CONCLUSION: This is the first software to optimize the selection of forensic markers to maximize information gained from the fewest assays, accepting whole or partial genome sequence data as input. As more sequence data becomes available for multiple strains and isolates of a species, automated, computational approaches such as those described here will be essential to make sense of large amounts of information, and to guide and optimize efforts in the laboratory.

Persistent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) abnormalities occur in SARS patients up to 40 days after recovery. METHODS: To determine further the time course of recovery of lung inflammation, we investigated the HRCT and inflammatory profiles, and coronavirus persistence in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 12 patients at recovery at 60 and 90 days. RESULTS: At 60 days, compared to normal controls, SARS patients had increased cellularity of BALF with increased alveolar macrophages (AM) and CD8 cells. HRCT scores were increased and correlated with T-cell numbers and their subpopulations, and inversely with CD4/CD8 ratio. TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, IL-8, RANTES and MCP-1 levels were increased. Viral particles in AM were detected by electron microscopy in 7 of 12 SARS patients with high HRCT score. On day 90, HRCT scores improved significantly in 10 of 12 patients, with normalization of BALF cell counts in 6 of 12 patients with repeat bronchoscopy. Pulse steroid therapy and prolonged fever were two independent factors associated with delayed resolution of pneumonitis, in this non-randomized, retrospective analysis. CONCLUSION: Resolution of pneumonitis is delayed in some patients during SARS recovery and may be associated with delayed clearance of coronavirus, Complete resolution may occur by 90 days or later.","publish_time":"2005-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chun-Hua; Liu, Chien-Ying; Wan, Yung-Liang; Chou, Chun-Liang; Huang, Kuo-Hsiung; Lin, Horng-Chyuan; Lin, Shu-Min; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Chung, Kian Fan; Kuo, Han-Pin","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ae8479c3cef7cc97b7edb7cb3e9f86ec51d140e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1156954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1156954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzExNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HRCT","BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","SARS recovery","days","HRCT scores","increased cellularity of BALF","delayed resolution of pneumonitis","normalization of BALF cell","increased alveolar macrophages","high HRCT score","alveolar cell desquamation","Complete resolution","delayed clearance of coronavirus","CD8 cells","time course of recovery","T-cell numbers","coronavirus persistence","CD8 ratio","acute phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome","mononuclear cells infiltration","dysregulation of plasma cytokine levels","prolonged fever","independent factors","abnormalities","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","hyaline membrane formation","normal controls","lung inflammation","Persistent high-resolution computed tomography","inflammatory profiles","Pulse steroid therapy","subpopulations","retrospective analysis","CD4","RANTES","MCP","electron microscopy","TNF-\u03B1","BACKGROUND","repeat bronchoscopy","CONCLUSION","Viral particles","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

No licensed specific drugs are available to prevent their infection. Different host receptors for cellular entry, poorly conserved structural proteins (antigens), and the high mutation and recombination rates of CoVs pose a significant problem in the development of wide-spectrum anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s), which are key enzymes in viral gene expression and replication, were revealed to share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparison of four crystal structures and a homology model representing all three genetic clusters of the genus Coronavirus. This conclusion was further supported by enzyme activity assays. Mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors were designed, based on this conserved structural region, and a uniform inhibition mechanism was elucidated from the structures of M(pro)-inhibitor complexes from severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A structure-assisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro inactivation of multiple CoV M(pro)s, potent antiviral activity, and extremely low cellular toxicity in cell-based assays.

Low-quality draft with error rates of \u223C1% (3\u00D7 to 6\u00D7 coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, as long as the target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures.","publish_time":"2005-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gardner, Shea N.; Lam, Marisa W.; Smith, Jason R.; Torres, Clinton L.; Slezak, Tom R.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d450fc8885843d48772df9a898552302f8c80b98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1266063.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1266063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-quality draft of target","low-quality draft of NNs","DNA signature prediction","draft data","number of target genomes","protein signature prediction","Sequencing pathogen genomes","target organisms","target isolates","sequencing errors","finished sequencing","SAP","high-quality diagnostic DNA","genomic sequencing necessary","computational Sequencing Analysis Pipeline","careful allocation of limited sequencing resources","error rates","coverage","simulations","high quality","underestimation of predicted protein signatures","detection of amino acid sequence conservation","close phylogenetic relatives","Marburg","neighbors","cost-effective investment","decisions","variola virus sequences","summary"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report a genetic and functional analysis of 19 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of Murine hepatitis virus MHV-A59 that are unable to synthesize viral RNA when the infection is initiated and maintained at the non-permissive temperature. Both classical and biochemical complementation analysis leads us to predict that the majority of MHV-A59 ORF1a replicase gene products (non-structural proteins nsp1\u2013nsp11) form a single complementation group (cistron1) while the replicase gene products encoded in ORF1b (non-structural proteins nsp12\u2013nsp16) are able to function in trans and comprise at least three, and possibly five, further complementation groups (cistrons II\u2013VI). Also, we have identified mutations in the non-structural proteins nsp 4, nsp5, nsp10, nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16 that are responsible for the ts phenotype of eight MHV-A59 mutants, which allows us to conclude that these proteins are essential for the assembly of a functional replicase-transcriptase complex. Finally, our analysis of viral RNA synthesis in ts mutant virus-infected cells allows us to discriminate three phenotypes with regard to the inability of specific mutants to synthesize viral RNA at the non-permissive temperature. Mutant LA ts6 appeared to be defective in continuing negative-strand synthesis, mutant Alb ts16 appeared to form negative strands but these were not utilized for positive-strand RNA synthesis, and mutant Alb ts22 was defective in the elongation of both positive- and negative-strand RNA. On the basis of these results, we propose a model that describes a pathway for viral RNA synthesis in MHV-A59-infected cells. Further biochemical analysis of these mutants should allow us to identify intermediates in this pathway and elucidate the precise function(s) of the viral replicase proteins involved.","publish_time":"2005-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sawicki, Stanley G; Sawicki, Dorothea L; Younker, Diane; Meyer, Yvonne; Thiel, Volker; Stokes, Helen; Siddell, Stuart G","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07fc7bb8cbdb82bd4b17681aa92a6fc06d5fcf82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1298938.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1298938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replicase proteins","analysis of viral RNA synthesis","assembly of viral","MHV-A59 mutants","positive-strand RNA synthesis","negative-strand RNA","non-structural proteins nsp12","cellular proteins","synthesis of genome","continuing negative-strand synthesis","ts mutant virus-infected cells","functional analysis","biochemical complementation analysis","biochemical analysis","mutants of Murine hepatitis virus MHV-A59","A59 ORF1a replicase gene products","functional replicase-transcriptase complex","majority of MHV","coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex","mutant Alb ts16","mutant Alb ts22","non-permissive temperature","ts phenotype","Mutant LA ts6","inability of specific mutants","nsp16","temperature-sensitive","negative strands","pathway","complementation groups","single complementation group","precise function","nsp11","ORF1b","nsp5","cistron1","subgenome-sized mRNAs","nsp14","nsp10","elongation","regard","phenotypes","model","mutations","results","cistrons","intermediates","infection","basis"],"language":"en"},

The C-type lectin DC-SIGN is known to be the major M. tuberculosis receptor on human dendritic cells. We reasoned that if DC-SIGN interacts with M. tuberculosis, as well as with other pathogens, variation in this gene might have a broad range of influence in the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We tested whether polymorphisms in CD209, the gene encoding DC-SIGN, are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis through sequencing and genotyping analyses in a South African cohort. After exclusion of significant population stratification in our cohort, we observed an association between two CD209 promoter variants (\u2212871G and \u2212336A) and decreased risk of developing tuberculosis. By looking at the geographical distribution of these variants, we observed that their allelic combination is mainly confined to Eurasian populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the two \u2212871G and \u2212336A variants confer protection against tuberculosis. In addition, the geographic distribution of these two alleles, together with their phylogenetic status, suggest that they may have increased in frequency in non-African populations as a result of host genetic adaptation to a longer history of exposure to tuberculosis. Further characterization of the biological consequences of DC-SIGN variation in tuberculosis will be crucial to better appreciate the role of this lectin in interactions between the host immune system and the tubercle bacillus as well as other pathogens.","publish_time":"2006-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barreiro, Luis B; Neyrolles, Olivier; Babb, Chantal L; Tailleux, Ludovic; Quach, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; McElreavey, Ken; van Helden, Paul D.; Hoal, Eileen G; Gicquel, Brigitte; Quintana-Murci, Lluis","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5add18a3b3f98e15c3afcc6186642140033d975.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1324949.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1324949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tuberculosis receptor","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","decreased risk of developing tuberculosis","SIGN variation","C-type lectin DC-SIGN","biological consequences of DC","CD209 promoter variants","pathogens","South African cohort","non-African populations","Eurasian populations","geographic distribution","geographical distribution","host immune system","result of host genetic adaptation","genotyping analyses","pathogenesis","longer history of exposure","tubercle bacillus","interactions","sequencing","human dendritic cells","number of infectious diseases","broad range of influence","alleles","association","susceptibility","exclusion of significant population stratification","role","allelic combination","characterization","polymorphisms","frequency","leading causes of mortality","FINDINGS","phylogenetic status","addition","protection","CONCLUSIONS","observations","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.","publish_time":"2006-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inoue, Manami; Iwasaki, Motoki; Otani, Tetsuya; Sasazuki, Shizuka; Tsugane, Shoichiro","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a78fd1b34372e1e54bf2a192d04aa36670cea307.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1351169.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351169/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West"],"keyphrases":["attributable fractions of cancer","attributable fraction responses","attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral","cancer prevention","genetic risk factors","risk factor candidates","Japanese general population","cancer-causing infection","major lifestyle factors","awareness","women","RESULTS","subjects","bacterial infection","higher values","food additives","air pollution","occupational exposure","relation","level of concern","nationwide representative sample","charred fish","information","perception","meat","epidemiologic evidence","present study","METHODS","diet","hand","West","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","tobacco smoking","alcohol drinking","Omnibus Survey","endocrine","chemicals","stress","Interviews"],"language":"en"},

While a number of syndromic surveillance systems are being evaluated in the US, very few have had success thus far in predicting an infectious disease event. Furthermore, to date, the majority of syndromic surveillance systems have been based primarily in emergency department settings, with varying levels of enhancement from other data sources. While research has been done on the value of telephone helplines on health care use and patient satisfaction, very few projects have looked at using a telephone helpline as a source of data for syndromic surveillance, and none have been attempted in Canada. The notable exception to this statement has been in the UK where research using the national NHS Direct system as a syndromic surveillance tool has been conducted. METHODS/DESIGN: The purpose of our proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Ontario\u0027s telephone nursing helpline system as a real-time syndromic surveillance system, and how its implementation, if successful, would have an impact on outbreak event detection in Ontario. Using data collected retrospectively, all \u0022reasons for call\u0022 and assigned algorithms will be linked to a syndrome category. Using different analytic methods, normal thresholds for the different syndromes will be ascertained. This will allow for the evaluation of the system\u0027s sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. The next step will include the prospective monitoring of syndromic activity, both temporally and spatially. DISCUSSION: As this is a study protocol, there are currently no results to report. However, this study has been granted ethical approval, and is now being implemented. It is our hope that this syndromic surveillance system will display high sensitivity and specificity in detecting true outbreaks within Ontario, before they are detected by conventional surveillance systems. Future results will be published in peer-reviewed journals so as to contribute to the growing body of evidence on syndromic surveillance, while also providing an non US-centric perspective.","publish_time":"2006-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rolland, Elizabeth; Moore, Kieran M; Robinson, Victoria A; McGuinness, Don","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b8bd7273e2cd3875283e705102b12ddf38d25c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1431529.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1431529/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","NHS Direct"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["syndromic surveillance tool","science of syndromic surveillance","real-time syndromic surveillance system","majority of syndromic surveillance systems","number of syndromic surveillance systems","conventional surveillance systems","prospective monitoring of syndromic activity","specificity","effectiveness of Ontario\u0027s telephone nursing helpline system","value of telephone helplines","source of data","data sources","research","proposed study","study protocol","national NHS Direct system","different analytic methods","high sensitivity","system\u0027s sensitivity","different syndromes","Future results","positive predictive value","outbreak event detection","infectious disease event","US-centric perspective","health care use","varying levels of enhancement","normal thresholds","patient satisfaction","impact","emergency department settings","true outbreaks","UK","purpose","growing body of evidence","statement","DESIGN","projects","evaluation","implementation","BACKGROUND","date","hope","peer-reviewed journals","algorithms","notable exception","step","success","ethical approval","reasons","syndrome category","DISCUSSION","infancy","Canada"],"language":"en"},

For an effective immune prophylaxis in humans, broad coverage of different strains of SARS-CoV and control of potential neutralization escape variants will be required. Combinations of virus-neutralizing, noncompeting mAbs may have these properties. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Human mAb CR3014 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and abolish pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV in infected ferrets. We generated in vitro SARS-CoV variants escaping neutralization by CR3014, which all had a single P462L mutation in the glycoprotein spike (S) of the escape virus. In vitro experiments confirmed that binding of CR3014 to a recombinant S fragment (amino acid residues 318\u2013510) harboring this mutation was abolished. We therefore screened an antibody-phage library derived from blood of a convalescent SARS patient for antibodies complementary to CR3014. A novel mAb, CR3022, was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like strain SZ3. No escape variants could be generated with CR3022. The mixture of both mAbs showed neutralization of SARS-CoV in a synergistic fashion by recognizing different epitopes on the receptor-binding domain. Dose reduction indices of 4.5 and 20.5 were observed for CR3014 and CR3022, respectively, at 100% neutralization. Because enhancement of SARS-CoV infection by subneutralizing antibody concentrations is of concern, we show here that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies do not convert the abortive infection of primary human macrophages by SARS-CoV into a productive one. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of two noncompeting human mAbs CR3014 and CR3022 potentially controls immune escape and extends the breadth of protection. At the same time, synergy between CR3014 and CR3022 may allow for a lower total antibody dose to be administered for passive immune prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2006-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"ter Meulen, Jan; van den Brink, Edward N; Poon, Leo L.

In some states, newborn screening may include genetic tests for a wide range of targets, but the costs and complexities of the newer genetic tests inhibit expansion of newborn screening. We describe the development and technical evaluation of a multiplex platform that may foster increased newborn genetic screening. METHODS: MultiCode(\u00AE) PLx involves three major steps: PCR, target-specific extension, and liquid chip decoding. Each step is performed in the same reaction vessel, and the test is completed in ~3 h. For site-specific labeling and room-temperature decoding, we use an additional base pair constructed from isoguanosine and isocytidine. We used the method to test for mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The developed test was performed manually and by automated liquid handling. Initially, 225 samples with a range of genotypes were tested retrospectively with the method. A prospective study used samples from \u003E400 newborns. RESULTS: In the retrospective study, 99.1% of samples were correctly genotyped with no incorrect calls made. In the perspective study, 95% of the samples were correctly genotyped for all targets, and there were no incorrect calls. CONCLUSIONS: The unique genetic multiplexing platform was successfully able to test for 31 targets within the CFTR gene and provides accurate genotype assignments in a clinical setting.","publish_time":"2004-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Scott C.; Marshall, David J.; Harms, Gerda; Miller, Christie M.; Sherrill, Christopher B.; Beaty, Edward L.; Lederer, Scott A.; Roesch, Eric B.; Madsen, Gary; Hoffman, Gary L.; Laessig, Ronald H.; Kopish, Greg J.; Baker, Mei Wang; Benner, Steven A.; Farrell, Philip M.; Prudent, James R.","journal":"Clinical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/315e5980d6fdce4553a9df8c0e36e55ffed32365.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1592527.xml.json","url":"http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/clinchem/50/11/2019.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["samples","increased newborn genetic screening","developed test","newer genetic tests","expansion of newborn screening","unique genetic multiplexing platform","CFTR gene","wide range of targets","states","retrospective study","newborns","prospective study","perspective study","incorrect calls","liquid chip decoding","multiplex platform","range of genotypes","room-temperature decoding","automated liquid handling","cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","target-specific extension","PCR","accurate genotype assignments","PLx","mutations","costs","complexities","additional base pair","major steps","isoguanosine","clinical setting","technical evaluation","kind of testing","CONCLUSIONS","isocytidine","development","policies","reaction vessel","METHODS","MultiCode","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Based on its 3D structure, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues essential for the RNA-binding activity of the IBV N protein and viral infectivity. Alanine substitution of either Arg-76 or Tyr-94 in the N-terminal domain of IBV N protein led to a significant decrease in its RNA-binding activity and a total loss of the infectivity of the viral RNA to Vero cells. In contrast, mutation of amino acid Gln-74 to an alanine, which does not affect the binding activity of the N-terminal domain, showed minimal, if any, detrimental effect on the infectivity of IBV. This study thus identifies residues critical for RNA binding on the nucleocapsid surface, and presents biochemical and genetic evidence that directly links the RNA binding capacity of the coronavirus N protein to the viral infectivity in cultured cells.

The purpose of this study was to model early recovery of physical function in patients undergoing total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty, using physical performance and self-report measures. METHODS: A sample of convenience of 152 subjects completed testing, of which 69 (mean age: 66.77 \u00B1 8.23 years) underwent THA and 83 (mean age: 60.25 \u00B1 11.19 years) TKA. Postoperatively, patients were treated using standardized care pathways and rehabilitation protocols. Using a repeated measures design, patients were assessed at multiple time points over the first four postoperative months. Outcome measures included the Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS), the physical function subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC PF), the 6 minute walk test (6 MWT), timed up and go test (TUG) and a timed stair test (ST). Average recovery curves for each of the measures were characterized using hierarchical linear modeling. Predictors of recovery were sequentially modeled after validation of the basic developmental models. RESULTS: Slopes of recovery were greater in the first 6 to 9 weeks with a second-degree polynomial growth term (weeks squared) providing a reasonable fit for the data over the study interval. Different patterns of recovery were observed between the self-report measures of physical function and the performance measures. In contrast to the models for the WOMAC PF and the LEFS, site of arthroplasty was a significant predictor (p = 0.001) in all of the physical performance measure models with the patients post TKA initially demonstrating higher function. Site of arthroplasty (p = 0.025) also predicted the rate of change for patients post THA and between 9 to 11 weeks after surgery, the THA group surpassed the function of the patients post TKA. CONCLUSION: Knowledge about the predicted growth curves will assist clinicians in referencing patient progress, and determining the critical time points for measuring change. The study has contributed further evidence to highlight the benefit of using physical performance measures to learn about the patients\u0027 actual level of disability.","publish_time":"2006-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kennedy, Deborah M; Stratford, Paul W; Hanna, Steven E; Wessel, Jean; Gollish, Jeffrey D","journal":"BMC Musculoskelet Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bf165f82a8648b69169a66114d29c690f0562e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1712335.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1712335/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["THA","TKA","WOMAC PF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["physical performance measures","early recovery of physical function","self-report measures of physical function","physical function subscale","Outcome measures","TKA","higher function","physical performance measure models","Slopes of recovery","Predictors of recovery","weeks","site of arthroplasty","repeated measures design","Average recovery curves","Different patterns of recovery","THA group","Lower Extremity Function Scale","WOMAC PF","LEFS","patient progress","predicted growth curves","timed stair test","years","mean age","study interval","patient rehabilitation needs","critical time points","multiple time points","minute walk test","basic developmental models","benchmark progress","rehabilitation protocols","rate of change","second-degree polynomial growth term","Western Ontario","McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index","appropriate decisions","total hip","standardized care pathways","clinicians","knee","data","Knowledge","validation","significant predictor","TUG","Information","benefit","patients\u0027 actual level of disability","reasonable fit","sample of convenience","MWT","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","hierarchical linear modeling","BACKGROUND","surgery","postoperative months","METHODS","subjects","evidence","contrast","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the effect of inefficient response is a potentially important contribution of epidemic theory. To develop this understanding we studied societal learning during emerging outbreaks wherein patient removal accelerates as information is gathered and disseminated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed an extension of a standard outbreak model, the simple stochastic epidemic, which accounts for societal learning. We obtained expressions for the expected outbreak size and the distribution of epidemic duration. We found that rapid learning noticeably affects the final outbreak size even when learning exhibits diminishing returns (relaxation). As an example, we estimated the learning rate for the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore. Evidence for relaxation during the first eight weeks of the outbreak was inconclusive. We estimated that if societal learning had occurred at half the actual rate, the expected final size of the outbreak would have reached nearly 800 cases, more than three times the observed number of infections. By contrast, the expected outbreak size for societal learning twice as effective was 116 cases. CONCLUSION: These results show that the rate of societal learning can greatly affect the final size of disease outbreaks, justifying investment in early warning systems and attentiveness to disease outbreak by both government authorities and the public. We submit that the burden of emerging infections, including the risk of a global pandemic, could be efficiently reduced by improving procedures for rapid detection of outbreaks, alerting public health officials, and aggressively educating the public at the start of an outbreak.","publish_time":"2006-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drake, John M.; Chew, Suok Kai; Ma, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19717b7bfa9911835e3c0085633f6dec5453da9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1762333.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["final outbreak size","expected outbreak size","rapid learning","learning rate","rate of societal learning","expected final size","standard outbreak model","final size of disease outbreaks","emerging outbreaks","rapid detection of outbreaks","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Rapid response","outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","actual rate","burden of emerging infections","relaxation","cases","simple stochastic epidemic","distribution of epidemic duration","public health officials","important contribution of epidemic theory","effect of inefficient response","observed number of infections","attentiveness","investment","early warning systems","uncertain diagnoses","patient removal","SARS","exhibits","government authorities","times","risk","extension","delayed communication","Singapore","information","returns","procedures","weeks","results","BACKGROUND","expressions","contrast","FINDINGS","global pandemic","example","start","METHODS","CONCLUSION","Evidence"],"language":"en"},

We quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The model constructed for this time delay accounts for: (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. CONCLUSIONS: The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza.","publish_time":"2007-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caley, Peter; Becker, Niels G.; Philp, David J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1764036.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["source region","at-risk country","time delay accounts","influenza pandemic","epidemic of pandemic strain influenza","travel volumes","international travel","pandemic strain of influenza","local epidemic","infected travelers","epidemic growth","number of travelers","nascent pandemic","severe travel restrictions","model","random time","non-pharmaceutical interventions","infected individual","infected arrival","chance","possibility of in-flight transmission","Elevated in-flight transmission","symptomatic infection","border screening","disease reproduction number","arriving passengers","early presentation of cases","moderate reduction","protective mask","countries","terms","subsequent initiation","separate components","favourable circumstances","exit","start","entry borders","preparedness planning","Efforts","distribution","matter of days","months","momentum","course","reliable method","weeks","METHODS","FINDINGS","hand","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge. A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment. Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection.

However, it is still largely unclear how T-cell migration from the lymphoid periphery to the bone marrow is regulated. In the present report, we show that antigen-specific CD4 T cells, as well as antigen-specific CD8 T cells, localize to the bone marrow of immunized mice, and are sustained there over long periods of time. To investigate the rules governing T-cell migration to the bone marrow, we generated chimeric mice in which the lymphoid periphery contained two genetically or phenotypically distinct groups of T cells, one of which was identical to the host. We then examined whether a distinct type of T cell had an advantage over the others in the colonization of bone marrow. Our results show that whereas ICAM1 and CD18 molecules are both involved in homing to lymph nodes, neither is crucial for T-cell bone marrow colonization. We also observed that memory-phenotype CD44(high) T cells, but not virgin-type CD44(\u2212/low) T cells, preferentially home to the bone marrow upon adoptive transfer to normal young mice, but not to thymectomized old recipients where an existing memory T-cell pool precludes their free access. Thus, T-cell colonization of the bone marrow uses distinct molecules from those implicated in lymph node homing, and is regulated both by the properties of the T cell and by the competitive efficacy of other T cells inhabiting the same, saturable niche. This implies that the homing potential of an individual lymphocyte is not merely an intrinsic property of the cell, but rather a property of the lymphoid system taken as a whole.","publish_time":"2003-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Rosa, Francesca; Santoni, Angela","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c6adff0ada1e274998155234a1f05fe372040b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1782895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1782895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cell colonization","T-cell bone marrow colonization","T-cell migration","bone marrow of memory CD8 T cells","distinct type of T cell","colonization of bone marrow","distinct groups of T cells","antigen-specific CD8 T cells","existing memory T-cell pool","antigen-specific CD4 T cells","bone marrow of immunized mice","distinct molecules","lymphoid periphery","memory-phenotype CD44","chimeric mice","lymph node homing","homing potential","lymphoid system","normal young mice","virgin-type CD44","CD18 molecules","lymph nodes","intrinsic property","adoptive transfer","competitive efficacy","individual lymphocyte","old recipients","advantage","free access","ICAM1","rules","presence","saturable niche","long periods of time","results","present report","properties","host"],"language":"en"},

This approach is not justified in children less than 2 years of age and this for several reasons. First, AOM is an acute inflammation of the middle ear caused in about 70% of cases by bacteria. Redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane are characteristic findings in bacterial AOM. Second, AOM is associated with long-term dysfunction of the inflamed eustachian tube (ET), particularly in children less than 2 years of age. In this age group, the small calibre of the ET together with its horizontal direction result in impaired clearance, ventilation and protection of the middle ear. Third, recent prospective studies have shown poor long-term prognosis of AOM in children below 2 years with at least 50% of recurrences and persisting otitis media with effusion (OME) in about 35% 6 months after AOM. Viruses elicit AOM in about 30% of children. A prolonged course of AOM has been observed when bacterial and viral infections are combined because viral infection is also associated with ET dysfunction in young children. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is an excellent tool both for initial treatment and recurrence of AOM. Antibiotic treatment of AOM is mandatory in children less than 2 years of age to decrease inflammation in the middle ear but also of the ET particularly during the first episode. The best choice is amoxicillin because of its superior penetration in the middle ear. Streptococci pneumoniae with intermediary bacterial resistance to penicillin are particularly associated with recurrent AOM. Therefore the dosage of amoxicillin should be 90 mg/kg per day in three doses. In recurrent AOM with \u03B2-lactamase-producing bacilli, amoxicillin should be associated with clavulanic acid at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg per day. The duration of the treatment is not established yet but 10 days is reasonable for a first episode of AOM. OME may be a precursor initiating AOM but also a complication thereof. OME needs a watchful waiting approach. When associated with deafness for 2\u20133 months in children over 2 years of age, an antibiotic should be given according to the results of the bacterial resistance in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The high rate of complications of tympanostomy tube insertion outweighs the beneficial effect on hearing loss. The poor results of this procedure are due to the absence of effects on ET dysfunction. Pneumococcal vaccination has little beneficial effects on recurrent AOM and its use in infants needs further studies. Treatment with amoxicillin is indicated in all children younger than 2 years with a first episode of AOM presenting with redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane. Combined amoxicillin and clavulanic acid should be given in patients with \u03B2-lactamase-producing bacteria. The duration of treatment is estimated to be at least 10 days depending on the findings by pneumo-otoscopy and tympanometry. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is highly recommended particularly in children in day care centres as well as for regular follow-up. The high recurrence rate is due to the long-lasting dysfunction of the eustachian tube and the immune immaturity of children less than 2 years of age.","publish_time":"2007-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corbeel, Lucien","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17845fc831495c6ed20d436bbab6a7a0c77a48ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1876255.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AOM","ET","OME"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial AOM","recurrent AOM","episode of AOM","recurrence of AOM","Antibiotic treatment of AOM","years of age","prolonged course of AOM","young children","children younger","poor long-term prognosis of AOM","ET dysfunction","immune immaturity of children","middle ear","intermediary bacterial resistance","increased bacterial resistance","age group","Combined amoxicillin","duration of treatment","long-term dysfunction","nasopharyngeal aspirate","viral infections","viral testing","initial treatment","dosage of amoxicillin","days","long-lasting dysfunction","inflamed eustachian tube","beneficial effects","acute otitis media","acute inflammation","\u03B2-lactamase","tympanic membrane","high recurrence rate","clavulanic acid","poor results","Redness","antibiotic administration","months","tympanostomy tube insertion","persisting otitis media","high rate of complications","day care centres","watchful waiting approach","characteristic findings","absence of effects","respiratory infections","recent prospective studies","ventilation","penicillin","excellent tool","superior penetration","impaired clearance","effusion","protection","recurrences","horizontal direction","Streptococci pneumoniae","patients","small calibre","infants","hearing loss","pneumo-otoscopy","best choice","Pneumococcal vaccination","tympanometry","procedure","bacilli","precursor","regular follow-up","cases","deafness","doses","reasons","Viruses"],"language":"en"},

Reference gene stability may vary between different tissues, and between the same tissue in different disease states. We evaluated the stability of 9 reference genes commonly used in human gene expression studies. Real-time reverse transcription PCR and a mathematical algorithm were used to establish which reference genes were most stably expressed in normal and diseased canine articular tissues and two canine cell lines stimulated with lipolysaccaride (LPS). RESULTS: The optimal reference genes for comparing gene expression data between normal and diseased infrapatella fat pad were RPL13A and YWHAZ (M = 0.56). The ideal reference genes for comparing normal and osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage were RPL13A and SDHA (M = 0.57). The best reference genes for comparing normal and ruptured canine cranial cruciate ligament were B2M and TBP (M = 0.59). The best reference genes for normalising gene expression data from normal and LPS stimulated cell lines were SDHA and YWHAZ (K6) or SDHA and HMBS (DH82), which had expression stability (M) values of 0.05 (K6) and 0.07 (DH82) respectively. The number of reference genes required to reduce pairwise variation (V) to \u003C0.20 was 4 for cell lines, 5 for cartilage, 7 for cranial cruciate ligament and 8 for fat tissue. Reference gene stability was not related to the level of gene expression. CONCLUSION: The reference genes demonstrating the most stable expression within each different canine articular tissue were identified, but no single reference gene was identified as having stable expression in all different tissue types. This study underlines the necessity to select reference genes on the basis of tissue and disease specific expression profile evaluation and highlights the requirement for the identification of new reference genes with greater expression stability for use in canine articular tissue gene expression studies.","publish_time":"2007-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayers, Duncan; Clements, Dylan N; Salway, Fiona; Day, Philip JR","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e2b123ad273e69afefb875594ac0fac7c785c74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1884148.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1884148/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Reference gene stability","use of reference genes","best reference genes","optimal reference genes","ideal reference genes","number of reference genes","single reference gene","quantification of gene expression","level of gene expression","identification of new reference genes","stable expression","canine articular tissue gene expression studies","normalising gene expression data","human gene expression studies","greater expression stability","different canine articular tissue","fat tissue","tissue samples","different tissue types","basis of tissue","canine cell lines","different tissues","different samples","disease specific expression profile evaluation","diseased canine articular tissues","SDHA","different disease states","LPS stimulated cell lines","ruptured canine cranial cruciate ligament","YWHAZ","cartilage","RPL13A","K6","DH82","diseased infrapatella fat pad","B2M","requirement","transcript numbers","mathematical algorithm","Real-time reverse transcription PCR","OA","TBP","lipolysaccaride","HMBS","BACKGROUND","variation","necessity","values","RESULTS","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The viral genome consists of eight RNA segments that are frequently exchanged between different viruses via a process known as genetic reassortment. A complete genotype nomenclature is essential to describe gene segment reassortment. Specialized bioinformatic tools to analyze reassortment are not available, which hampers progress in understanding its role in host range, virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses. To meet this need, we have developed a nomenclature to name influenza A genotypes and implemented a web server, FluGenome (http://www.flugenome.org/), for the assignment of lineages and genotypes. FluGenome provides functions for the user to interrogate the database in different modalities and get detailed reports on lineages and genotypes. These features make FluGenome unique in its ability to automatically detect genotype differences attributable to reassortment events in influenza A virus evolution.","publish_time":"2007-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Guoqing; Rowley, Thaine; Garten, Rebecca; Donis, Ruben O.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d47eb01f2085b582008bb1ff7c604355c5f4c582.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1933150.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1933150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Specialized","FluGenome"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genotypes","transmissibility of influenza viruses","reassortment events","genetic reassortment","different viruses","gene segment reassortment","FluGenome unique","distinct lineages","assignment of lineages","complete genotype nomenclature","different modalities","virus evolution","genotype differences attributable","ability","virulence","detailed reports","host range","role","database","user","process","RNA segments","mammalian species","web server","Specialized bioinformatic tools","viral genome","progress","features","functions","need"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, high mutation rates may lead to extensive changes in viral nucleic acid sequences making dedicated PCR primer use problematic. Furthermore, in bioterrorism, viral consensus sequences can be genetically modified as a countermeasure to RT-PCR and DNA chip detection. Accordingly, there is a great need for the development of rapid and universal virus detection and identification technologies. RESULTS: We report herein that viral genomic DNA or RNA can be separated from host nucleic acids in plasma by filtration and nuclease digestion, and randomly amplified in a single PCR using a mixture of primers designed to be resistant to primer-dimer amplification (5\u0027-VVVVVVVVAA-3\u0027, V = A, G or C; 3(8 )or 6561 primers). We have termed this novel PCR method Random Multiplex (RT)-PCR since hundreds of overlapping PCR amplifications occur simultaneously. Using this method, we have successfullydetected and partially sequenced 3 separate viruses in human plasma without using virus-specific reagents (i.e., Adenovirus Type 17, Coxsackievirus A7, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus B). The method is sensitive to ~1000 genome equivalents/ml and may represent the fastest means of detection of unknown viruses. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that the further development of random multiplex (RT)-PCR may lead to a diagnostic assay that can universally detect viruses in donated blood products as well as in patients suffering with idiopathic disease states of possible viral etiology.","publish_time":"2007-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clem, Amy L; Sims, Jonathan; Telang, Sucheta; Eaton, John W; Chesney, Jason","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86febf1edc351777b6424be2ee9a2e521176dd98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1950496.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950496/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","Random Multiplex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR","single PCR","PCR-based detection","dedicated PCR primer","novel PCR method Random Multiplex","identification of viruses","detection of unknown viruses","hundreds of overlapping PCR amplifications","universal virus detection","separate viruses","viral consensus sequences","viral genomic DNA","DNA chip detection","viral nucleic acid sequences","development of random multiplex","virus-specific reagents","human plasma","development of rapid","idiopathic disease states of possible viral etiology","Respiratory Syncytial Virus B","identification technologies","mixture of primers","stable genome","genome equivalents","host nucleic acids","primer-dimer amplification","extensive changes","Coxsackievirus A7","filtration","patients","Adenovirus Type","RNA","high mutation rates","donated blood products","nuclease digestion","VVVVVVVVAA","great need","bioterrorism","diagnostic assay","BACKGROUND","countermeasure","studies","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Proper treatment, however, depends on correct identification of the pathogen involved as antibiotics provide little or no benefit with viral infections. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and microarray for URI identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques, with electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. The assay was developed to detect four bacterial pathogens (Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and 9 viral pathogens (adenovirus 4, coronavirus OC43, 229E and HK, influenza A and B, parainfluinza types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus. This new platform forms the basis for a fully automated diagnostics system that is very flexible and can be customized to suit different or additional pathogens. Multiple probes on a flexible platform allow one to test probes empirically and then select highly reactive probes for further iterative evaluation. Because ECD uses an enzymatic reaction to create electrical signals that can be read directly from the array, there is no need for image analysis or for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment. We show assay sensitivity and specificity that are excellent for a multiplexed format.","publish_time":"2007-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lodes, Michael J.; Suciu, Dominic; Wilmoth, Jodi L.; Ross, Marty; Munro, Sandra; Dix, Kim; Bernards, Karen; St\u00F6ver, Axel G.; Quintana, Miguel; Iihoshi, Naomi; Lyon, Wanda J.; Danley, David L.; McShea, Andrew","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/753d7438fe0a32b2c68985a255f92661145d46d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1976596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1976596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["ECD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral pathogens","bacterial pathogens","viral infections","URI identification","viral upper respiratory infections","additional pathogens","ECD","assay sensitivity","reactive probes","flexible platform","Multiple probes","sensitive genotyping assay","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","correct identification","new platform","respiratory syncytial virus","semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray","Streptococcus pyogenes","hybridization techniques","standard amplification","Bordetella pertussis","coronavirus OC43","influenza","HK","basis","electrochemical detection","delicate optical scanning equipment","image analysis","need","enzymatic reaction","automated diagnostics system","antibiotics","specificity","benefit","adenovirus","parainfluinza types","variable clinical symptoms","electrical signals","iterative evaluation","multiplexed format","Proper treatment","etiologic agent"],"language":"en"}]}

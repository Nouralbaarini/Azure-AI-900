Design: Prospective case series. Setting: Walk-in medical clinic of a university hospital. Patients: 507 patients with cold or flu symptoms, sore throat, or recent cough; 21 control subjects without symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Measurements and main results: After thorough history and physical examination, the patients underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration and throat culture. Nasopharyngeal specimens were cultured for both bacteria and viruses; antigens for influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were sought by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); serum antibodies to viral respiratory pathogens were determined. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci grew from the throat specimens of 39 of the 507 patients (8%) or 38 of 3 34 patients (11%) who had clinical diagnoses of pharyngitis. Thirty-three cases of influenza A, 20 cases of influenza B, and seven cases of parainfluenza infections were diagnosed. Bacteria were cultured from the nasopharyngeal secretions of 284 patients (56%). In contrast to pharyngeal culture, commensal mixed flora were rarely found in nasopharyngeal culture. Nasopharyngeal culture of bacteria usually considered to be respiratory pathogens was significantly associated with the presence of leukocytes.Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio 6.0, 95% confidence interval 2.6\u201314.2),Moraxella catarrbalis (odds ratio 12.9, 95% confidence interval 3.1\u201379.5), andHemophilus influenzae (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2\u20137.4) were all associated with the presence of leukocytes. In contrast, nasophaiyngeal culture of coagulase-negative staphylococci, mixed flora, and the documentation of a viral infection were not associated with the presence of leukocytes. For none of 21 control subjects were \u201Cpathogenic\u201D bacteria found. Conclusions: These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria may have a causal role in adult nasopharyngitis, although further data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","publish_time":"1993-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heald, Alison; Auckenthaler, Raymond; Borst, Francois; Delaspre, Olca; Cermann, Daniel; Matter, Lukas; Kaiser, Laurent; Stalder, Hans","journal":"J Gen Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e1c41f42300b4c328b7686b4fe370aa55681bcc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Patients","Nasopharyngeal culture of bacteria","throat culture","pathogenic bacteria","Nasopharyngeal specimens","odds ratio","symptoms of upper respiratory infection","viral respiratory pathogens","confidence interval","nasopharyngeal aspiration","nasopharyngeal secretions","presence of leukocytes","cause of adult upper respiratory infection","throat specimens","viral infection","respiratory syncytial virus","nasophaiyngeal culture of coagulase","cases of influenza B","sore throat","adult nasopharyngitis","control subjects","contrast","cases of parainfluenza infections","data","commensal mixed flora","flu symptoms","bacterial nasopharyngitis","ELISA","serum antibodies","thorough history","negative staphylococci","physical examination","recent cough","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Walk-in medical clinic","causal role","main results","university hospital","documentation","Moraxella catarrbalis","andHemophilus influenzae","viruses","antigens","beta-hemolytic streptococci","Design","Prospective case series","Setting","Measurements","clinical diagnoses of pharyngitis","Objective","Conclusions","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

The most common pathogens include coxsackie virus (CV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, no antiviral agents with low toxicity and drug resistance are currently available in clinic therapy. The present study aimed to examine the antiviral activities of emodin (an ingredient of Rheum palmatum) against CVB5 and RSV infections, in an attempt to discover new antiviral agents for virus infection. The monomer emodin was extracted and isolated from Rheum palmatum. The antiviral activities of emodin on HEp-2 cells were evaluated, including virus replication inhibition, virucidal and anti-absorption effects, by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tet-razolium bromide (MTT) assay and plaque reduction assay (PRA). The kinetics of virus inhibition by emodin in a period of 14 h was further determined by plaque assay and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Cytokine (IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1) mRNA expressions after emodin treatment (7.5, 15, 30 \u03BCmol/L) were also assessed by qPCR post-infection. The results showed that emodin had potent inhibitory activities against CVB5 and RSV, with the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) ranging from 13.06 to 14.27 \u03BCmol/L and selectivity index (SI) being 5.38\u20136.41 \u03BCmol/L. However, emodin couldn\u2019t directly inactivate the viruses or block their absorption to cells. It acted as a biological synthesis inhibitor against CVB(4) and RSV in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, especially during the first 0\u20134 h post-infection. Moreover, emodin could decrease the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03B1 but enhance TNF-\u03B3 expression significantly compared to the viral controls in vitro.

No BLPD was observed following autologous HSCT, so risk factor analyses were confined to the 1542 allogeneic HSCT. Factors assessed were HLA-mismatching (\u2A7E1 antigen), T cell depletion (TCD), presence of acute GvHD (grades II\u2013IV), donor type (related vs unrelated), age of recipient and donor, and underlying disease. Factors found to be statistically significant included patients transplanted for immune deficiency and CML, donor age \u2A7E18 years, TCD, and HLA-mismatching, with recipients of combined TCD and HLA-mismatched grafts having the highest incidence. Factors found to be statistically significant in a multiple regression analysis were TCD, donor age and immune deficiency, although 7/8 of the patients with immunodeficiencies and BLPD received a TCD graft from a haploidentical parent. The overall mortality was 92% (24/26). One patient had a spontaneous remission, but subsequently died \u003E1 year later of chronic GVHD. Thirteen patients received therapy for BLPD. Three patients received lymphocyte infusions without response. The only patients with responses and long-term survival received alpha interferon \u03B1IFN). Of seven patients treated with \u03B1IFN there were four responses (one partial and three complete).

We review Phases I and I/II results from these clinical trials. dl1520 and rAd.p53 were well-tolerated following hepatic artery infusion at doses of up to 2\u00D710(12) and 2.5\u00D710(13) particles, respectively. At a dose of 7.5\u00D710(13) particles, rAd.p53 was associated with dose-limiting cardiac output suppression; dl1520 dose escalation did not proceed higher than 2\u00D710(12).

Mild/moderate transaminitis was demonstrated in some patients on both the hepatic arterial and i.v. trials at doses \u226510(12) particles. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were induced in a dose-dependent manner in most patients, but significant interpatient and intrapatient (on repeat doses) variabilities were demonstrated.

From January 1994 to March 1996, 47 consecutive adult patients received VUD-BMT. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin A/short course methotrexate/prednisolone, and in four patients additional ATG. Post-transplantation, cohorts of patients received rhG-CSF (5 \u03BCg/kg/day) (n = 22) or no rhG-CSF (n = 25) in a non-randomized manner.

High serum levels of angiotensin II appear to be linked to the severity and lethality of infection, at least in some patients. In experimental mouse models, infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus results in downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the lung and increased serum angiotensin II levels. Genetic inactivation of ACE2 causes severe lung injury in H5N1-challenged mice, confirming a role of ACE2 in H5N1-induced lung pathologies. Administration of recombinant human ACE2 ameliorates avian influenza H5N1 virus-induced lung injury in mice.

However, de novo and acquired antibody resistance is one of the major limitations of trastuzumab therapy warranting the search for other therapeutic strategies. One of the most remarkable features of adenovirus (AdV)-based vaccine is its ability to induce exceptionally high and sustained frequencies of transgene product-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses. In this study, we constructed two recombinant AdVs (AdV(OVA) and AdV(HER-2)) expressing ovalbumin (OVA) and HER-2/neu, and assessed AdV-induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses and preventive/therapeutic antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that AdV(OVA) stimulates efficient OVA-specific CD8(\u002B) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer responses, leading to preventive long-term immunity against OVA-expressing BL6-10ova melanoma in wild-type C56BL/6 mice. We further demonstrate that AdV(HER-2) stimulates HER-2/neu-specific CD8(\u002B) CTL responses, leading to a significant reduction in breast carcinogenesis in transgenic FVBneuN mice (P\u003C0.05), but has little therapeutic effect on pre-existing Tg1-1 tumor even at early stage (15 mm(3)). In contrast, the anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy is capable of completely inhibiting Tg1-1 tumor growth at early stage, but fails to eradicate well-established Tg1-1 breast tumor (100 mm(3)). Interestingly, a combinatorial immunotherapy of anti-HER-2/neu antibody with AdV(HER-2) vaccine was capable of curing 4 of 10 studied mice bearing well-established Tg1-1 breast tumors and significantly delaying in death of the remaining six tumor-bearing mice (P\u003C0.05). Taken together, our results suggest an adjuvant effect of AdV(HER-2) on anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy for well-established breast tumor in transgenic FVBneuN mice, and this combinatorial immunotherapy of trastuzumab with AdV(HER-2) vaccine may be used as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of advanced HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer.","publish_time":"2011-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Y; Xie, Y; Chan, T; Sami, A; Ahmed, S; Liu, Q; Xiang, J","journal":"Cancer Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e44fbe01010454789c97dcd18dd3ce6f10598fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AdV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neu antibody therapy","neu-specific CD8","well-established breast tumor","neu-positive breast cancer","adjuvant effect of AdV","breast carcinogenesis","efficient OVA-specific CD8","well-established Tg1","tumor growth","breast tumors","ova melanoma","transgenic FVBneuN mice","CTL responses","AdV-induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses","studied mice","therapeutic effect","antibody resistance","combinatorial immunotherapy of anti-","pre-existing Tg1","therapeutic strategies","T-cell responses","therapeutic antitumor immunity","combinatorial immunotherapy of trastuzumab","natural killer responses","trastuzumab monotherapy","major limitations of trastuzumab therapy","new therapeutic strategy","based vaccine","early stage","sustained frequencies of transgene product-specific CD8","preventive long-term immunity","treatment of advanced","capable of curing","advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor","cytotoxic T lymphocyte","BL6","significant reduction","wild-type C56BL","patients","search","ability","death","recombinant AdVs","remarkable features of adenovirus","results","study","novo","contrast","ovalbumin"],"language":"en"},

This is the first report of intra-vascular administration with a genetically engineered, replication-selective virus. A phase I dose-escalation trial was performed in patients with liver-predominant gastrointestinal carcinoma (n = 11 total; primarily colorectal). dl1520 was infused into the hepatic artery at doses of 2 \u00D7 10(8)\u20132 \u00D7 10(12) particles for two cycles (days 1 and 8). Subsequent cycles of dl1520 were administered in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin. No dose-limiting toxicity, maximally tolerated dose or treatment-emergent clinical hepatotoxicity were identified following dl1520 infusion. Mild to moderate fever, rigors and fatigue were the most common adverse events. Antibody titers increased significantly in all patients. Viral replication was detectable in patients receiving the highest two doses. An objective response was demonstrated in combination with chemotherapy in a patient who was refractory to both 5-FU and dl1520 as single agents. Therefore, hepatic artery infusion of the attenuated adenovirus dl1520 was well-tolerated at doses resulting in infection, replication and chemotherapy-associated antitumoral activity.","publish_time":"2001-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reid, T; Galanis, E; Abbruzzese, J; Sze, D; Andrews, J; Romel, L; Hatfield, M; Rubin, J; Kirn, D","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/749ae58147d84859c6f659b62572f9300155e8f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication-defective adenovirus","replication-incompetent","Viral replication","attenuated adenovirus dl1520","replication-selective adenoviruses","replication-selective virus","following dl1520 infusion","patients","doses","Subsequent cycles of dl1520","safety of intra-vascular adenovirus administration","clinical trial","report of intra-vascular administration","dose-escalation trial","combination","hepatic artery infusion","chemotherapy-associated antitumoral activity","feasibility of vascular delivery","treatment-emergent clinical hepatotoxicity","patient death","treatment of cancer","fatigue","infection","liver-predominant gastrointestinal carcinoma","rigors","moderate fever","total","distant tumors","intratumoral injection","common adverse events","addition","fluorouracil","phase","refractory","single agents","objective response","particles","days","diseases","Antibody titers","ONYX","leucovorin","Concerns"],"language":"en"},

Some of these compounds are useful for human therapeutics. There are two major forms of honeybee venom used in pharmacological applications: manually (or reservoir disrupting) extracted glandular venom (GV), and venom extracted through the use of electrical stimulation (ESV). A proteome comparison of these two venom forms and an understanding of the phosphorylation status of ESV, are still very limited. Here, the proteomes of GV and ESV were compared using both gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches and the phosphoproteome of ESV was determined through the use of TiO(2) enrichment. RESULTS: Of the 43 proteins identified in GV, \u003C 40% were venom toxins, and \u003E 60% of the proteins were non-toxic proteins resulting from contamination by gland tissue damage during extraction and bee death. Of the 17 proteins identified in ESV, 14 proteins (\u003E80%) were venom toxic proteins and most of them were found in higher abundance than in GV. Moreover, two novel proteins (dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 11-like and histone H2B.3-like) and three novel phosphorylation sites (icarapin (S43), phospholipase A-2 (T145), and apamin (T23)) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that venom extracted manually is different from venom extracted using ESV, and these differences may be important in their use as pharmacological agents. ESV may be more efficient than GV as a potential pharmacological source because of its higher venom protein content, production efficiency, and without the need to kill honeybee. The three newly identified phosphorylated venom proteins in ESV may elicit a different immune response through the specific recognition of antigenic determinants. The two novel venom proteins extend our proteome coverage of honeybee venom.","publish_time":"2013-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Rongli; Zhang, Lan; Fang, Yu; Han, Bin; Lu, Xiaoshan; Zhou, Tiane; Feng, Mao; Li, Jianke","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c8a0fb2f60c243f71d16d5fefb5b51d7978869e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3835400.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199871/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel venom proteins","phosphorylated venom proteins","venom forms","glandular venom","novel proteins","proteome coverage of honeybee venom","major forms of honeybee venom","non-toxic proteins","phosphoproteome of ESV","higher venom protein content","phosphorylation status of ESV","proteomes of GV","pharmacological applications","pharmacological agents","novel phosphorylation sites","use of TiO","potential pharmacological source","use of electrical stimulation","higher abundance","proteome comparison","active compounds","different immune response","gel-free proteomics approaches","contamination","gland tissue damage","extraction","reductase SDR family member","production efficiency","dehydrogenase","complicated defensive toxin","wide range","icarapin","S43","reservoir disrupting","specific recognition of antigenic determinants","understanding","bee death","T145","phospholipase","human therapeutics","need","differences","BACKGROUND","histone H2B","apamin","T23","enrichment","CONCLUSIONS","data","RESULTS","toxins"],"language":"en"},

Methods ANFH was induced by a combination of hypersensitivity vasculitis caused by injection of horse serum and subsequent administration of a high dose of corticosteroid. The pathological changes were detected with digital radiography (DR), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ink artery infusion angiography, hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results The imageological and pathological changes corresponded to the clinical characteristics of early stage ANFH. DR showed bilaterally increased bone density, an unclear epiphyseal line, and blurred texture of cancellous bone. CT showed spot-like low-density imaging of cancellous bone, thinner cortical bone, osteoporosis, and an unclear epiphyseal line. MRI showed bone marrow edema and spot-like high signals in T2-weighted imaging in cancellous bone. Ink artery infusion angiography showed fewer obstructed blood vessels in the femoral head. HE staining of pathological sections showed fewer trabeculae and thin bone, an increased proportion of empty osteocyte lacunae, decreased hematopoiesis, thrombosis, and fat cell hypertrophy. Immunohistochemistry showed attenuated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and on the inner membrane of blood vessels. Conclusion Experimental rabbit model of early stage ANFH caused by corticosteroid can be successfully established and provide the foundation for developing effective methods to treat early stage ANFH.","publish_time":"2008-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"WEN, Qian; MA, Li; CHEN, Yan-Ping; YANG, Lin; LUO, Wei; WANG, Xiao-Ning","journal":"Biomedical and Environmental Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80ddfdb396529de0a944b29264f6475ab0930224.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398808600604; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0895-3988(08)60060-4; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398808600604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19133613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low-density imaging of cancellous bone","pathological changes","Methods ANFH","increased bone density","thinner cortical bone","blurred texture of cancellous bone","bone marrow edema","clinical characteristics of early stage ANFH","Conclusion Experimental rabbit model of early stage ANFH","pathological sections","experimental model of early stage avascular necrosis","ink artery infusion angiography","T2-weighted imaging","magnetic resonance imaging","spot","MRI","femoral head","unclear epiphyseal line","various imaging techniques","high dose of corticosteroid","immunohistochemistry","fewer obstructed blood vessels","high signals","fewer trabeculae","increased proportion","inner membrane of blood vessels","effective methods","eosin staining","thrombosis","attenuated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor","hematoxylin","osteoporosis","subsequent administration","injection of horse serum","decreased hematopoiesis","chondrocytes","osteocyte lacunae","computed tomography","digital radiography","osteoblasts","combination of hypersensitivity vasculitis","fat cell hypertrophy","adult rabbits","Abstract Objective","foundation","imageological"],"language":"en"},

Immunofluorescence showed that all cells became infected at a multiplicity of 10 PFU/cell. The virus was concentrated and purified to obtain the high titered stocks needed for these one-step growth experiments. Release of virus into the culture medium started 4 hr after infection (pi) and was complete at 10 hr pi. Synthesis of virus-specific RNA, measured by the incorporation of [3H]uridine in the presence of 1 \u03BCg/ml actinomycin D, also started at 4 hr pi and its maximum rate occurred between 6 and 8 hr pi. RNA labeled during this period was isolated from infected cells. About 50% of this RNA bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured with glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Seven RNA species with the following molecular weights were present: 5.6 \u00D7 106 (RNA1), 4.0 \u00D7 106 (RNA2), 3.0 \u00D7 106 (RNA3), 1.4 \u00D7 106 (RNA4), 1.2 \u00D7 106 (RNA5), 0.9 \u00D7 106 (RNA6), and 0.6 \u00D7 106 (RNA7). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. To determine whether these RNA species were functional as messengers in infected cells, virus-specific RNAs present in polyribosomes were analyzed. EDTA treatment was used to discriminate between RNA present in polyribosomes and in EDTA-resistant, presumably ribonucleoprotein, particles. Most (91%) of RNA1 was present in EDTA-resistant particles; the remainder and all other RNAs synthesized between 6 and 8 hr pi were present in polyribosomes. We conclude that MHV-A59 has six subgenomic mRNAs. Since the total molecular mass (11.1 \u00D7 106 daltons) of these messengers is about twice that of the viral genome, sequence homologies must exist between the mRNAs. The position of these homologous regions and the translation products of each of the mRNAs remain to be determined.","publish_time":"1981-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spaan, Willy J.M.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Horzinek, Marian C.; Van Der Zeijst, Bernard A.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31efc556bf4377e23d851a5d24831f62853a9564.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682281904499; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682281904499","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA present","virus-specific RNA synthesis","RNA species","hr pi","Synthesis of virus","breakdown of RNA","virus-specific RNAs present","Release of virus","infected cells","kinetics of virus production","polyribosomes","RNA1","EDTA-resistant particles","mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","MHV-A59","messengers","EDTA treatment","subgenomic mRNAs","viral genome","defective interfering particles","culture medium started","following molecular weights","total molecular mass","infection","Sac","electrophoresis","presence","\u03BCg","material","homologous regions","uridine","high titered stocks","one-step growth experiments","translation products","sequence homologies","multiplicity","incorporation","remainder","glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide","maximum rate","cellulose","actinomycin D","Artifacts","PFU","daltons","oligo","ribonucleoprotein","period","agarose gels","position","Immunofluorescence","RNA2","RNA3","RNA4","RNA5","RNA6","RNA7"],"language":"en"},

CPEs provide naked eye detection possibility by their superior optical properties however, as concentration of target analytes decrease, trace amounts of nucleic acid typically yield colorimetric responses that are not readily perceivable by naked eye. Herein, we report a pixelated analysis approach for correlating colorimetric responses of CPE with nucleic acid concentrations down to 1 nM, in plasma samples, utilizing a smart phone with an algorithm that can perform analytical testing and data processing. The detection strategy employed relies on conformational transitions between single stranded nucleic acid-cationic CPE duplexes and double stranded nucleic acid-CPE triplexes that yield distinct colorimetric responses for enabling naked eye detection of nucleic acids. Cationic poly[N,N,N-triethyl-3-((4-methylthiophen-3-yl)oxy)propan-1-aminium bromide] is utilized as the CPE reporter deposited on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for nucleic acid assay. A smart phone application is developed to capture and digitize the colorimetric response of the individual pixels of the digital images of CPE on the PVDF membrane, followed by an analysis using the algorithm. The proposed pixelated approach enables precise quantification of nucleic acid assay concentrations, thereby eliminating the margin of error involved in conventional methodologies adopted for interpretation of colorimetric responses, for instance, RGB analysis. The obtained results illustrate that a ubiquitous smart phone could be utilized for point of care colorimetric nucleic acids assays in complex matrices without requiring sophisticated software or instrumentation.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayd\u0131n, Hakan Berk; Cheema, Jamal Ahmed; Ammanath, Gopal; Toklucu, Cihan; Yucel, Muge; \u00D6zenler, Sezer; Palaniappan, Alagappan; Liedberg, Bo; Yildiz, Umit Hakan","journal":"Talanta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5e763d2253a378b85985424e5c3e3bc09d35583.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111824.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120581; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914019312147; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914019312147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31892020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPE","RGB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleic acid concentrations","colorimetric responses of CPE","colorimetric assays","trace amounts of nucleic acid","naked eye detection of nucleic acids","double stranded nucleic acid-CPE triplexes","distinct colorimetric responses","interpretation of colorimetric responses","point of care colorimetric nucleic acids assays","single stranded nucleic acid-cationic CPE duplexes","precise quantification of nucleic acid assay concentrations","CPE reporter","naked eye detection possibility","digital images of CPE","pixelated analysis approach","ubiquitous smart phone","smart phone application","PVDF membrane","detection strategy","N-triethyl","CPEs","RGB analysis","algorithm","proposed pixelated approach","Cationic poly","complex matrices","conformational transitions","superior optical properties","conventional methodologies","individual pixels","concentration of target analytes","polyvinylidene fluoride","instance","nM","sophisticated software","propan","analytical testing","margin of error","plasma samples","reporters","obtained results","data processing","instrumentation","Abstract Conjugated polyelectrolytes","amini bromide","methylthiophen"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: There should be not only a social mobilization to contain the virus, but also a collective effort on behalf of the most vulnerable populations.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00FAnior, Jucier Gon\u00E7alves; de Sales, Jair Paulino; Moreira, Marcial Moreno; Pinheiro, Woneska Rodrigues; Lima, Carlos Kennedy Tavares; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","journal":"Psychiatry Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/915d677b5ee50fa3aeb5da4bc1023bd83c6d464b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b89961962ab67d4c4591a32fda69fbc0c67fc029.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156944.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120307861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353696/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113000; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120307861?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","mental health of refugees","fragile situation of refugees","face","poor nutrition","health care","new coronavirus","pandemic state","poor standards of hygiene","well-known international journals","risk factors common","main international newspapers","shelter","psychiatric illnesses","disruption of sewage disposal","negligible sanitation","lack of access","overcrowding","closed ground","electronic databases","psychological sickness","bureaucracy","public services","different culture","behalf","poverty","PubMed","Scopus","uncertainty","information","studies","collective effort","host country","racism","fear","safety","infection","literature","adaption","difficulties","vulnerable populations","people","social mobilization","Embase","epidemic","BACKGROUND","world"],"language":"en"},

Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.

Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 activity was inhibited by the specific ACE2 inhibitor, DX600 (10 \u03BCm, 99% inhibition), but not by the ACE inhibitor, captopril (10 \u03BCm). Both MS and colorimetric assays showed high ACE activity in plasma and kidney with low levels in brain. To extend these findings, ACE measurements were made in ACE overexpressing mice.

Experimental data regarding airflow patterns were used to validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Using the validated CFD model, we investigated the effects of the airflow vortex structure on contaminant transmission based on quantitative analysis. It was found that the contaminant source located in a vorticity-dominated region was more likely to be \u201Clocked\u201D in the vortex, resulting in higher 62% higher average concentration and 14% longer residual time than that when the source was on a deformation dominated location. The contaminant concentrations also differed between the front and rear parts of the cabin because of different airflow structures. Contaminant released close to the heated manikin face was likely to be transported backward according to its distribution mean position. Based on these results, the air flow patterns inside aircraft cabins can potentially be improved to better control the spread of airborne contaminant.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Fei; Liu, Junjie; Ren, Jianlin; Cao, Xiaodong; Zhu, Yifang","journal":"International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/feb2090f761a95b4dd717451d66dfc893caad268.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094279.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.01.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0017931015303458; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931015303458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airflow patterns","contaminant source","contaminant transmission","contaminant transport","contaminant concentrations","airflow vortex structure","spread of airborne contaminant","air flow patterns","different airflow structures","aircraft cabins","validated CFD model","higher average concentration","Abstract Airborne contaminants","vorticity-dominated region","pathogens","odors","effects","heated manikin face","individual passenger","better control","computational fluid dynamics","CO2","passengers unhealthy","residual time","rear parts","quantitative analysis","results","Experimental data","distribution mean position","deformation","location","study"],"language":"en"},

Rapid microbiological diagnosis ensures appropriate antimicrobial therapy as well as effective implementation of isolation precautions. The ePlex respiratory pathogen panel (RP panel) is a novel molecular biology-based assay, developed by GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA), to be performed within a single cartridge for the diagnosis of 25 respiratory pathogens (viral and bacterial). The objective of this study was to compare the performance of the RP panel with those of laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays, using a variety of previously collected clinical respiratory specimens. A total of 343 clinical specimens as well as 29 external quality assessment (EQA) specimens and 2 different Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolates have been assessed in this study. The RP panel showed an agreement of 97.4% with the real-time PCR assay regarding 464 pathogens found in the clinical specimens. All pathogens present in clinical samples and EQA samples with a threshold cycle (C(T)) value of \u003C30 were detected correctly using the RP panel. The RP panel detected 17 additional pathogens, 7 of which could be confirmed by discrepant testing. In conclusion, this study shows excellent performance of the RP panel in comparison to real-time PCR assays for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The ePlex system provided a large amount of useful diagnostic data within a short time frame, with minimal hands-on time, and can therefore potentially be used for rapid diagnostic sample-to-answer testing, in either a laboratory or a decentralized setting.","publish_time":"2017-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nijhuis, R.

They infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, other mammals, birds, fish, and shrimp. Nidovirus infection starts by binding to a receptor on the cell surface, and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes mediated by one of the major surface glycoproteins. Following genome uncoating, the translation of the two overlapping replicase open reading frames (ORFs) yields two large polyprotein precursors that undergo autoproteolysis to produce the mature nonstructural proteins that eventually assemble into a membrane-bound, replication\u2013transcription complex. The complex, which also contains several cellular proteins, mediates negative-strand RNA synthesis, amplification of the genome RNA, and production of a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs). Whereas nidovirus genome replication proceeds through the synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA, transcription involves the synthesis of subgenome-length, negative-strand templates for mRNA synthesis. In arteriviruses and coronaviruses, and probably bafiniviruses, transcription involves a mechanism of discontinuous negative-strand synthesis (template switch) to equip each subgenomic RNA with a 5\u2032 common leader sequence identical to the genomic 5\u2032 end. Except for the largest torovirus sg RNA, torovirus and ronivirus sgRNAs do not share such a common leader sequence and discontinuous RNA synthesis does not appear to be involved in this case. New nidovirus particles are assembled in the cytoplasm.

The current members are Equine arteritis virus (EAV), Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Because arteriviruses share with coronaviruses a similar genome organization, conserved replicase motifs, and a common genome expression strategy, which includes a mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis to generate multiple subgenomic RNAs, they have been joined in the order Nidovirales. However, arteriviruses differ from coronaviruses in the smaller size of their genomes, the smaller size and morphology of their virions, and the properties of their structural proteins. The arteriviruses each have distinct narrow host ranges but are widely distributed geographically. Transmission of arteriviruses occurs via the respiratory route or via bodily fluids and in all cases their primary target cells are macrophages. The outcomes of infections with the different arteriviruses range from asymptomatic infections that can be either persistent or acute, to abortion, respiratory disease, arteritis, fatal hemorrhagic fever, and poliomyelitis. Mechanisms that are thought to contribute to persistence include masking of the primary neutralization epitope by glycosylation, the generation of neutralization escape variants, infection of macrophages by immune complexes via Fc receptors, and the presence of an immunodominant decoy epitope near the primary neutralizing epitope.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brinton, M.

MS coupled with various chromatography- and affinity-based techniques simplifies the complexity of the signals of the microbial biomarkers and provides more accurate results. Affinity-based methods, including those employing nanotechnology, can be used to concentrate traces of target microorganisms from sample solutions and, thereby, improve detection limits. Approaches combining amplification of nucleic acid targets from pathogens with MS-based detection are alternatives to biomarker analyses. Many data analysis methods, including multivariate analysis and bioinformatics approaches, have been developed for microbial identification. The review concludes with some current clinical applications of MS in the identification and typing of infectious microorganisms, as well as some perspectives.

Drugs that inhibit the ion channel can, therefore, inhibit virus release, and they could be a source for development of novel therapeutic antiviral agents. Various drugs found in Chinese herbs that are well known as anticancer agents also have an antiviral potency. Here we tested the flavonols kaempferol, kaempferol glycosides, and acylated kaempferol glucoside derivatives with respect to their potency to block the 3a channel. We used the Xenopus oocyte with a heterologously expressed 3a protein as a model system to test the efficacy of the flavonols. Some of these drugs turned out to be potent inhibitors of the 3a channel. The most effective one was the glycoside juglanin (carrying an arabinose residue) with an IC(50) value of 2.3 \u00B5M for inhibition of the 3a-mediated current. Kaempferol derivatives with rhamnose residue also seem to be quite effective.

In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll/IL-1 domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03B2 (TRIF), one of the two major TLRs\u2013adaptor molecules, on innate immune response induced by TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation in murine peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs). TRIF was strongly expressed in PMCs and its deficiency led to impaired production of cytokines and chemokines by poly I:C and LPS in the cells. Activation of NF-\u03BAB or MAPKs through poly I:C and LPS stimulation was reduced in TRIF-deficient PMCs as compared to the WT cells. TRIF was also necessary for optimal nitric oxide synthesis and gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IFN-\u03B2 in PMCs in response to poly I:C and LPS. Furthermore, both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced high level of IL-6, CXCL1, and CCL2 production in PMCs, which was significantly impaired by TRIF deficiency.

Adherence of F4 ETEC to the small intestine by binding to specific receptors is mediated by F4 fimbriae. Porcine aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) was recently identified as a new F4 receptor. In this study, 7 coding mutations and 1 mutation in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u0027 UTR)were identified in ANPEP by reverse transcriptase (RT\u2013) PCR and sequencing using 3 F4 receptor-positive (F4R\u002B) and 2 F4 receptor-negative (F4R\u2013) pigs, which were F4 phenotyped based on the MUC4 TaqMan, oral immunization, and the in vitro villous adhesion assay.

In addition, the RT-PCR experiments did not reveal any differential expression or alternative splicing in the small intestine of F4R\u002B and F4R\u2013 pigs.

Improved etiological insight is needed to improve clinical management and prevention. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a three-year prospective descriptive study of severe respiratory illness among children from 2 months to 13 years of age within the largest referral hospital for infectious diseases in southern Vietnam. METHODS: Molecular detection for 15 viral species and subtypes was performed on three types of respiratory specimens (nose, throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates) using a multiplex RT-PCR kit (Seeplex\u2122 RV detection, Seegene) and additional monoplex real-time RT-PCRs. RESULTS: A total of 309 children were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2008. Viruses were identified in 72% (222/309) of cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (24%), influenza virus A and B (17%), human bocavirus (16%), enterovirus (9%), human coronavirus (8%), human metapneumovirus (7%), parainfluenza virus 1\u20133 (6%), adenovirus (5%), and human rhinovirus A (4%). Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 20% (62/309) of patients. When combined, diagnostic yields in nose and throat swabs were similar to nasopharyngeal aspirates. CONCLUSION: Similar to other parts in the world, RSV and influenza were the predominant viral pathogens detected in Vietnamese hospitalized children. Combined nasal and throat swabs are the specimens of choice for sensitive molecular detection of a broad panel of viral agents. Further research is required to better understand the clinical significance of single versus multiple viral coinfections and to address the role of bacterial (co-)infections involved in severe respiratory illness.","publish_time":"2011-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Do, Anh Ha Lien; van Doorn, H.

Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated by in vivo homologous recombination of the insertion vector with the WR strain of vaccinia virus. Nucleoprotein (N) expressed by both recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV had a relative molecular mass (M r) of 47,000 and was susceptible to degradation at the C-terminus yielding discrete breakdown products. The integral membrane protein (M) expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV was sensitive to endogly-cosidase H reducing the mature polypeptide of M r 29,000 to a species of M r 27,000. Expression of M by recombinant vaccinia virus was inhibited during early infection due to a cryptic vaccinia virus transcriptional termination signal within the TGEV coding sequence.

Antisera from mice infected with recombinant viruses immunoprecipitated specific TGEV antigens from lysates of TGEV infected cells but had little significant TGEV neutralising activity in vitro.","publish_time":"1991-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pulford, David J.; Britton, Paul","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/242dfe072f6315d63c08adb4be1b17242a0fda2b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016817029190019R; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817029190019R","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Recombinant vaccinia viruses","recombinant vaccinia virus infected cells","vaccinia virus insertion vector","vaccinia P","WR strain of vaccinia virus","recombinant viruses","lysates of TGEV infected cells","cryptic vaccinia virus transcriptional termination signal","specific TGEV antigens","TGEV coding sequence","significant TGEV neutralising activity","Abstract Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus","nucleoprotein","expression","integral membrane protein genes","pGS20","endogly-cosidase H","early infection","C-terminus","control","relative molecular mass","mature polypeptide","correct orientation","homologous recombination","discrete breakdown products","mice","cell cytoplasm","degradation","Antisera","Indirect immunofluorescence","promoter","species"],"language":"en"},

Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China. METHODS: The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (\u226510 minutes within 2 meters). Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), \u22651 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scott, Sarah E; Zabel, Karen; Collins, Jennifer; Hobbs, Katherine C; Kretschmer, Melissa J; Lach, Mitchell; Turnbow, Katie; Speck, Lindsay; White, Jessica R; Maldonado, Keila; Howard, Brandon; Fowler, Jeanene; Singh, Sonia; Robinson, Susan; Pompa, Alexandra Peterson; Chatham-Stephens, Kevin; Xie, Amy; Cates, Jordan; Lindstrom, Stephen; Lu, Xiaoyan; Rolfes, Melissa A; Flanagan, Marcy; Sunenshine, Rebecca","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cdcc5deccd64ca480c5ad7ff5aa537e96ed14bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240285/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa374","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","NP/OP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["High-risk contacts","SARS-CoV","positive specimens","close contacts","OP specimens","Mild illness","Paired case NP","prolonged case contact","Medium-risk contacts","high-risk exposure","tested negative","high-risk contact NP","days","pairs","case diagnostic specimen collection","illness severity correlates","range of illness severity","positive tests","medium-risk exposure","Coronavirus disease","intimate contact","testing","diagnosis","public health strategies","public health investigation","asymptomatic infection","Disease Control","non-hospitalized COVID","multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Maricopa County resident","individuals","CDC","Prevention","Centers","personal protective equipment","evidence of transmission","infectivity","minutes","RESULTS","interactions","data","BACKGROUND","report","total","time points","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","persons","meters","China"],"language":"en"},

We posit that the emergence of multiantibiotic-resistant strains will jeopardize current treatments in these regions. Deaths arising from secondary infections are more often associated with acute lung injury, a common consequence of hypercytokinemia, than with the infection per se. Given that secondary bacterial pneumonia often has a poor prognosis, newer approaches to improve treatment outcomes are urgently needed to reduce the high levels of morbidity and mortality. Using a sequential dual-infection mouse model of secondary bacterial lung infection, we show that host-directed therapy via immunoneutralization of the angiopoietin-like 4 c-isoform (cANGPTL4) reduced pulmonary edema and damage in infected mice. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that anti-cANGPTL4 treatment improved immune and coagulation functions and reduced internal bleeding and edema. Importantly, anti-cANGPTL4 antibody, when used concurrently with either conventional antibiotics or antipneumolysin antibody, prolonged the median survival of mice compared to monotherapy.

Among 1779 bat samples collected in China, diverse coronaviruses were detected in 32 samples from five different bat species by RT-PCR. Two novel alphacoronaviruses, Rhinolophus sinicus bat coronavirus HKU32 (Rs-BatCoV HKU32) and Tylonycteris robustula bat coronavirus HKU33 (Tr-BatCoV HKU33), were discovered from Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong and greater bamboo bats in Guizhou Province, respectively. Genome analyses showed that Rs-BatCoV HKU32 is closely related to BatCoV HKU10 and related viruses from diverse bat families, whereas Tr-BatCoV HKU33 is closely related to BtNv-AlphaCoV and similar viruses exclusively from bats of Vespertilionidae family. The close relatedness of Rs-BatCoV HKU32 to BatCoV HKU10 which was also detected in Pomona roundleaf bats from the same country park suggests that these viruses may have the tendency of infecting genetically distant bat populations of close geographical proximity with subsequent genetic divergence. Moreover, the presence of SARSr-CoV ORF7a-like protein in Rs-BatCoV HKU32 suggests a common evolutionary origin of this accessory protein with SARS-CoV, also from Chinese horseshoe bats, an apparent reservoir for coronavirus epidemics.

Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins constitute a family of viral restriction factors that can inhibit the replication of several types of viruses. Our previous study showed that overexpression of swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) impeded replication of the FMD virus (FMDV) in BHK-21 cells and mice. In this study, sIFITM3-transgenic (TG) pigs were produced by handmade cloning. Results showed that sIFITM3 was highly overexpressed in many organs of sIFITM3-TG pigs compared to wild-type pigs. After a virulent FMDV strain (O/ES/2001) was intramuscularly inoculated, the sIFITM3-TG pigs showed slightly higher susceptibility to FMDV infection than wild-type pigs. Both groups displayed comparable degrees of clinical symptoms throughout the 14-day observation period. Therefore, the induction of systemic sIFITM3 expression does not protect pigs against FMDV infection. Based on these observations, we propose that a combination of interferons and vaccines be used to control FMDV infections and subsequent FMD outbreaks.","publish_time":"2016-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Huawei; Zheng, Haixue; Qian, Ping; Xu, Jinfang; Yang, Xi; Zhou, Rui; Chen, Huanchun; Li, Xiangmin","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f67c9834d5a45ed8013004c1ee4de7322bf98c90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126902.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.05.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351630147X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27374903/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351630147X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sIFITM3-TG pigs","organs of sIFITM3","sIFITM3-transgenic","wild-type pigs","FMDV infections","virulent FMDV strain","induction of systemic sIFITM3 expression","FMD virus","subsequent FMD outbreaks","impeded replication","mouth disease","previous study","contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals","higher susceptibility","overexpression of swine IFITM3","proteins","BHK","comparable degrees of clinical symptoms","family of viral restriction factors","groups","vaccines","severe economic loss","day observation period","Abstract Foot","cells","combination of interferons","handmade cloning","mice","types of viruses","Results","observations"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the autocrine activation of BALB/c and A/J M\u03A6, we activated them with interleukin-12 (IL-12) and/or IL-18, and quantified IFN\u03B3 production, the anti-MHV3 state and arginine metabolism. Synergistic activation by IL-12/IL-18 induced the expression of the IFN\u03B3 gene in M\u03A6 from both mouse strains. In bone marrow (BM) or peritoneal (P) M\u03A6 of specific pathogen-free (spf) mice of both strains, IFN\u03B3 synthesis occurred only with a synergistic IL-12/IL-18 activation and showed increasing levels from 24 to 72h of activation. In contrast, when non-spf mice were used in the assay, their PM\u03A6 synthesized higher IFN\u03B3 levels upon activation with only IL-12 or only IL-18 or both. The BALB/c M\u03A6 were always capable of synthesizing higher amounts of IFN\u03B3 than the A/J M\u03A6. An anti-MHV3 state was observed only in A/J M\u03A6 upon activation with IL-12/IL-18 or IFN\u03B3 regardless of their origin from the peritoneum or bone marrow. Arginine metabolism in activated and/or virus infected BMM\u03A6 was investigated through nitric oxide (NO) and arginase induction as well as the consumption of arginine and synthesis of citrulline, ornithine and spermine. The results showed that both BALB/c and A/J BMM\u03A6 populations released NO only after activation with IL-12/IL-18 or IFN\u03B3. Arginase was not induced in BMM\u03A6 from both strains by IL-12/IL-18 or IFN\u03B3 but only by IL-4/IL-10. Higher arginine consumption was observed in BMM\u03A6 from both strains upon activation with IL-4 or IFN\u03B3 which further increased, in this case, when the cells were infected with MHV3. As a consequence of nitric oxide synthase synthesis and arginine consumption in IFN\u03B3 activated BMM\u03A6, we observed a higher synthesis of citrulline. High levels of ornithine were induced only upon IL-4 activation. Polyamine synthesis was higher in A/J BMM\u03A6 than in BALB/c ones, which correlated with the slightly lower levels of ornithine observed. Upon infection with MHV3, we observed a higher synthesis of spermine. IL-12/IL-18 or IFN\u03B3 activation, mainly in MHV3 infected cells, led to a decreased synthesis of polyamines, notably spermine, only in A/J BMM\u03A6.

While poly(I:C) is an excellent agonist for TLR3 in several cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, viral dsRNAs tend to be poor agonists, leading to the hypothesis that additional factor(s) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral dsRNAs. TLR3 signaling was examined in a lung epithelial cell line by quantifying cytokine production and in human embryonic kidney cells by quantifying luciferase reporter levels. Recombinant 1b hepatitis C virus polymerase was found to enhance TLR3 signaling in the lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells when added to the media along with either poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. The polymerase from the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV was a poor enhancer of TLR3 signaling until it was mutated to favor a conformation that could bind better to a partially duplexed RNA. The 1b polymerase also co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. RNA-binding capsid proteins (CPs) from two positive-strand RNA viruses and the hepadenavirus hepatitis B virus (HBV) were also potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. A truncated version of the HBV CP that lacked an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain was unable to enhance TLR3 signaling.

The limitations of the use of aluminium salts that are unable to elicite cell responses against intracellular pathogens such as those causing malaria, tuberculosis, or AIDS, have driven the development of new alternative adjuvants such as QS-21, a triterpene saponin purified from Quillaja saponaria. PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to attempt to clarify the mechanism of action of QS-21 through either receptors or signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo with special emphasis on the co-administration with other immunostimulants in new adjuvant formulations, called adjuvant systems (AS). Furthermore, the most relevant clinical applications will be presented. METHODS: A literature search covering the period 2014\u20132018 was performed using electronic databases from Sci finder, Science direct, Medline/Pubmed, Scopus, Google scholar. RESULTS: Insights into the mechanism of action of QS-21 can be summarized as follows: 1) in vivo stimulation of Th2 humoral and Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through action on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T cells, leading to release of Th1 cytokines participating in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. 2) activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse APCs with subsequent release of caspase-1 dependent cytokines, Il-1\u03B2 and Il-18, important for Th1 responses. 3) synthesis of nearly 50 QS-21 analogs, allowing structure/activity relationships and mechanistic studies. 4) unique synergy mechanism between monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL A) and QS-21, formulated in a liposome (AS01) in the early IFN-\u03B3 response, promoting vaccine immunogenicity. The second part of the review is related to phase I-III clinical trials of QS-21, mostly formulated in ASs, to evaluate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of adjuvanted prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases, e.g. malaria, herpes zoster, tuberculosis, AIDS and therapeutic vaccines against cancer and Alzheimer\u0027s disease. CONCLUSION: The most advanced phase III clinical applications led to the development of two vaccines containing QS-21 as part of the AS, the Herpes Zoster vaccine (HZ/su) (Shingrix\u2122) which received a license in 2017 from the FDA and a marketing authorization in the EU in 2018 and the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix\u2122) against malaria, which was approved by the EMA in 2015 for further implementation in Sub-Saharan countries for routine use.","publish_time":"2019-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lacaille-Dubois, Marie-Aleth","journal":"Phytomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2311677b6bab8221ee5d403f9f5de32fad8ec229.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127804.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2019.152905; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711319300753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182297/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711319300753","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Quillaja","Google","FDA","EU","EMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical trials of QS","Th1 responses","vaccine immunogenicity","malaria","AS01 vaccine","Vaccine adjuvants","mechanism of action","Herpes Zoster vaccine","Th1 cell","immune responses","release of Th1 cytokines","therapeutic vaccines","elicite cell responses","AIDS","tuberculosis","relevant clinical applications","review","development of new alternative adjuvants","new adjuvant formulations","co-administered antigen","elimination of intracellular pathogens","unique synergy mechanism","mouse APCs","safety of adjuvanted prophylactic vaccines","co-administration","dependent cytokines","T cells","adjuvant systems","routine use","advanced phase","subsequent release of caspase","use of aluminium salts","early IFN-\u03B3 response","Medline","Science direct","infectious diseases","Pubmed","Sci finder","structure","NLRP3 inflammasome","implementation","activity relationships","Scopus","Sub-Saharan countries","monophosphoryl lipid","cancer","immunostimulants","HZ","electronic databases","stimulation of Th2 humoral","mechanistic studies","special emphasis","efficacy","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","triterpene saponin","analogs","RTS","Mosquirix","Google scholar","literature search","FDA","marketing authorization","pathways","Quillaja saponaria","Shingrix","activation","limitations","BACKGROUND","compounds","Insights","METHODS","period","license","PURPOSE","aim","liposome","CONCLUSION","ASs","RESULTS","receptors","EMA","synthesis"],"language":"en"},

It accurately identified 63 FMDV strains belonging to all seven serotypes and showed no cross\u2010reactivity with viruses causing similar clinical diseases in cloven\u2010hoofed animals. The assay was able to identify FMDV RNA in multiple sample types including oral, nasal and lesion swabs, epithelial tissue suspensions, vesicular and oral fluid samples, even before the appearance of clinical signs. Clinical sensitivity of the assay was comparable or slightly higher than the laboratory\u2010based real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay in use.

Combining with published studies, this work reveals that Gammaproteobacteria may be a dominant class in the whole Chiroptera and Fusobacteria is less observed in bats although it has been proven to be dominant in other mammals.

A new influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) virus emerged in April 2009, proceeded to spread worldwide, and was designated as an influenza pandemic. A/H1N1 viruses had circulated in 1918\u20131957 and 1977\u20132009 and were in the annual vaccine during 1977\u20132009. Methods. Serum antibody to the pH1N1 and seasonal A/H1N1 viruses was measured in 579 healthy adults at enrollment (fall 2009) and after surveillance for illness (spring 2010). Subjects reporting with moderate to severe acute respiratory illness had illness and virus quantitation for 1 week; evaluations for missed illnesses were conducted over holiday periods and at the spring 2010 visit. Results. After excluding 66 subjects who received pH1N1 vaccine, 513 remained. Seventy-seven had reported with moderate to severe illnesses; 31 were infected with pH1N1 virus, and 30 with a rhinovirus. Determining etiology from clinical findings was not possible, but fever and prominent myalgias favored influenza and prominent rhinorrhea favored rhinovirus. Tests of fall and spring antibody indicated pH1N1 infection of 23% had occurred, with the rate decreasing with increasing anti-pH1N1 antibody; a similar pattern was seen for influenza-associated illness. A reducing frequency of pH1N1 infections was also seen with increasing antibody to the recent seasonal A/H1N1 virus (A/Brisbane/59/07). Preexisting antibody to pH1N1 virus, responses to a single vaccine dose, a low infection-to-illness ratio, and a short duration of illness and virus shedding among those with influenza indicated presence of considerable preexisting immunity to pH1N1 in the population. Conclusions. The 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic among healthy adults was relatively mild, most likely because of immunity from prior infections with A/H1N1 viruses.","publish_time":"2011-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Couch, Robert B.; Atmar, Robert L.; Franco, Luis M.; Quarles, John M.; Ni\u00F1o, Diane; Wells, Janet M.; Arden, Nancy; Cheung, Sheree; Belmont, John W.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3258274.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3258274?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22075792/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir809","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pH1N1 virus","pH1N1 vaccine","H1N1 viruses","increasing anti-pH1N1 antibody","influenza-associated illness","spring antibody","increasing antibody","Preexisting antibody","illness ratio","virus quantitation","H1N1 epidemic","reducing frequency of pH1N1 infections","Serum antibody","new influenza","influenza pandemic","short duration of illness","severe acute respiratory illness","healthy adults","severe illnesses","annual vaccine","Subjects","rhinovirus","single vaccine dose","prominent myalgias","prominent rhinorrhea","low infection","prior infections","presence of considerable preexisting immunity","Tests of fall","responses","similar pattern","fever","week","evaluations","rate","clinical findings","holiday periods","etiology","population","visit","enrollment","surveillance","Brisbane","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the isolated 27 strains together with 29 strains published in Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except for one isolated and one published were clustered into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch without new predominant strains, whereas all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V that is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. The study of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 different cleavage motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 motifs unique to isolated strains, and 7 motifs unique to published strains, further bolstering the notion of no new predominant strains. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions are polymorphic and diverse, showing no sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. Taken together, there was no predominant new strain circulating in South China during 2004\u20132008. Nonetheless, circulating IBV strains have been continuously evolving with genetic compositions distant from vaccine strains; this explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks in commercial flocks in South China during 2004\u20132008. Furthermore, in order to safe guard against the sudden emergence of new predominant strains, continuing surveillance of IBV strains circulating in the field is of extreme importance.","publish_time":"2010-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Linlin; Xue, Chunyi; Chen, Feng; Qin, Jianping; Xie, Qingmei; Bi, Yingzuo; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1cf663db75ada47e11d978212ba62c83baba559.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117290.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509005719; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509005719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022714/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["South China"],"keyphrases":["isolated strains","published strains","vaccine strains","continuing surveillance of IBV strains","sudden emergence of new predominant strains","strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus","predominant new strain","South China","motifs unique","different cleavage motifs","S1 gene sequences","S1 amino acid sequences","S1 protein","sign of predominant genetic changes","Phylogenetic analysis","distinct genotypes","amino acid substitutions","genetic compositions distant","Alignment analysis","different chicken farms","protease cleavage motif","big phylogenetic branch","commercial flocks","diseased chickens","infrequent outbreaks","deletions","insertions","safe guard","genotype V","field","notion","order","study","Genbank","extreme importance"],"language":"en"},

This review centers on known viral interactions with protein deubiquitination, on viral enzymes for which deubiquitinating activities were recently demonstrated, and on the roles of viral ubiquitin-like sequences.","publish_time":"2007-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindner, Holger A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7aa391707851c37e025064bf9bf24a56e1debe2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103280.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206009202; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206009202","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of viral ubiquitin","viral interactions","protein deubiquitination","viral enzymes","viral target","protein ubiquitination","residue protein","various cellular activities","importance of deubiquitination","various ways","deubiquitinating activities","major regulatory mechanism","Abstract Post-translational modification of proteins","peptides","advantage","modifiers","review centers","evidence","sequences","Eukaryotic viruses","time"],"language":"en"},

The lack of success in vaccine development and the emergence of drug resistance to commonly used drugs emphasize the urgent need for alternative antivirals against HSV-2 infection. Arbidol (ARB) has been demonstrated to be a broad spectrum antiviral drug that exhibits immunomodulatory properties that affect the HSV-2 life cycle. This study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of ARB against HSV-2 in vivo and in vitro to further explore the clinical application of ARB. METHODS: The efficacy of ARB on HSV-2 infection in vitro was examined by CPE and MTT assays. A vaginitis model was established to monitor changes in histopathology and inflammatory cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03B1 and TGF-\u03B2) expression by H\u0026E staining and ELISA, respectively, and the efficacy of ARB was evaluated accordingly. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the ratio of CD4(\u002B)/CD8(\u002B) T cells in the peripheral blood of the vaginitis animals. Considering the balance of efficacy and pharmacokinetics, ARB ointment was strictly prepared to observe formulation efficacy differences compared to the oral dosing form. RESULTS: The results showed that, in vitro, the TC(50) and IC(50) of ARB were 32.32 \u03BCg/mL and 4.77 \u03BCg/mL (SI = 6.82), respectively, indicating that ARB presents effective activity against HSV-2 in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the time-course assay suggested that 25 \u03BCg/mL ARB affected the late stage of HSV-2 replication. However, ARB did not inhibit viral attachment or cell penetration. The in vivo results showed that ARB ointment can improve the survival rate, prolong the survival time and reduce the reproductive tract injury in mice infected with HSV-2, regulate cytokine expression; and balance the CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T lymphocyte ratio in the peripheral blood to participate in the regulation of immune response. CONCLUSION: ARB showed anti-HSV-2 activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and played a role in inhibiting the late replication cycle of the virus. The vaginitis model was successfully established, according to immunomodulation outcomes, responded better to ARB in ointment form than in oral form.","publish_time":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Qiuling; Gu, Zhen; Leneva, Irina; Jiang, Haiming; Li, Runfeng; Deng, Liehua; Yang, Zifeng","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daa4e66ddefb072e4f86614c871c1fe2ddd3b178.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2018.09.043; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576918307495; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576918307495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARB","CPE","MTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacy of ARB","ARB ointment","mechanism of ARB","anti-HSV","clinical application of ARB","late stage of HSV","RESULTS","balance of efficacy","ointment form","\u03BCg","oral form","HIV infection","vaginitis model","formulation efficacy differences","peripheral blood","survival time","cytokine expression","IL","oral dosing form","late replication cycle","CD8","ratio of CD4","dose-dependent manner","vaginitis animals","T lymphocyte ratio","survival rate","T cells","used drugs","inflammatory cytokine","effective activity","life cycle","emergence of drug resistance","time-course assay","broad spectrum antiviral drug","urgent need","vaccine development","TGF-\u03B2","immunomodulatory properties","alternative antivirals","reproductive tract injury","changes","role","E staining","TNF-\u03B1","histopathology","ELISA","mice","viral attachment","pharmacokinetics","lack of success","cell penetration","CPE","cervical cancer","virus","CONCLUSION","regulation of immune response","MTT assays","recent years","study","immunomodulation outcomes","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","flow cytometry","Arbidol"],"language":"en"},

This chronic CHIKV infection can severely incapacitate patients for weeks up to several years after the initial infection.

A statistical difference was not found when comparing pig populations which were vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine followed by a triple challenge and pigs vaccinated with monovalent M hyopneumoniae vaccine followed by mycoplasmal single challenge in the following areas: M. hyopneumoniae nasal shedding, the number of M. hyopneumoniae-specific interferon-\u03B3 secreting cells (IFN-\u03B3-SC), and mycoplasmal lung lesion scores. Pigs vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine mixture followed by a triple challenge resulted in a similar reduction of PCV2 viremia, an increase in the number of PCV2-specific IFN-\u03B3-SC and reduction in interstitial lung lesion scores when compared to pigs vaccinated with a PCV-2 vaccine and challenged with PCV2 only.

METHODS: A PubMed database search was performed for studies of non-infectious sore throat. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Non-infectious causes of sore throat include: physico-chemical factors, such as smoking, snoring, shouting, tracheal intubation, medications, or concomitant illness; and environmental factors including indoor and outdoor air pollutants, temperature and humidity, and hazardous or occupational irritants. The pathophysiology underlying non-infectious sore throat is largely uncharacterised, although neurogenic inflammation looks to be a promising candidate. It is likely that there will be individual disposition factors or the coincidence of more than one irritant with possible\u2014up to now unknown\u2014interactions between them.

There is a lack of effective methods to predict indoor contaminant distribution primarily because of uncertainty of the contaminant concentration in supply air which in turn due to the mixing ratio of fresh and recirculation air. In this paper, a versatile numerical method to determine the pollutant distribution of ventilation system with recirculation at steady state is proposed based on typical ventilation systems with accessibility of supply air (ASA) and accessibility of contaminant source (ACS). The relationship is established between contaminant concentrations of supply air and return air in a ventilated room or zone. The concentrations of supply air and contaminant distribution in each room can be determined using such parameters as ASA and ACS. The proposed method is validated by both experimental data and numerical simulation result. The computing speed of the proposed method is compared with the iteration method. The comparisons between the proposed method and the lumped parameter model are also conducted.

Their cultivation using agro-industrial wastes and wastewater (WaW) is of particular interest in the context of a circular economy, not only for recycling valuable nutrients but also for reducing the requirements for fresh water for the production of biomass. Recovery and recycling of nutrients is an unavoidable long-term approach for securing future food and feed production. Agro-industrial WaW are rich in nutrients and have been widely considered as a potential nutrient source for the cultivation of microalgae/duckweed. However, they commonly contain various hazardous contaminants, which could potentially taint the produced biomass, raising various concerns about the safety of their consumption. Herein, an overview of the most important contaminants, including heavy metals and metalloids, pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites etc.), and xenobiotics (hormones, antibiotics, parasiticides etc.) is given. It is concluded that pretreatment and processing of WaW is a requisite step for the removal of several contaminants. Among the various technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used in practice and offers a technologically mature approach for WaW treatment. During AD, various organic and biological contaminants are significantly removed. Further removal of contaminants could be achieved by post-treatment and processing of digestates (solid/liquid separation, dilution etc.) to further decrease the concentration of contaminants. Moreover, during cultivation an additional removal may occur through various mechanisms, such as precipitation, degradation, and biotransformation. Since many jurisdictions regulate the presence of various contaminants in feed or food setting strict safety monitoring processes, it would be of particular interest to initiate a multi-disciplinary discussion whether agro-industrial WaW ought to be used to cultivate microalgae/duckweed for feed or food production and identify most feasible options for doing this safely. Based on the current body of knowledge it is estimated that AD and post-treatment of WaW can lower significantly the risks associated with heavy metals and pathogens, but it is yet unclear to what extent this is the case for certain persistent xenobiotics.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Markou, Giorgos; Wang, Liang; Ye, Jianfeng; Unc, Adrian","journal":"Biotechnol Adv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6faf47871568147bcf658dcb932ca7e56d886f20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125918.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2018.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673973/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0734975018300752; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975018300752","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WaW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["removal of contaminants","presence of various contaminants","various hazardous contaminants","WaW treatment","Agro-industrial WaW","processing of WaW","important contaminants","biological contaminants","concentration of contaminants","post-treatment of WaW","food production","feed production","various mechanisms","various concerns","production of biomass","various technologies","cultivation of microalgae","duckweed","production of protein","rich biomass","recycling of nutrients","agro-industrial wastes","future food","pathogens","heavy metals","recycling valuable nutrients","produced biomass","potential source","additional removal","potential nutrient source","processing of digestates","mature approach","unavoidable long-term approach","certain persistent xenobiotics","strict safety monitoring processes","high-value compounds","fatty acids","metalloids","multi-disciplinary discussion","pigments","Spirulina","bacteria","wastewater","liquid separation","requisite step","case","viruses","Dunalliela","Chlorella","Tetrasselmis","Arthrospira","parasites","precipitation","fresh water","requirements","anaerobic digestion","risks","circular economy","extent","degradation","dilution","vitamins","hormones","antibiotics","parasiticides","context","Lemna","Wolffia","practice","feasible options","jurisdictions","Aquatic organisms","current body of knowledge","biotransformation","consumption","overview","Recovery","pretreatment"],"language":"en"},

Trp53 knockout mouse models have been widely used in cancer etiology studies and in search for a cure of cancer with some limitations that other model organisms might help overcome. Via pronuclear microinjection of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), we created a Tp53 knockout rat that contains an 11-bp deletion in exon 3, resulting in a frameshift and premature terminations in the open reading frame. In cohorts of 25 homozygous (Tp53(\u039411/\u039411)), 37 heterozygous (Tp53(\u039411/\u002B)) and 30 wild-type rats, the Tp53(\u039411/\u039411) rats lived an average of 126 days before death or removal from study because of clinical signs of abnormality or formation of tumors. Half of Tp53(\u039411/\u002B) were removed from study by 1 year of age because of tumor formation. Both Tp53(\u039411/\u002B) and Tp53(\u039411/\u039411) rats developed a wide spectrum of tumors, most commonly sarcomas. Interestingly, there was a strikingly high incidence of brain lesions, especially in Tp53(\u039411/\u039411) animals.

Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. METHODS: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy. CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.

We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. AIM: To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. METHODS: 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. RESULTS: Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings. By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19. Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic. Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xuebing; Lin, Hong; Jiang, Haifeng; Li, Ruihua; Zhong, Na; Su, Hang; Li, Yi; Zhao, Min","journal":"Gen Psychiatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07c27a20b3ea323b80e5283274e941aad040fb9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204789.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420523/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan","Yichang"],"keyphrases":["suspected patients","suspected COVID","hospitalised psychiatric patients","symptoms of COVID","suspected group","outbreak of COVID","clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients","clinical features of hospitalised patients","schizophrenia","clean group","mental symptoms","chest CT results","independent isolation ward","general ward","mental health hospital","detection of abnormal chest CT findings","Hubei Province","China","psychiatric medications adjustment","onset of respiratory symptoms","higher stress","laboratory findings","increased stress","sleep disturbances","confirmed cases","poorer sleep quality","anxiety levels","depression","Wuhan","mood","diagnostic criteria","SD","abnormalities","data","comprehensive investigation","reverse transcription PCR tests","mean age","Yichang","Medical records","METHODS","CONCLUSION","AIM","spread","BACKGROUND","groups","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

To interfere with propagation, viral enzymatic activities are considered potential targets. Here we addressed the function of the viral macrodomains, conserved folds of non-structural proteins of many (\u002B)ssRNA viruses. Macrodomains are closely associated with ADP-ribose function and metabolism. ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification controlling various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription and stress response. We found that the viral macrodomains possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD10 (aka PARP15, PARP14 and PARP10, respectively), reverting this post-translational modification both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, the viral macrodomains possess only weak activity towards poly-ADP-ribose chains synthesized by ARTD1 (aka PARP1). Unlike poly-ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase, which hydrolyzes poly-ADP-ribose chains to individual ADP-ribose units but cannot cleave the amino acid side chain - ADP-ribose bond, the different viral macrodomains release poly-ADP-ribose chains with distinct efficiency. Mutational and structural analyses identified key amino acids for hydrolase activity of the Chikungunya viral macrodomain. Moreover, ARTD8 and ARTD10 are induced by innate immune mechanisms, suggesting that the control of mono-ADP-ribosylation is part of a host-pathogen conflict.","publish_time":"2017-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eckei, Laura; Krieg, Sarah; B\u00FCtepage, Mareike; Lehmann, Anne; Gross, Annika; Lippok, Barbara; Grimm, Alexander R.; K\u00FCmmerer, Beate M.; Rossetti, Giulia; L\u00FCscher, Bernhard; Verheugd, Patricia","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad8462ee6be4cf7ab5b17b2b81c713879c599a73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5288732.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28150709/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep41746","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mutational"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mono-ADP","ADP-ribosylation","ADP-ribose function","chain - ADP","individual ADP-ribose units","different viral macrodomains release poly-ADP","ribose chains","ribose bond","Chikungunya viral macrodomain","viral enzymatic activities","broad hydrolase activity","weak activity","control of mono","post-translational modification","ARTD10","ARTD8","ssRNA viruses","Chikungunya virus","key amino acids","various cellular processes","DNA repair","structural analyses","Human pathogenic positive single strand RNA","ribosylated substrates","conserved folds of non-structural proteins","transcription","severe health problems","ribosyltransferases ARTD7","efficient vaccines","stress response","PARP15","potential targets","distinct efficiency","ribosylglycohydrolase","therapeutic strategies","PARP14","immune mechanisms","propagation","metabolism","host-pathogen conflict","PARP10","cells","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Molecular modeling and experimental approaches are being used to identify and develop inhibitors of human DNMTs. Most of the computational efforts conducted so far with DNMT1 employ homology models of the enzyme. Recently, a crystallographic structure of the methyltransferase domain of human DNMT1 bound to unmethylated DNA was published. Following on our previous computational and experimental studies with DNMTs, we herein present molecular dynamics of the crystal structure of human DNMT1. Docking studies of established DNMT1 inhibitors with the crystal structure gave rise to a structure-based pharmacophore model that suggests key interactions of the inhibitors with the catalytic binding site. Results had a good agreement with the docking and pharmacophore models previously developed using a homology model of the catalytic domain of DNMT1. The docking protocol was able to distinguish active DNMT1 inhibitors from, for example, experimentally known inactive DNMT1 inhibitors. As part of our efforts to identify novel inhibitors of DNMT1, we conducted the experimental characterization of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) that in preliminary docking studies showed promising activity. ATA had a sub-micromolar inhibition (IC(50) = 0.68 \u03BCM) against DNMT1. ATA was also evaluated for Dnmt3a inhibition showing an IC(50) = 1.4 \u03BCM. This chapter illustrates the synergy from integrating molecular modeling and experimental methods for further advance the discovery of novel candidates for epigenetic therapies.","publish_time":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoo, Jakyung; Kim, Joo Hee; Robertson, Keith D.; Medina-Franco, Jos\u00E9 L.","journal":"Advances in Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc1b3d0d90b3b894d0ca5e2b219b8b44774001db.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ea0b720108cd092d65cb22c50c2e741501c0b65e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3837394.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22607757/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123983121000081; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-398312-1.00008-1; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123983121000081; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3837394?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel inhibitors of DNMT1","inactive DNMT1 inhibitors","studies of established DNMT1 inhibitors","crystal structure of human DNMT1","catalytic domain of DNMT1","inhibitors of human DNMTs","methyltransferase domain of human DNMT1","experimental studies","preliminary docking studies","crystallographic structure","experimental methods","experimental approaches","Molecular modeling","docking protocol","structure-based pharmacophore model","pharmacophore models","homology models","computational efforts","\u03BCM","experimental characterization of aurintricarboxylic acid","promising epigenetic targets","present molecular dynamics","discovery of novel candidates","development of novel anticancer drugs","epigenetic therapies","promising activity","Dnmt3a inhibition","DNA methyltransferases","unmethylated DNA","sub-micromolar inhibition","catalytic binding site","rise","example","key interactions","good agreement","synergy","diseases","enzyme","Results","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, emerging evidence shows that an uncontrolled coagulation system, including both the cellular (endothelial cells and platelets) and protein (coagulation factors, anticoagulants and fibrinolysis proteases) components, contributes to the pathogenesis of influenza by augmenting viral replication and immune pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms of the dysfunctional coagulatory response in the pathogenesis of IAV.","publish_time":"2016-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yan; Tang, Hong","journal":"Cellular \u0026 Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0adf2e22eefb4ea5e395462e2bc6713b43fd320c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4947825.xml.json","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20161.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27041635/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2016.1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Dysfunctional coagulation","pathogenesis of influenza","pathogenesis of IAV","intravascular coagulation","coagulation factors","uncontrolled coagulation system","pathogenic influenza","immune pathogenesis","IAV infection","endothelial cells","lung endothelial activation","dysfunctional coagulatory response","vascular leak","anticoagulants","platelets","protein","significant morbidity","humans","respiratory tract","fibrinolysis proteases","common complication","viral replication","underlying mechanisms","mortality","components","emerging evidence","pulmonary microembolism","year"],"language":"en"},

DISCUSSION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death. The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness. The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events. Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.

Recent studies have used intramyocardial injection in order to concentrate exosomes in the infarct. Though effective in a research setting, this method is not clinically appealing due to its invasive nature. We propose the use of a targeting peptide, cardiac homing peptide (CHP), to target intravenously-infused exosomes to the infarcted heart. Methods: Exosomes were conjugated with CHP through a DOPE-NHS linker. Ex vivo targeting was analyzed by incubating organ sections with the CHP exosomes and analyzing with fluorescence microscopy. In vitro assays were performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cells. For the animal study, we utilized an ischemia/reperfusion rat model. Animals were treated with either saline, scramble peptide exosomes, or CHP exosomes 24 h after surgery. Echocardiography was performed 4 h after surgery and 21 d after surgery. At 21 d, animals were sacrificed, and organs were collected for analysis. Results: By conjugating the exosomes with CHP, we demonstrate increased retention of the exosomes within heart sections ex vivo and in vitro with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In vitro studies showed improved viability, reduced apoptosis and increased exosome uptake when using CHP-XOs. Using an animal model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, we measured the heart function, infarct size, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis, with improved outcomes with the CHP exosomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a novel method for increasing delivery of for treatment of myocardial infarction. By targeting exosomes to the infarcted heart, there was a significant improvement in outcomes with reduced fibrosis and scar size, and increased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vandergriff, Adam; Huang, Ke; Shen, Deliang; Hu, Shiqi; Hensley, Michael Taylor; Caranasos, Thomas G.; Qian, Li; Cheng, Ke","journal":"Theranostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b2c383c48f644edcb7c4dcf40046bd58dd5e0f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5858505.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556361/; https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.20524","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHP exosomes","infused exosomes","scramble peptide exosomes","CHP-XOs","Cardiac stem cell-derived exosomes","infarcted heart","targeting peptide","surgery","heart sections ex","heart function","increased cellular proliferation","cardiac homing peptide","neonatal rat cardiomyocytes","reperfusion rat model","increased retention","cardiac regeneration","infarct size","improved outcomes","preclinical studies","angiogenesis","Recent studies","animal model of ischemia","Results","Animals","increased exosome uptake","treatment of myocardial infarction","reduced fibrosis","reduced apoptosis","scar size","improved viability","reperfusion injury","novel method","animal study","incubating organ sections","increasing delivery","significant improvement","intramyocardial injection","order","Rationale","H9C2 cells","saline","research setting","DOPE-NHS linker","assays","fluorescence microscopy","invasive nature","organs","Conclusions","Echocardiography","Methods","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Methods To determine the prevalence of EBV in the tonsils and adenoids of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals and to provide a basis for understanding the origin and biology of EBV-infected cells, the immunophenotype of all EBV-infected cells in 46 tonsils and 46 adenoids was determined by EBER in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies to T cells (CD3), B cells (CD20), and epithelial cells (cytokeratin AE1/AE3), as well as immunostaining with antibodies to EBV latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1). Results EBV was found in 43% of tonsillectomy specimens and 15% of adenoidectomy specimens. All EBV-infected cells were found to be B lymphocytes.

Risk factors for NEC include prematurity, formula feeding, and inappropriate microbial colonization of the GI tract. The pathogenesis of NEC is believed to involve weakening of the intestinal barrier by perinatal insults, translocation of luminal bacteria across the weakened barrier, an exuberant inflammatory response, and exacerbation of the barrier damage by inflammatory factors, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation-inflicted epithelial damage. Nitric oxide (NO), produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and reactive NO oxidation intermediates play a prominent role in the intestinal barrier damage by inducing enterocyte apoptosis and inhibiting the epithelial restitution processes, namely enterocyte proliferation and migration. The factors that govern iNOS upregulation in the intestine are not well understood, which hampers efforts in developing NO/iNOS-targeted therapies. Similarly, efforts to identify bacteria or bacterial colonization patterns associated with NEC have met with limited success, because the same bacterial species can be found in NEC and in non-NEC subjects. However, microbiome studies have identified the three important characteristics of early bacterial populations of the GI tract: high diversity, low complexity, and fluidity. Whether NEC is caused by specific bacteria remains a matter of debate, but data from hospital outbreaks of NEC strongly argue in favor of the infectious nature of this disease. Studies in Cronobacter muytjensii have established that the ability to induce NEC is the property of specific strains rather than the species as a whole. Progress in our understanding of the roles of bacteria in NEC will require microbiological experiments and genome-wide analysis of virulence factors.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grishin, Anatoly; Bowling, Jordan; Bell, Brandon; Wang, Jin; Ford, Henri R.","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7ca6f6e76ed923158173f68f98ef1975993cfe0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4894644.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2015.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577908/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346815006156; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022346815006156","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of NEC","hospital outbreaks of NEC","non-NEC subjects","intestinal barrier damage","specific bacteria","inflammatory factors","weakened barrier","epithelial damage","roles of bacteria","bacterial species","Risk factors","GI tract","translocation of luminal bacteria","bacterial colonization patterns","iNOS upregulation","efforts","iNOS-targeted therapies","genome-wide analysis of virulence factors","enterocyte apoptosis","enterocyte proliferation","microbiome studies","important characteristics of early bacterial populations","inappropriate microbial colonization","epithelial restitution processes","exuberant inflammatory response","property of specific strains","prominent role","formula feeding","high diversity","prematurity","microbiological experiments","perinatal insults","exacerbation","low complexity","vexing problems","oxidation intermediates","data","matter of debate","neonatal intensive care unit","vicious cycle of inflammation","ability","favor","limited success","infectious nature","fluidity","Cronobacter muytjensii","migration","synthase","understanding","Abstract Necrotizing enterocolitis","disease","Progress","intestine","Nitric oxide"],"language":"en"},

By reviewing the available histopathology of RSV bronchiolitis both in humans and relevant animal models we identify hallmark features of RSV infection of the distal airways and focus attention on the consequences of columnar cell cytopathology occurring in the bronchioles, which directly impacts the development of bronchiolar obstruction, inflammation and disease.","publish_time":"2014-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pickles, Raymond J; DeVincenzo, John","journal":"The Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03c3f8b980a0b0bc64bed96390f01c25e4a98a32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5638117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25302625/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/path.4462; https://doi.org/10.1002/path.4462","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available histopathology of RSV bronchiolitis","respiratory viruses","predominant cause of bronchiolitis","respiratory airflows","hallmark features of RSV infection","young children","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","inflammation","small bronchiolar airways","development of bronchiolar obstruction","distal airways","healthy infants","relevant animal models","acute onset of wheezing","humans","attention","major reason","consequences of columnar cell cytopathology","common eitological agents","bronchioles","subject","disease","propensity","hospital","review"],"language":"en"},

The order is unified by nidoviruses sharing intermediate (12.7kb) to very long (31.7kb) (\u002B) ssRNA genomes, each possessing a long 5\u2032-terminal gene encoding overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b reading frames that contain a diversity of functionally related enzymes and that are translated in toto using a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift mechanism, as well as by semiconserved strategies for transcribing a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that translate the viral proteins. The nidovirus that is most important to an aquaculture species is yellow head virus (YHV), which causes disease in shrimp farmed throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and is classified in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae. Fathead minnow nidovirus, genus Bafinivirus, subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, also causes disease in minnows grown for the baitfish industry in the United States. Virions similar in morphology to okaviruses and bafiniviruses have also been detected in several crab species. Of these, however, only Eriocheir sinensis ronivirus, which causes disease in the Chinese mitten crab, an important freshwater aquaculture species in China, has been shown to possess a ~22kb ssRNA genome that supports its being a nidovirus, but its taxonomic classification awaits genome sequence analysis.

Alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of HPVs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible. Novel HPV isolates have traditionally been described as \u201Ctypes\u201D. The analysis of specific HPV types is of medical importance, because HPV types typically induce type-specific lesions, i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas. Recently, it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses. Within the papillomavirus family, closely or remotely related types form species or genera. These formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses, bacteria and higher organisms, although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited. Notably, however, HPV types that are closely related (i.e. form \u201Cspecies\u201D) are associated with similar lesions. Confusion of the terms \u201Ctype\u201D and \u201Csubtype\u201D should be avoided, as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages. In contrast to many RNA viruses, HPV types evolve very slowly, and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. These divergent isolates are called \u201Cvariants\u201D. HPVs evolved together with humankind and Homo sapiens was never without HPVs, and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer. Variants of the same HPV type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bernard, Hans-Ulrich","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108213.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653204003695; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653204003695","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of specific HPV types","type-specific lesions","Novel HPV isolates","related types form species","maintenance of HPVs","taxonomy of papillomaviruses","variants","Abstract Human papillomaviruses","medical importance","medical practice","benign warts","RNA viruses","papillomavirus family","similar lesions","divergent isolates","virus family separate","circular double-stranded DNA genomes","establishment","rise","comparison","terminology","impact","higher organisms","serological diagnosis","mucosal epithelia","malignant carcinomas","nucleotide sequence","culture","isolation","genera","occurrence of genital cancers","worldwide disparities","clinical studies","Homo sapiens","rare taxonomic assemblages","Alternatives","polyomaviruses","bacteria","terms","humankind","line","contrast","different pathogenicity","formal agreements","cervical cancer","Confusion","subtype","origin of humans"],"language":"en"},

Macrolides may be beneficial in settings where children have high rates of nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage and frequent prolonged illness. The aim of our double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial was to determine if a large single dose of azithromycin (compared to placebo) reduced length of stay (LOS), duration of oxygen (O(2)) and respiratory readmissions within 6 months of children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. We also determined the effect of azithromycin on nasopharyngeal microbiology. METHODS: Children aged \u226418 months were randomised to receive a single large dose (30 mg/kg) of either azithromycin or placebo within 24 hrs of hospitalisation. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and 48hrs later. Primary endpoints (LOS, O(2)) were monitored every 12 hrs. Hospitalised respiratory readmissions 6-months post discharge was collected. RESULTS: 97 children were randomised (n = 50 azithromycin, n = 47 placebo). Median LOS was similar in both groups; azithromycin = 54 hours, placebo = 58 hours (difference between groups of 4 hours 95%CI -8, 13, p = 0.6). O(2) requirement was not significantly different between groups; Azithromycin = 35 hrs; placebo = 42 hrs (difference 7 hours, 95%CI -9, 13, p = 0.7). Number of children re-hospitalised was similar 10 per group (OR = 0.9, 95%CI 0.3, 2, p = 0.8). At least one virus was detected in 74% of children. The azithromycin group had reduced nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage (p = 0.01) but no difference in viral detection at 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Although a single dose of azithromycin reduces carriage of bacteria, it is unlikely to be beneficial in reducing LOS, duration of O(2) requirement or readmissions in children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. It remains uncertain if an earlier and/or longer duration of azithromycin improves clinical and microbiological outcomes for children.

Summary recommendations include: (1) Avoid nebulized therapies. Consider metered dose inhaler alternatives. (2) Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure. Maintain awareness of the aerosol-generating potential of all devices, including nasal cannulas, simple face masks, and venturi masks. Use non-rebreather masks when possible. Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment. (3) High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission. If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation.

Although histological examination for specific cytopathic effects forms the basis of diagnosis, the use of modern virological tests (amplification using real-time polymerase chain reaction to estimate the vial load) should replace the histological tests in the near future. HSV bronchopneumonitis is associated with the reactivation of HSV in oropharyngeal and oral-labial lesions. It seems to clearly affect patients\u2019 outcome due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, only interventional studies will be able to determine its real impact. To date, use of acyclovir in these patients remains to be assessed. Although CMV reactivation in the blood is frequent in ICU patients, CMV pneumonia is difficult to diagnose because of the cumbersomeness of the procedure (open lung biopsies).

Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies. To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474). By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections.

The results and the robustness tests confirm that ATT, SN, and PBC have a significant positive influence on SI when facing a pandemic emergency.

METHODS: The studied subjects were divided into two groups. Sixty-two post-SARS patients with osteonecrosis were one group, and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy people were as normal controlled group. Empty stomach blood samples from cubital veins were collected from both groups. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction and solid phase oligonucleotide assay. RESULTS: The blood agents of post-SARS patients changed obviously with 15.64 \u00B1 13.85 U/ml while the control group 7.96 \u00B1 4.27 U/ml; 4G/4G genotype for the PAI-1 polymorphism detected in post-SARS group was more than that of the control group, but had no statistical significance. The plasma PAI activity was related to homozygote 4G/4G genotype. This reveals that homozygote 4G/4G genotype may be a susceptible gene mark to Chinese osteonecrosis patients. CONCLUSION: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is sensitive blood symbol for screening high-risk susceptible population; 4G/4G PAI-1 genotype may be an etiological factor in osteonecrosis.","publish_time":"2013-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Wei; Li, Zirong; Shi, Zhengcai; Wang, Bailiang; Gao, Fuqiang; Yang, Yurun; Guo, Wanshou","journal":"Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bc4921a6c336a939dd0313d6dc91b992bc797a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087763.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00590-013-1223-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G PAI","G genotype","G polymorphism","post-SARS group","etiology of post-SARS osteonecrosis","blood agents of post-SARS patients","control group","Chinese osteonecrosis patients","normal controlled group","plasma PAI activity","sensitive blood symbol","high-risk population","homozygote","Plasminogen activator inhibitor","groups","post-severe acute respiratory symptom","screening high-risk susceptible population","stomach blood samples","susceptible gene mark","sensitive molecular symbols","solid phase oligonucleotide assay","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","polymerase chain reaction","correlation","early diagnosis","sex-matched healthy people","cubital veins","studied subjects","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","etiological factor","statistical significance","METHODS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The 90th passage strain (YX10p90) was selected as the live-attenuated vaccine candidate strain. YX10p90 was found to be safe in 7-day-old specific pathogen free chickens without induction of morbidity or mortality. YX10p90 provided nearly complete protection against QX-like (CH I genotype) strains and partial protection against other two major Chinese genotype strains. YX10p90 also showed no reversion to virulence after five back passages in chickens. An IBV polyvalent vaccine containing YX10p90 was developed and showed that it could provide better protection against major Chinese IBV virulent strains than commercial polyvalent vaccines. In addition, the complete genome sequence of YX10p90 was sequenced. Multiple-sequence alignments identified 38 nucleotide substitutions in the whole genome which resulted in 26 amino acid substitutions and a 110-bp deletion in the 3\u2032 untranslated region. In conclusion, the attenuated YX10p90 strain exhibited a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, and should be considered as a candidate vaccine to prevent infection of Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV.","publish_time":"2015-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Keyu; Xue, Yu; Wang, Jinglan; Chen, Weiguo; Chen, Feng; Bi, Yingzuo; Xie, Qingmei","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5085560ebe495a8198e1097d59273072f7ff9cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127481.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.01.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636916/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15000808; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15000808","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated YX10p90 strain","complete genome sequence of YX10p90","nephropathogenic IBV","IBV polyvalent vaccine","major Chinese IBV virulent strains","major Chinese genotype strains","infection of Chinese QX","live-attenuated vaccine candidate strain","complete protection","passage strain","candidate vaccine","partial protection","better protection","nucleotide substitutions","commercial polyvalent vaccines","amino acid substitutions","Multiple-sequence alignments","nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus","day-old specific pathogen free chickens","induction of morbidity","fine balance","bp deletion","attenuation","virulence","immunogenicity","passages","mortality","reversion","addition","study","conclusion","fertilized chicken eggs","untranslated region","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

For infection control purposes, the usual practice is to discard FFRs after close contact with a patient (\u201Csingle use\u201D). However, in some situations, such as during contact with tuberculosis patients, limited FFR reuse (i.e., repeated donning and doffing of the same FFR by the same person) is practiced. A related practice, extended use, involves wearing the same FFR for multiple patient encounters without doffing. Extended use and limited FFR reuse have been recommended during infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics to conserve FFR supplies. This commentary examines CDC recommendations related to FFR extended use and limited reuse and analyzes available data from the literature to provide a relative estimate of the risks of these practices compared to single use. Analysis of the available data and the use of disease transmission models indicate that decisions regarding whether FFR extended use or reuse should be recommended should continue to be pathogen- and event-specific. Factors to be included in developing the recommendations are the potential for the pathogen to spread via contact transmission, the potential that the event could result in or is currently causing a FFR shortage, the protection provided by FFR use, human factors, potential for self-inoculation, the potential for secondary exposures, and government policies and regulations. While recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for extended use and limited reuse in certain situations, some new cautions and limitations should be considered before issuing recommendations in the future. In general, extended use of FFRs is preferred over limited FFR reuse. Limited FFR reuse would allow the user a brief respite from extended wear times, but increases the risk of self-inoculation and preliminary data from one study suggest that some FFR models may begin to lose effectiveness after multiple donnings.","publish_time":"2014-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisher, Edward M.; Shaffer, Ronald E.","journal":"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4298dd5a7f7fc59b49989fff508a0361e461875.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ed1b4266877688834defa588c0705f7a32d74375.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4610368.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2014.902954; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4610368?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","FFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FFR use","FFR extended use","limited FFR reuse","extended use of FFRs","FFR models","limited reuse","FFR supplies","FFR shortage","single use","use of disease transmission models","potential","use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators","extended wear times","CDC recommendations","Disease Control","available data","previous recommendations","contact transmission","preliminary data","close contact","pathogen","related practice","doffing","risk of self-inoculation","infectious disease outbreaks","multiple patient encounters","certain situations","usual practice","human factors","multiple donnings","event-specific","infection control purposes","health care settings","Public health organizations","user","secondary exposures","decisions","brief respite","Centers","pandemics","study","protection","tuberculosis patients","government policies","new cautions","risks","literature","limitations","Prevention","practices","effectiveness","repeated donning","relative estimate","regulations","recent findings","commentary","Analysis","future","person"],"language":"en"},

The inflammatory process, cytokine storm, and lung injury that are associated with COVID-19 can put patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. It is uncertain what the total incidences of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients is currently at.

These NPAs had already been tested for 22 respiratory pathogens (18 viruses and 4 bacteria), but we found that 16 NPAs (4.9%) were PjqPCR-positive, making P. jirovecii the fourth most prevalent of the 23 microorganisms in the screen. Eleven of the 16 PjqPCR-positive patients were immunocompromised, and five had underlying pulmonary conditions. Nine NPAs were also positive for another respiratory pathogen. Six had PjqPCR-positive induced sputa less than 3 days after the NPA procedure, and five were diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia (four with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and one AIDS patient). In all six available pairs quantification of P. jirovecii DNA showed fewer copies in NPA than in induced sputum and three PjqPCR-negative NPAs corresponded to PjqPCR-positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, underscoring the fact that a negative PjqPCR screen does not exclude a diagnosis of pneumocystosis. Including P. jirovecii DNA detection to the panel of microorganisms included in screening tests used for febrile pneumonia may encourage additional investigations or support use of anti-pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients.","publish_time":"2014-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guigue, Nicolas; Alanio, Alexandre; Menotti, Jean; Castro, Nathalie De; Hamane, Samia; Peyrony, Olivier; LeGoff, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Bretagne, St\u00E9phane","journal":"Med Mycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a0d2f483947770ab7d8c21da02e258c27b34873.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107570.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/mmy/myu087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25550391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PjqPCR-negative NPAs","PjqPCR-positive patients","Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA","PjqPCR-positive induced sputa","jirovecii DNA detection","negative PjqPCR screen","consecutive NPAs","PjqPCR-positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids","immunocompromised patients","bacterial DNA","emergency cases of febrile pneumonia","adult patients","support use of anti-pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis","jirovecii mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene","induced sputum","screening tests","retrospective screening","panel of microorganisms","Detection of viral","NPA procedure","pulmonary conditions","respiratory pathogens","suspected pulmonary infections","real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction","additional investigations","influenza epidemic season","fact","fewer copies","chronic lymphoproliferative disorders","routine practice","assay","days","nasopharyngeal aspirates","available pairs quantification of","AIDS patient","viruses","diagnosis of pneumocystosis"],"language":"en"},

NSP1, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediates the degradation of cellular factors involved in both IFN induction and downstream signaling. VP3, the viral capping enzyme, utilizes a 2H-phosphodiesterase domain to prevent activation of the cellular oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. Computational, molecular, and biochemical studies have provided key insights into the structural and mechanistic basis of innate immune antagonism by NSP1 and VP3 of group A rotaviruses (RVA).

Visual capabilities are conferred by anatomical features of the eyes as well as the combination and properties of their constituent light sensitive pigments. To test whether evolutionary switches to different niches characterized by dim-light conditions coincided with molecular adaptation of the rod pigment rhodopsin, we sequenced the rhodopsin gene in twenty-two mammals including several bats and subterranean mole-rats. We compared these to thirty-seven published mammal rhodopsin sequences, from species with divergent visual ecologies, including nocturnal, diurnal and aquatic groups. All taxa possessed an intact functional rhodopsin; however, phylogenetic tree reconstruction recovered a gene tree in which rodents were not monophyletic, and also in which echolocating bats formed a monophyletic group. These conflicts with the species tree appear to stem from accelerated evolution in these groups, both of which inhabit low light environments. Selection tests confirmed divergent selection pressures in the clades of subterranean rodents and bats, as well as in marine mammals that live in turbid conditions. We also found evidence of divergent selection pressures among groups of bats with different sensory modalities based on vision and echolocation. Sliding window analyses suggest most changes occur in transmembrane domains, particularly obvious within the pinnipeds; however, we found no obvious pattern between photopic niche and predicted spectral sensitivity based on known critical amino acids. This study indicates that the independent evolution of rhodopsin vision in ecologically specialised groups of mammals has involved molecular evolution at the sequence level, though such changes might not mediate spectral sensitivity directly.","publish_time":"2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Huabin; Ru, Binghua; Teeling, Emma C.; Faulkes, Christopher G.; Zhang, Shuyi; Rossiter, Stephen J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e4a1132b0301964add6af40ca83b222d7f6d9e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2790605.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20016835/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008326","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["groups of bats","rhodopsin gene","specialised groups of mammals","independent evolution of rhodopsin vision","species tree","molecular evolution","gene tree","aquatic groups","marine mammals","intact functional rhodopsin","rod pigment rhodopsin","divergent visual ecologies","dim-light conditions","variety of light environments","low light environments","evidence of divergent selection pressures","published mammal rhodopsin sequences","Selection tests","adaptive changes","accelerated evolution","spectral sensitivity","Visual capabilities","visual systems","ecological radiation of mammals","constituent light sensitive pigments","phylogenetic tree reconstruction","clades of subterranean rodents","molecular adaptation","different niches","turbid conditions","obvious pattern","monophyletic group","different sensory modalities","subterranean mole-rats","properties","photopic niche","anatomical features","combination","transmembrane domains","sequence level","critical amino acids","evolutionary switches","eyes","echolocation","taxa","window analyses","pinnipeds","study","conflicts"],"language":"en"},

To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a longitudinal study to estimate the incidence of SARIs among children in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: During June through October 2010, we followed children aged \u003C5 years in 67 villages to identify those with cough, difficulty breathing, age-specific tachypnea and/or danger signs in the community or admitted to the local hospital. A study physician collected clinical information and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARI cases and blood for bacterial culture from those hospitalized. We tested swabs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and human parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (HPIV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We calculated virus-specific SARI incidence by dividing the number of new illnesses by the person-time each child contributed to the study. RESULTS: We followed 12,850 children for 279,029 person-weeks (pw) and identified 141 SARI cases; 76 (54%) at their homes and 65 (46%) at the hospital. RSV was associated with 7.9 SARI hospitalizations per 100,000 pw, HPIV3 2.2 hospitalizations/100,000 pw, and influenza 1.1 hospitalizations/100,000 pw. Among non-hospitalized SARI cases, RSV was associated with 10.8 illnesses/100,000 pw, HPIV3 1.8/100,000 pw, influenza 1.4/100,000 pw, and adenoviruses 0.4/100,000 pw. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses, particularly RSV, were commonly associated with SARI among children. It may be useful to explore the value of investing in prevention strategies, such as handwashing and respiratory hygiene, to reduce respiratory infections among young children in such settings.","publish_time":"2014-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nasreen, Sharifa; Luby, Stephen P.; Brooks, W.

DATA SOURCES: Published experimental studies and clinical papers that address varied aspects of ventilator-induced lung injury pathogenesis and its consequences. STUDY SELECTION: Published information relevant to the novel hypothesis of progressive lung vulnerability and to the biophysical responses of lung injury and repair. DATA EXTRACTION: None. DATA SYNTHESIS: In acute respiratory distress syndrome, the reduced size and capacity for gas exchange of the functioning \u201Cbaby lung\u201D imply loss of ventilatory capability that dwindles in proportion to severity of lung injury. Concentrating the entire ventilation workload and increasing perfusion to these already overtaxed units accentuates their potential for progressive injury. Unlike static airspace pressures, which, in theory, apply universally to aerated structures of all dimensions, the components of tidal inflation that relate to power (which include frequency and flow) progressively intensify their tissue-stressing effects on parenchyma and microvasculature as the ventilated compartment shrinks further, especially during the first phase of the evolving injury. This \u201Cventilator-induced lung injury vortex\u201D of the shrinking baby lung is opposed by reactive, adaptive, and reparative processes. In this context, relatively little attention has been paid to the evolving interactions between lung injury and response and to the timing of interventions that worsen, limit or reverse a potentially accelerating ventilator-induced lung injury process. Although universal and modifiable drivers hold the potential to progressively injure the functional lung units of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a positive feedback cycle, measures can be taken to interrupt that process and encourage growth and healing of the \u201Cbaby lung\u201D of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marini, John J.; Gattinoni, Luciano","journal":"Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c058c1cc2bd467dbf449cac2869569c7d07d444b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392018/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004416","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of lung injury","induced lung injury pathogenesis","shrinking baby lung","biophysical responses of lung injury","ventilator-induced lung injury vortex","progressive injury","evolving injury","accelerating ventilator-induced lung injury process","functional lung units of acute respiratory distress syndrome","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","novel hypothesis of progressive lung vulnerability","potential","DATA SYNTHESIS","DATA SOURCES","modifiable drivers","DATA EXTRACTION","varied aspects of ventilator","clinical papers","overtaxed units","evolving interactions","rational clinical approach","Published information relevant","reduced size","gas exchange","capacity","functioning","positive feedback cycle","experimental studies","parenchyma","perfusion","loss of ventilatory capability","proportion","power","microvasculature","dimensions","components of tidal inflation","STUDY SELECTION","favor benefit","limit","repair","healing","consequences","timing of interventions","theory","flow","tissue","structures","entire ventilation workload","effects","ventilated compartment","reparative processes","measures","growth","static airspace pressures","little attention","context","frequency","phase","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Background Rhinovirus is a recognized cause of common cold and has been shown to cause asthma exacerbations in adults and children. The burden of rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children has not been described in Spain. Objective To describe confirmed rhinovirus infections in children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection in a secondary public hospital. Patients and methods We performed a prospective descriptive study in children admitted to hospital with fever or respiratory tract infection and with a positive isolation of rhinovirus in nasopharyngeal washings between September 2004 and July 2005. Virological diagnosis was made with direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washings. The clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Results There were 76 children with rhinovirus infection, representing 25 % of admissions in 304 children with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second most frequent viral agent identified after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (29.9 % of admissions). Fifty-four children (71.1%) were under 2 years of age. The most frequent clinical diagnoses were recurrent wheezing in 60.5 %, bronchiolitis in 23.7%, pneumonia in 7.9%, and upper respiratory tract infection in 5.3 %. Fever \u003E 38 \u00B0C was present in 57.9% of the patients and radiologic infiltrate was found in 23.7%. Oxygen saturation less than 95% was found in 43.4% of the patients. Of 22 children aged more than 2 years, a diagnosis of asthmatic crisis was made in 21. Conclusions Rhinoviruses were frequently identified in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease and were the second most common viruses after RSV. In our series, it was the most frequent cause of recurrent wheezing in hospitalized children and the second most common cause in infants.","publish_time":"2006-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvo Rey, C.; Garc\u00EDa Garc\u00EDa, M.\u00AAL.; Casas Flecha, I.; S\u00E1nchez Mateos, M.

Urban GIS applications that receive data directly from citizens, or from legacy information systems, need to be able to quickly and efficiently obtain a spatial location from addresses. In this paper we understand addresses in a broader perspective, in which not only the conventional elements of postal addresses are considered, but other kinds of direct or indirect references to places, such as building names, postal codes, or telephone area codes, which are also valuable as locators to urban places. This broader view on addresses allows us to work with two perspectives. First, in the ontological definition, modeling, and implementation of an addressing database that is flexible enough to accommodate the variety of concepts and address formats used worldwide, along with direct and indirect references to places. Second, in the definition of an indicator that is able to quantify the degree of certainty that could be reached when a user-given, semi-structured address is geocoded into a spatial position, as a function of the type and completeness of the available addressing data and of the geocoding method that has been employed. This indicator, which we call Geocoding Certainty Indicator (GCI), can be used as a threshold, beyond which the geocoded event should be left out of any statistical analysis, or as a weight that allows spatial analysis methods to reduce the influence of events that have been less reliably located. In order to support geocoding activities and the determination of the GCI, we propose a conceptual schema for addressing databases. The schema is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of addressing systems, at various levels of detail, and in different countries. Our intention is to depart from the usual geocoding strategy employed in commercial GIS products, which is usually limited to the average American or British address format. The schema also extends the notion of postal address to something broader, including popular names for places, building names, reference places, and other concepts. This approach extends Simpson\u2019s and Yu\u2019s Comput. Environ. Urban Syst., 27: 283\u2013307, 2003 work on postal codes to records of any kind, including place names and loosely formatted addresses.","publish_time":"2007-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davis, Clodoveu A.; Fonseca, Frederico T.","journal":"Geoinformatica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cbe07ac1439774aaaae482b7713cc9951ca0c5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087595.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214874/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10707-006-0015-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Simpson","Yu"],"organizations":["GIS","Geocoding Certainty Indicator"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urban places","postal codes","formatted addresses","reference places","notion of postal address","conventional elements of postal addresses","Geocoding Certainty Indicator","popular names","place names","address formats","geocoding activities","geocoding method","spatial location","addressing database","usual geocoding strategy","British address format","semi-structured address","spatial analysis methods","GCI","indirect references","spatial position","broader perspective","broader view","Urban GIS applications","variety of concepts","conceptual schema","work","telephone area codes","kinds of direct","statistical analysis","ontological definition","degree of certainty","geocoded event","commercial GIS products","legacy information systems","citizens","implementation","weight","completeness","function","modeling","common georeferencing resource people","approach","Simpson\u2019s","Yu\u2019s Comput","type","influence of events","various levels","user","determination","locators","threshold","databases","order","paper","different countries","intention","city","Environ","perspectives"],"language":"en"},

However, the evidence base for HCID PPE ensembles and any associated training is lacking, with subsequent variation between healthcare providers. Aim To develop an evidence-based assessment and training tool for evaluating PPE ensembles and doffing protocols, in the assessment of patients with suspected HCIDs. Methods VIOLET (Visualising Infection with Optimised Light for Education and Training) comprises a healthcare mannequin adapted to deliver simulated bodily fluids containing UV-fluorescent tracers. On demand and remotely operated, the mannequin projectile vomits (blue), coughs (red), has diarrhoea (yellow) and is covered in sweat (orange). Wearing PPE, healthcare staff participate in an HCID risk assessment and examination of the \u2018patient\u2019, thereby becoming exposed to these bodily fluids. Contamination of PPE is visualized and body-mapped under UV light before and after removal. Observational findings and participant feedback, around its use as a training exercise, is also recorded.

TRIM8 has been demonstrated to be a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase which plays critical roles in inflammation and cancer. In this study, a TRIM8 homolog from grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcTRIM8) was cloned, and its effects on fish virus replication were investigated. The full-length EcTRIM8 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 568 amino acids with 92% identity to TRIM8 homolog from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Sequence alignment analysis indicated that EcTRIM8 contained conserved RING finger, B-box and coiled-coil domain. Expression patterns analysis showed that EcTRIM8 was predominant in kidney, gill, fin, liver, spleen and brain. After challenging with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosin-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), the EcTRIM8 transcript was significantly increased at the early stage of injection. Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed different distribution patterns of EcTRIM8 in grouper spleen (GS) cells, including punctate fluorescence evenly situated throughout the cytoplasm and bright aggregates. The ectopic expression of EcTRIM8 in vitro significantly inhibited the replication of SGIV and red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), evidenced by the obvious reduction in the severity of cytopathic effect (CPE) and the significant decrease in viral gene transcription and protein synthesis. Moreover, the transcription of the proinflammatory factors and interferon related immune factors were differently regulated by EcTRIM8 during SGIV or RGNNV infection. In addition, overexpression of EcTRIM8 significantly increased the transcription of interferon regulator factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, and enhanced IRF3 or IRF7 induced interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity. Together, our results firstly demonstrated that fish TRIM8 could exert antiviral function through the regulation of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon related transcription factors in response to fish viruses.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Youhua; Yu, Yepin; Yang, Ying; Yang, Min; Zhou, Linli; Huang, Xiaohong; Qin, Qiwei","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e56e0cbabdc46578f0d5aed2b46e68f370cd1b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27150052/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464816302893; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.04.138; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464816302893","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EcTRIM8 transcript","overexpression of EcTRIM8","ectopic expression of EcTRIM8","full-length EcTRIM8 cDNA","fish TRIM8","interferon related transcription factors","different distribution patterns of EcTRIM8","grouper spleen","TRIM8 homolog","proinflammatory factors","transcription of interferon regulator factor","replication of SGIV","Expression patterns analysis","fish virus replication","viral gene transcription","immune factors","Singapore grouper iridovirus","expression of proinflammatory cytokines","RING domain","fish viruses","IRF7 induced interferon-stimulated response element","red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus","critical roles","enhanced IRF3","RGNNV infection","punctate fluorescence","fluorescence microscopy","coil domain","important regulatory roles","conserved RING finger","Sequence alignment analysis","large yellow croaker","E3 ubiquitin ligase","significant decrease","B-box","identity","ISRE","gill","GS","polyinosin-polycytidylic acid","severity of cytopathic effect","CPE","proteins","liver","multiple biological processes","polypeptide","kidney","regulation","cells","Epinephelus coioides","Larimichthys crocea","promoter activity","protein synthesis","antiviral function","obvious reduction","cytoplasm","amino acids","inflammation","cancer","brain","effects","study","tripartite motif","early stage of injection","bright aggregates","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

Consecutive children with PPE/PE complicating community acquired pneumonia, who required diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis were included. Blood and pleural fluid samples for microbiological cultures were collected. Molecular methods were applied to identify Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses in pleural fluid. Results The study group included 64 children, median age 4 (1\u201315). Seven of 64 (10.9%) blood cultures and 11 of 64 (17.2%) pleural fluid cultures revealed bacterial growth. The most common bacteria detected was S. pneumoniae (13 blood and pleural fluid samples from 11/64 (17.2%) children). DNA sequences of typical bacteria were found in 29/64 (45.3%) pleural fluid samples. S. pneumoniae was identified in 90% of these samples. The most common serotypes were: serotype 6B in 9/26 (36.6%), 19A in 6/26 (23%), serotype 3 in 3/26 (11.5%), 6A and 23F (both in 2/26 i.e. 7.7%) patients. Molecular methods identified atypical bacteria in 8/58 (13.8%) and respiratory viruses in 12/58 (20.7%) pleural fluid samples. Conclusions S. pneumoniae, in particular serotype 6B and 19A, is the most common etiologic agent of PPE/PE in Polish children. The use of PCR significantly improves pathogen identification in pleural fluid.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krenke, Katarzyna; Sadowy, Ewa; Podsiad\u0142y, Edyta; Hryniewicz, Waleria; Demkow, Urszula; Kulus, Marek","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43efb81147c4afdf801770a34859b07423f3a446.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126629.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2016.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27296817/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611116300853; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611116300853","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["PPE/PE","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pleural fluid samples","pleural fluid cultures","pleural empyema","etiology of PPE","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","Polish children","Consecutive children","blood cultures","common bacteria","Molecular methods","common etiologic agent of PPE","PE complicating community","Streptococcus pneumonia","microbiological cultures","respiratory viruses","common serotypes","molecular techniques","particular serotype","study group","atypical bacteria","prospective study","Streptococcus pyogenes","DNA sequences of typical bacteria","Staphylococcus aureus","increasing incidence of parapneumonic effusion","Haemophilus influenzae","pathogen identification","Abstract Background","standard culture","diagnostic","bacterial growth","use of PCR","median age","Central Europe","Conclusions","data","therapeutic thoracentesis","recent studies","patients"],"language":"en"},

The need for antimicrobial mass medications is based on beliefs that group/s of animals will contract a bacterial disease (i.e. morbidity) and/or die (i.e. mortality). Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) represents the major indication for cattle antimicrobials worldwide. The objectives were to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) for naturally occurring BRD investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis/metaphylaxis to prevent morbidity/mortality. In total, 58 publications met the inclusion criteria summarizing 169 individual RCTs, spanning 50 years (1966\u20132016). Antimicrobial prophylaxis and metaphylaxis demonstrated moderate, yet highly variable relative risk reductions in BRD morbidity. These were dependent on the antimicrobial classes used, dependent on metaphylaxis definition, BRD attack rates and duration of the RCTs. Best relative risk reductions were from broad-spectrum critically important antimicrobials, or combinations. BRD prophylaxis/metaphylaxis represents major antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in absolute risk reduction of morbidity/mortality. Despite widespread use of prevention products, the need for antimicrobial mass medications should be re-evaluated since the underlying problem is more likely the segmented infrastructure of the feedlot and veal calf industries compared to the disease itself.","publish_time":"2017-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baptiste, Keith Edward; Kyvsgaard, Niels Christian","journal":"Pathog Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68671219e4453cae8ff7209fb84db97c1b12bf13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108556.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830074/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femspd/ftx083","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial prophylaxis","BRD prophylaxis","BRD morbidity","antimicrobial classes","major antimicrobial consumption","routine use of antimicrobial mass medications","metaphylaxis definition","mortality","BRD attack rates","variable relative risk reductions","absolute risk reduction of morbidity","Best relative risk reductions","need","individual RCTs","bacterial disease","Bovine respiratory disease","major indication","important antimicrobials","cattle antimicrobials","variable short-term gains","widespread use of prevention products","meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials","human medicine","segmented infrastructure","feedlot","beliefs","systematic review","veal calf industries","duration","s of animals","inclusion criteria","distinct difference","underlying problem","group","publications","combinations","healthy individuals","total","objectives","years"],"language":"en"},

Since its emergence, MERS-CoV continues to spread to countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula and gives rise to sporadic human infections following the entry of infected individuals to other countries, which can precipitate outbreaks similar to the one that occurred in South Korea in 2015. Current therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection have primarily been adapted from previous drugs used for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In search of new potential drug candidates, we screened a library composed of 2334 clinically approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds. The drug saracatinib, a potent inhibitor of Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFK), was identified as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in vitro. Our results suggest that saracatinib potently inhibits MERS-CoV at the early stages of the viral life cycle in Huh-7 cells, possibly through the suppression of SFK signaling pathways. Furthermore, saracatinib exhibited a synergistic effect with gemcitabine, an anticancer drug with antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. These data indicate that saracatinib alone or in combination with gemcitabine can provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Jin Soo; Jung, Eunhye; Kim, Meehyein; Baric, Ralph S.; Go, Yun Young","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcc20c80be8954f1682993217bbd2a78659a16f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6024778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29795047/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10060283","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Arabian Peninsula","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","treatment of MERS","inhibitor of MERS","drug saracatinib","CoV replication","treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory illness","gemcitabine","anticancer drug","countries","Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","search of new potential drug candidates","approved drugs","previous drugs","suppression of SFK","potent inhibitor of Src","new therapeutic option","humans","emerging zoonotic pathogen","sporadic human infections","early stages","antiviral activity","rise","entry of infected individuals","family of tyrosine kinases","viral life cycle","Arabian Peninsula","synergistic effect","high fatality rate","Saudi Arabia","library","Current therapeutics","RNA viruses","cells","active compounds","combination","pathways","outbreaks similar","results","emergence","South Korea","data"],"language":"en"},

The first is primer-dependent and associated with the 106-kDa non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), whereas the second is catalysed by the 22-kDa nsp8. This latter enzyme is capable of de novo initiation and has been proposed to operate as a primase. Interestingly, this protein has only been crystallized together with the 10-kDa nsp7, forming a hexadecameric, dsRNA-encircling ring structure [i.e. nsp(7\u002B8), consisting of 8 copies of both nsps]. To better understand the implications of these structural characteristics for nsp8-driven RNA synthesis, we studied the prerequisites for the formation of the nsp(7\u002B8) complex and its polymerase activity. We found that in particular the exposure of nsp8\u0027s natural N-terminal residue was paramount for both the protein\u0027s ability to associate with nsp7 and for boosting its RdRp activity. Moreover, this \u2018improved\u2019 recombinant nsp8 was capable of extending primed RNA templates, a property that had gone unnoticed thus far. The latter activity is, however, \u223C20-fold weaker than that of the primer-dependent nsp12-RdRp at equal monomer concentrations.

Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. RESULTS: Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p\u003C0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (\u003E0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (\u003E10 x 10(9)/L, p\u003C0.001) and neutrophilia (\u003E75 x 10(9)/L, p\u003C0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (p\u003C0.001), which was confirmed by survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.

Accurate country level surveillance is critical to ending the pandemic. Effective routine reporting systems which track the course of the epidemic are vital in addressing TB. China, which has the third largest TB epidemic in the world and has developed a reporting system to help with the control and prevention of TB, this study examined its effectiveness in Eastern China. METHODS: The number of TB cases reported internally in two hospitals in Eastern China were compared to the number TB cases reported by these same hospitals in the national reporting systems in order to assess the accuracy of reporting. Qualitative data from interviews with key health officials and researcher experience using the TB reporting systems were used to identify factors affecting the accuracy of TB cases being reported in the national systems. RESULTS: This study found that over a quarter of TB cases recorded in the internal hospital records were not entered into the national TB reporting systems, leading to an under representation of national TB cases. Factors associated with underreporting included unqualified and overworked health personnel, poor supervision and accountability at local and national levels, and a complicated incohesive health information management system. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TB in Eastern China is being underreported. Given that Eastern China is a developed province, one could assume similar problems may be found in other parts of China with fewer resources as well as many low- and middle-income countries. Having an accurate account of the number of national TB cases is essential to understanding the national and global burden of the disease and in managing TB prevention and control efforts. As such, factors associated with underreporting need to be addressed in order to reduce underreporting.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Danju; Pender, Michelle; Jiang, Weixi; Mao, Wenhui; Tang, Shenglan","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cd9b37d110968368ce6f837e002788ac6158af8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6907198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829147/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-8009-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern China","China"],"keyphrases":["national TB reporting systems","prevention of TB","TB prevention","number of TB cases","number TB cases","number of national TB cases","accuracy of TB cases","representation of national TB cases","quarter of TB cases","national systems","national reporting systems","largest TB epidemic","Eastern China","national levels","accuracy of reporting","parts of China","Effective routine reporting systems","study","factors","key health officials","overworked health personnel","high global health priority","hospitals","order","underreporting need","complicated incohesive health information management system","accurate account","global burden","control efforts","developed province","leading cause of death","Accurate country level surveillance","researcher experience","poor supervision","accountability","interviews","course","world","disease","Qualitative data","Tuberculosis","fewer resources","internal hospital records","effectiveness","similar problems","BACKGROUND","METHODS","middle-income countries","pandemic","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we examined whether the regulation of viral poly(A) tail length is cell-type independent and whether it is a common feature of coronaviruses to assess the significance of the regulation. By ligating head-to-tail viral RNA positive strands and sequencing, we found that (1) the regulation pattern of coronaviral poly(A) tail length in BCoV-infected hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells was similar to that in BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells and (2) the poly(A) tail length of wild-type avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) virulent strain IBV-TW1, which is in the genus gammacoronaviruses, varied throughout infection in primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells and in the tracheas of 1-day-old chicks. Interestingly, the poly(A) tail length variation was similarly found in the avirulent IBV strain H120 in CEK cells, although the overall poly(A) tail length was shorter for this virus. The results suggest that the regulation of coronaviral poly(A) tail length during infection may be a common feature among coronaviruses and can occur in a noncancerous cell line (BHK-21 cells), primary cell culture (CEK cells), and living system (chickens), further reinforcing the biological significance of this regulation during coronavirus infection.

Soon after its emergence, CPV-2 underwent genetic evolution giving rise consecutively to two antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b that replaced progressively the original type. In 2000, a new antigenic variant, CPV-2c, was detected in Italy and rapidly spread to several countries. In comparison to the original type CPV-2, the antigenic variants display increased pathogenicity in dogs and extended host range, being able to infect and cause disease in cats. Epidemiological survey indicate that the newest type CPV-2c is becoming prevalent in different geographic regions and is often associated to severe disease in adult dogs and also in dogs that have completed the vaccination protocols. However, the primary cause of failure of CPV vaccination is interference by maternally derived immunity. Diagnosis of CPV infection by traditional methods has been shown to be poorly sensitive, especially in the late stages of infections. New diagnostic approaches based on molecular methods have been developed for sensitive detection of CPV in clinical samples and rapid characterisation of the viral type.

This prospective study analyzed the factors influencing treatment outcome in patients with TB treated with and without a hospital-based case management (HBCM) approach in a referral center in Taipei. Methods A register-based cohort study design was used to enroll all new cases of pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB from February 2003 to January 2004. The case manager served as the coordinator among patients, physicians and public health nurses, to facilitate compliance with anti-TB treatment. Treatment outcomes were assessed according to the consensus recommendations of the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. Results Suspected or confirmed pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB was diagnosed in 524 patients in our hospital from February 2003 to January 2004. Fifty-two of these patients were excluded due to duplicate reporting, previous treatment or death before enrollment. Out of 472 patients enrolled, 103 whose original diagnosis was revised were further excluded, leaving 369 cases eligible for analysis. Patients with case management had a significantly higher rate of successful treatment (cured plus completed treatment) compared to patients without case management, (240/277, 86.6% vs. 67/92, 72.8%; p = 0.002). The overall successful treatment rate including both case and non-case management was 83.2% (307/369), which was higher than the nationwide surveillance data of 78.3% in 2002 and 69.4% in 2003. Conclusion Treatment of TB patients by a HBCM approach provides improved treatment outcomes compared to those without case management.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Rong-Luh; Lin, Fung-J; Wu, Chien-Liang; Peng, Ming-Jen; Chen, Pei-Jan; Kuo, Hsu-Tah","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f62fc16d544b5af3645be94467aa2fffcab06f0f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664609601625; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664609601625","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease","HBCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusion Treatment of TB patients","anti-TB treatment","previous treatment","completed treatment","non-case management","improved treatment outcomes","case manager","hospital-based case management","higher rate of successful treatment","overall successful treatment rate","extrapulmonary TB","extra-pulmonary TB","HBCM approach","public health nurses","new cases of pulmonary","heavy public health burden","World Health Organization","prospective study","Purpose Tuberculosis","cases eligible","register-based cohort study design","International Union","compliance","death","physicians","duplicate reporting","coordinator","factors","consensus recommendations","Lung Disease","Methods","referral center","Taiwan","nationwide surveillance data","Taipei","enrollment","Background","analysis","Results","original diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

This modification generates an N-terminal threonine nucleophile that is used to hydrolyze the pantetheinyl moiety of its natural substrate. We determined the crystal structure of autoactivated ThnT to 1.8 \u00C5 through X-ray crystallography. Comparison to a mutationally inactivated precursor structure revealed several large conformational rearrangements near the active site. To probe the relevance of these transitions, we designed a pantetheine-like chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inactivator and co-crystallized it with ThnT. Although this class of inhibitor has been in use for several decades, the mode of inactivation had not been determined for an enzyme that uses an N-terminal nucleophile. The co-crystal structure revealed the CMK bound to the N-terminal nucleophile of ThnT through an ether linkage and analysis suggests inactivation through a direct displacement mechanism. More importantly, this inactivated complex shows three regions of ThnT that are critical to the formation of the substrate binding pocket undergo rearrangement upon autoproteolysis. Comparison of ThnT with other autoproteolytic enzymes of disparate evolutionary lineage revealed a high degree similarity within the pro-enzyme active site, reflecting shared chemical constraints. However, after autoproteolysis many enzymes, like ThnT, are observed to rearrange to accommodate their specific substrate. We propose this is a general phenomenon, whereby autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry may possess similar structural features that dissipate upon rearrangement into a mature state.","publish_time":"2012-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buller, Andrew R; Labonte, Jason W; Freeman, Michael F; Wright, Nathan T; Schildbach, Joel F; Townsend, Craig A","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19068110bc24a50616d4dba2a9202fd14cad9c4d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ddf6615410dab0c126f592701793e25fc3f58b50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3428426.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3428426?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283612004858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22706025/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283612004858; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.06.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Comparison of ThnT","function of ThnT","regions of ThnT","N-terminal nucleophile of ThnT","crystal structure of autoactivated ThnT","N-terminal threonine nucleophile","co-crystal structure","pro-enzyme active site","CMK","cis-Autoproteolysis","natural substrate","specific substrate","mutationally inactivated precursor structure","substrate binding pocket","shared chemistry","inactivated complex","mode of inactivation","shared chemical constraints","post-translational modification necessary","autoproteolytic enzymes of disparate evolutionary lineage","high degree similarity","large conformational rearrangements","analysis","autoprocessing systems","similar structural features","ether linkage","inactivator","chloromethyl ketone","use","pantetheine","biosynthesis","\u03B2-lactam antibiotic thienamycin","direct displacement mechanism","general phenomenon","X-ray crystallography","decades","pantetheinyl moiety","transitions","class of inhibitor","mature state","relevance"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, 31 pig farms with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea were investigated in Catalonia (NE Spain) from February 2017 until June 2018.

In 19 of the studied farms additional fecal samples from apparently healthy pen-mates were collected and tested for the same panel of infectious agents. Samples were bacteriologically cultured and tested by PCR for E. coli virulence factors genes, C. perfringens types A and C toxins (Cp\u03B1, Cp\u03B2, Cp\u03B22) and C. difficile toxins (TcdA, TcdB). Moreover, Rotavirus A (RVA), Rotavirus B (RVB), Rotavirus C (RVC), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were also determined by RT-qPCR. More than one pathogen could be detected in all of the outbreaks. Nevertheless, RVA was the only agent that could be statistically correlated with the outcome of diarrhea. For the other viruses and bacteria analyzed significant differences between the diseased pigs and the controls were not found. In spite of this, the individual analysis of each of the studied farms indicated that other agents such as RVB, RVC, toxigenic C. difficile or pathogenic E. coli could play a relevant role in the outbreak of diarrhea.

Recent studies are beginning to redefine these signs of viral infection in terms of specific effects of viruses on cellular processes. In this chapter, these concepts have been illustrated by describing the replication sites produced by many different viruses. In many cases, the cellular rearrangements caused during virus infection lead to the construction of sophisticated platforms in the cell that concentrate replicase proteins, virus genomes, and host proteins required for replication, and thereby increase the efficiency of replication. Interestingly, these same structures, called virus factories, virus inclusions, or virosomes, can recruit host components that are associated with cellular defences against infection and cell stress. It is possible that cellular defence pathways can be subverted by viruses to generate sites of replication. The recruitment of cellular membranes and cytoskeleton to generate virus replication sites can also benefit viruses in other ways. Disruption of cellular membranes can, for example, slow the transport of immunomodulatory proteins to the surface of infected cells and protect against innate and acquired immune responses, and rearrangements to cytoskeleton can facilitate virus release.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Netherton, Christopher; Moffat, Katy; Brooks, Elizabeth; Wileman, Thomas","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b3c5b40c4719c8b4b06b914396650af877d83f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112299.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352707700040; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352707700040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication sites","Abstract Virus replication","virus factories","virus genomes","virus inclusions","virus release","sites of replication","virus infection lead","hallmark of virus infection","cellular rearrangements","cellular defences","cellular processes","efficiency of replication","host proteins","recruitment of cellular membranes","Disruption of cellular membranes","cellular defence pathways","different viruses","cytoskeleton","cell stress","signs of viral infection","replicase proteins","host components","extensive rearrangement of host cell cytoskeletal","terms of specific effects of viruses","transport of immunomodulatory proteins","membrane compartments","construction of sophisticated platforms","virosomes","tissue culture","surface of infected cells","immune responses","example","cytopathic effect","years","structures","cases","Recent studies","chapter","concepts"],"language":"en"},

Potentially, the targeting of host proteins and pathways essential for the detrimental effects of pathogens offers an approach that may discover broad-spectrum anti-pathogen countermeasures and circumvent the effects of pathogen mutations leading to resistance. Here we report implementation of a strategy for discovering broad-spectrum host-oriented therapies against multiple pathogenic agents by multiplex screening of drugs for protection against the detrimental effects of multiple pathogens, identification of host cell pathways inhibited by the drug, and screening for effects of the agent on other pathogens exploiting the same pathway. We show that a clinically used antimalarial drug, Amodiaquine, discovered by this strategy, protects host cells against infection by multiple toxins and viruses by inhibiting host cathepsin B. Our results reveal the practicality of discovering broadly acting anti-pathogen countermeasures that target host proteins exploited by pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zilbermintz, Leeor; Leonardi, William; Jeong, Sun-Young; Sjodt, Megan; McComb, Ryan; Ho, Chi-Lee C.; Retterer, Cary; Gharaibeh, Dima; Zamani, Rouzbeh; Soloveva, Veronica; Bavari, Sina; Levitin, Anastasia; West, Joel; Bradley, Kenneth A.; Clubb, Robert T.; Cohen, Stanley N.; Gupta, Vivek; Martchenko, Mikhail","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a89b93e5c8c6fb1352d9881f6ca6b592ef4af30.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0d354b208fdfa2806bf33fd03e940e057b339de5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4550849.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26310922/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep13476","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cathepsin","host cells","detrimental effects of pathogens","detrimental effects of multiple pathogens","targeting of host proteins","effects of pathogen mutations","broad-spectrum host-oriented therapies","identification of host cell pathways","broad-spectrum anti-pathogen countermeasures","multiple toxins","resistance","antimicrobial countermeasures","strategy","multiple pathogenic agents","pathways essential","antimalarial drug","multiplex screening of drugs","infection","protection","effective treatment of infectious diseases","approach","viruses","threat","practicality","Amodiaquine","results","implementation"],"language":"en"},

Its usefulness in people with acute asthma is unknown. Our aim was to assess the ability of the CCQ to detect viral infection and to monitor recovery during a viral induced asthma exacerbation and confirmed by virological testing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied subjects (\u22657 yrs) admitted to hospital with acute asthma and diagnosed as positive (n = 63), or negative to viral infection (n = 27) according to molecular and virological testing from respiratory samples. CCQ, asthma history and asthma control questionnaires were completed and repeated 4\u20136 weeks later. Sensitivity, specificity, and response to change of the CCQ were assessed by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis and effect size calculation respectively. The CCQ did not discriminate between viral and non-viral infection for subjects with asthma (sensitivity = 76.2%; specificity = 29.6%). ROC analysis could not differentiate between positive or negative virus in subjects with asthma. The CCQ had a large response to change following recovery (effect size = 1.01). 39% of subjects recovering from viral exacerbation remained positive to virological testing at follow-up despite improvement in clinical symptoms. The CCQ reflected clinical improvement in these subjects, thus providing additional information to complement virological testing. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The CCQ is a useful instrument for monitoring response to viral infection in people with asthma. Reliable differentiation between viral and non-viral asthma exacerbations was not achieved with the CCQ and requires specific virological testing. When combined with virological testing, the CCQ should be a useful outcome measure for evaluating therapies in viral-induced asthma.","publish_time":"2008-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Powell, Heather; Smart, Joanne; Wood, Lisa G.; Grissell, Terry; Shafren, Darren R.; Hensley, Michael J.; Gibson, Peter G.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab54f13666ed771c15684d73ff6bcc7c92b8ae05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2266793.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18350141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCQ","viral-induced asthma","viral exacerbation","viral induced asthma exacerbation","non-viral asthma exacerbations","non-viral infection","acute asthma","asthma history","subjects","specific virological testing","asthma control questionnaires","monitoring response","ROC analysis","large response","people","clinical improvement","Sensitivity","specificity","effect size calculation","following recovery","useful instrument","negative virus","clinical symptoms","useful outcome measure","therapies","receiver operator curve","Reliable differentiation","common cold questionnaire","respiratory samples","additional information","BACKGROUND","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","yrs","SIGNIFICANCE","hospital","usefulness","ability","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","aim","weeks"],"language":"en"},

In the past six decades, rabies has emerged three times in Guangxi, and the province has reported the largest number of rabies cases in China. The domestic dog is the principal vector for rabies, and 95% of human cases are associated with transmission from dogs. RESULTS: To understand the genetic relationship between street rabies virus (RABV) from Guangxi, genetic diversity analysis was performed using RABV isolates collected between 1999 and 2012. The N gene of 42 RABV isolates, and the P and M genes, as well as fragments of the 3\u2032 terminus (L(1\u2013680)) and the polymerase activity module of the L gene (L(pam)) of 36 RABV isolates were sequenced. In addition, whole genome sequencing was performed for 5 RABV isolates. There was evidence of topological discrepancy in the phylogenetic trees based on different genes of the RABV isolates. Amino acid variation of the deduced N protein exhibited different patterns to those obtained from the P and M proteins reported here, and the previously reported G protein (Tang H. et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 8(10): e3114, 2014), and L(1\u2013680) and L(pam). These RABV isolates were divided into three main branches against fixed strains. CONCLUSION: RABV is prevalent in Guangxi province and strains collected over the last two decades belong mainly to three groups (I, II, III). These RABV isolates reveal genetic diversity. Individual RABV genes from Guangxi exhibit different evolutionary characteristics. The results will have benefits for continuing comprehensive rabies surveillance, prevention and control in China.

International preparedness to manage imported cases Ebola virus infection was inadequate, highlighted by cases of nosocomial transmission. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a re-emerging tick-borne VHF centred in the Eurasian region, affecting a large geographical area and with human-to-human transmission reported, especially in the healthcare setting. Objectives To systematically review the characteristics of travel associated Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. Methods A systematic review of travel-associated cases of CCHF was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement protocol. PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index (SCI) and ProMED databases were searched for reports published between January 1960 and January 2016. Three independent reviewers selected and reviewed studies and extracted data. Results 21 cases of travel associated CCHF were identified, of which 12 died (3 outcome unknown) and 4 secondary (nosocomial) infections were reported. Risk occupations or activities for CCHF infection were reported in 8/12 cases when data were available. Travel from Asia to Asia occurred in 9 cases, Africa to Africa occurred in 5 cases, Africa to Europe in 3 cases, Asia to Europe in 2 cases and Europe to Europe in 2 cases. Conclusion CCHF related to travel is rare, is generally associated with at risk activities/occupation and is frequently fatal. Key to early diagnosis and prevention of nosocomial transmission is an understanding of CCHF risk factors and the geographical distribution of CCHF. International travel to CCHF endemic areas is increasing and clinicians and laboratory personnel managing returning travellers should maintain a high index of suspicion.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leblebicioglu, Hakan; Ozaras, Resat; Fletcher, Tom E.; Beeching, Nick J.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56af6839af89ea1177803ccc92a08a950d0aef08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110636.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893916000326; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893916000326; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2016.03.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26970396/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCHF"],"locations":["Asia","Africa","Europe"],"keyphrases":["cases of travel","associated cases of CCHF","risk of travel","cases of nosocomial transmission","CCHF infection","Conclusion CCHF","International travel","characteristics of travel","Europe","geographical distribution of CCHF","systematic review of travel","understanding of CCHF risk factors","CCHF endemic areas","imported cases Ebola virus infection","risk activities","Africa","Risk occupations","Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever","human transmission","viral haemorrhagic fever","prevention of nosocomial transmission","Systematic Reviews","International preparedness","recent Ebola epidemic","Science Citation Index","large geographical area","re-emerging tick-borne VHF","high index of suspicion","Meta-Analyses","clinicians","returning travellers","PRISMA","Eurasian region","public awareness","Preferred Reporting Items","SCOPUS","early diagnosis","laboratory personnel","ProMED databases","statement protocol","reviewed studies","PubMed","Summary Background","independent reviewers","Key","Methods","Results","outcome unknown","reports","infections","healthcare setting","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Among them, accessory protein 3b (also known as ORF4) was lately identified as one of the viral interferon antagonist. Recently our lab uncovered a new role for 3b in upregulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity and its downstream genes. Thus, we believe that 3b might play an important role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis and therefore is of considerable interest. The current study aims at identifying novel host cellular interactors of the 3b protein. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation techniques, we have identified a host transcription factor RUNX1b (Runt related transcription factor, isoform b) as a novel interacting partner for SARS-CoV 3b protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitaion (ChIP) and reporter gene assays in 3b expressing jurkat cells showed recruitment of 3b on the RUNX1 binding element that led to an increase in RUNX1b transactivation potential on the IL2 promoter. Kinase assay and pharmacological inhibitor treatment implied that 3b also affect RUNX1b transcriptional activity by regulating its ERK dependent phosphorylation levels. Additionally, mRNA levels of MIP-1\u03B1, a RUNX1b target gene upregulated in SARS-CoV infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells, were found to be elevated in 3b expressing U937 monocyte cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results unveil a novel interaction of SARS-CoV 3b with the host factor, RUNX1b, and speculate its physiological relevance in upregulating cytokines and chemokine levels in state of SARS virus infection.","publish_time":"2012-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Varshney, Bhavna; Agnihotram, Sudhakar; Tan, Yee-Joo; Baric, Ralph; Lal, Sunil K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a5c7512b0e842a7b5f1d1511d0f035a0dbc3c25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3257236.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22253733/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029542","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["b protein","isoform b","SARS-CoV pathogenesis","SARS coronavirus","novel interaction of SARS","host transcription factor RUNX1b","host factor","RUNX1b transcriptional activity","SARS-CoV infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells","RUNX1b target gene","state of SARS virus infection","RUNX1b transactivation potential","chemokine levels","novel host cellular interactors","jurkat cells","U937 monocyte cells","Runt related transcription factor","novel interacting partner","mRNA levels of MIP","ERK dependent phosphorylation levels","important role","new role","current study","reporter gene assays","unique group specific accessory proteins","causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","genome","upregulating cytokines","unknown functions","physiological relevance","hybrid","ChIP","increase","pharmacological inhibitor treatment","results","upregulation of AP","recruitment","Kinase assay","co-immunoprecipitation techniques","yeast","IL2 promoter","RUNX1 binding element","Chromatin immunoprecipitaion","BACKGROUND","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","SIGNIFICANCE","downstream genes","viral interferon antagonist","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","lab","ORF4"],"language":"en"},

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure are the main features of COVID-19 infection, two recent studies demonstrate that kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common, and that kidney involvement is associated with high risk of in-hospital death. Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. We hypothesize that low sodium status makes renal involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys. We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections, and that low sodium intake be corrected early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Post, Adrian; Dullaart, Robin P.F.; Bakker, Stephan J.L.","journal":"Virus research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c41474b22e86f728dab7e88ddbe1750f93018b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220305724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445872/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220305724?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low sodium intake","kidney involvement","high dietary sodium intake results","kidney impairment","course of COVID","low sodium status","kidney disease","kidney tissue","hospitalized COVID","severe COVID","common dietary recommendations","patients","main features of COVID","ACE2 expression","high risk","renal involvement","upregulation of membrane bound ACE2","recent studies","acute respiratory failure","hypertension","diffuse alveolar damage","potential conflict","diabetes","infections","rats","human pathogenic coronaviruses","SARS-CoV","epithelial cells","hospital death","enzyme","receptor","kidneys","tissues","angiotensin"],"language":"en"},

In spite of large scale morbidity, and long lasting polyarthralgia, no licensed vaccine or antivirals are available for the clinical management of CHIKV infection. In this study, a novel RNA interference based strategy has been adopted for effective inhibition of CHIKV. Four artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) were designed to target different regions of CHIKV genome. These amiRNAs significantly inhibited CHIKV replication in Vero cells at both RNA and protein levels as assessed by qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence techniques. Further inhibition of the infectious CHIKV up to 99.8% was demonstrated by plaque reduction assay. Concatemerization of amiRNA resulted in higher inhibition of CHIKV than individual amiRNAs. In addition, we studied the effect of combination of RNAi based therapy with other classical antivirals like chloroquine, ribavirin and mycophenolic acid, that helped in understanding the rational selection of RNAi based combination therapy. These findings provide a promising avenue for the development of novel amiRNA or combination based therapeutics against emerging CHIKV.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saha, Amrita; Bhagyawant, Sameer S.; Parida, Manmohan; Dash, Paban Kumar","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d7c5b0b32c168047cf4ca3463656f62eff5009b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27565991/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.08.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216301528; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216301528","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging CHIKV","infectious CHIKV","higher inhibition of CHIKV","effective inhibition of CHIKV","inhibited CHIKV replication","clinical management of CHIKV infection","different regions of CHIKV genome","combination therapy","effect of combination","individual amiRNAs","development of novel amiRNA","novel RNA interference","classical antivirals","Concatemerization of amiRNA","rational selection of RNAi","Vero cells","lasting polyarthralgia","chloroquine","ribavirin","protein levels","licensed vaccine","strategy","therapeutics","promising avenue","spite of large scale morbidity","parts","qRT-PCR","mycophenolic acid","significant arboviral threats","study","Abstract Chikungunya virus","immunofluorescence techniques","plaque reduction assay","world","findings","artificial microRNAs","addition"],"language":"en"},

These compounds have relevant pharmacological activities, such as: cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines (especially leukemia), parasites (Plasmodium, Leshmania, and Trypanosoma), retroviruses (e.g., HIV), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chemoinformatic and toxicoinformatic tools were used here to perform a computational analysis of 70 coumarins and 70 xanthones isolated from this genus in order to explore their potential as new drugs. Most coumarins from this genus possess similar patterns of druglikeness with differences in its physicochemical properties. Xanthones, on the other hand, show quite similar physicochemical properties and druglikeness. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of these compounds (57 coumarins and 59 xanthones) are in compliance with Lipinski\u00B4s Rule of Five. Remarkably, two xanthones (2-hydroxyxanthone and caledonixanthone-B) have leadlikeness potential that accordingly with chemoinformatic analysis may target MAO A and B, respectively, and therefore may exhibit antidepressant potential. These compounds also target tyrosine-phosphorilation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) which is over-expressed in a variety of hematological and brain cancers, therefore they could act as anticancer compounds. Several toxicological predictions were also depicted. Coumarins could be an irritant and may affect the reproductive system, while xanthones may have mutagenic results. To our knowledge, this is the first chemoinformatic report on the main active compounds of this genus and its potential for drug development.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez-Verjan, J.

We have used this device to characterize enterovirus inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action. In contrast to population methods, single-cell analysis reveals that each class of inhibitor interferes with the viral infection cycle in a manner that can be distinguished by principal component analysis.

ABSTRACT The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is characterized in its more severe form, by an acute respiratory failure which can worsen to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and get complicated with thrombotic events and heart dysfunction. Therefore, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is common. Ultrasound, which has become an everyday tool in the ICU, can be very useful during COVID-19 pandemic, since it provides the clinician with information which can be interpreted and integrated within a global assessment during the physical examination. A description of some of the potential applications of ultrasound is depicted in this document, in order to supply the physicians taking care of these patients with a adapted guide to the intensive care setting. Some of its applications since ICU admission include verification of the correct position of the endotracheal tube, contribution to safe cannulation of lines, and identification of complications and thrombotic events. Furthermore, pleural and lung ultrasound can be an alternative diagnostic test to assess the degree of involvement of the lung parenchyma by means of the evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns, identification of pleural effusions and barotrauma. Echocardiography provides information of heart involvement, detects cor pulmonale and shock states.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guti\u00E9rrez, Virginia Fraile; Mar\u00EDa Ayuela Azc\u00E1rate, Jos\u00E9; Torres, David P\u00E9rez; Zapata, Llu\u00EDs; Yakushev, Andrey Luis Rodr\u00EDguez; Calvo, Ana Ochagav\u00EDa","journal":"Med Intensiva","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/874b73ba78d1d83773cf28abac4ab91f5a0dcf9f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medin.2020.04.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210569120301558?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210569120301558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UCI","Intensive Care Unit","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ingreso en","derrame pleural y","pandemia COVID","lung ultrasound","convertida en una herramienta","uso habitual en","cl\u00EDnico puede ser interpretada e integrada en","que motiva","ya que","cor pulmonale y estados","ICU admission","se caracteriza por producir en","e identificar complicaciones y fen\u00F3menos tromb\u00F3ticos","potential applications of ultrasound","puede ser muy \u00FAtil durante","insuficiencia respiratoria que puede evolucionar hacia neumon\u00EDa y s\u00EDndrome","ecograf\u00EDa pleuropulmonar puede ser una alternativa diagn\u00F3stica v\u00E1lida que permite evaluar","informaci\u00F3n obtenida por","infecci\u00F3n por SARS-CoV","identification of pleural effusions","Intensive Care Unit","intensive care setting","information of heart involvement","thrombotic events","barotrauma","presentar complicaciones como fen\u00F3menos tromb\u00F3ticos y disfunci\u00F3n cardiaca","evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns","proporcionar una gu\u00EDa","UCI incluyen confirmar","valoraci\u00F3n global durante","sus aplicaciones desde","acute respiratory failure","afectaci\u00F3n card\u00EDaca","afectaci\u00F3n pulmonar","identification of complications","paciente cr\u00EDtico","degree of involvement","acute respiratory distress syndrome","global assessment","heart dysfunction","lung parenchyma","shock states","clinical picture of SARS","ecocardiograf\u00EDa proporciona informaci\u00F3n acerca","los m\u00E9dicos responsables adaptado","SDRA","distr\u00E9s respiratorio agudo","grado","formas graves","identificaci\u00F3n","v\u00EDas","cuadro","tubo endotraqueal","correcta posici\u00F3n","patrones ecogr\u00E1ficos espec\u00EDficos","facilitar","mediante","an\u00E1lisis","objetivo","detecci\u00F3n","Unidad","inserci\u00F3n segura","contribution","endotracheal tube","correct position","pneumonia","safe cannulation of lines","adapted guide","ARDS","algunas","alternative diagnostic test","verification","Cuidados Intensivos","exploraci\u00F3n","patients","Este documento","RESUMEN","Adem\u00E1s","severe form","physical examination","order","physicians","pandemic","Echocardiography","infection","everyday tool","clinician","description"],"language":"en"},

IL\u201018, a member of the IL\u20101 family, is similar to IL\u20101\u03B2 for being processed by caspase 1 to an 18 kDa\u2010biologically active mature form. IL\u201018 binds to its specific receptor (IL\u201018R\u03B1, also known as IL\u20101R7) forming a low affinity ligand chain. This is followed by recruitment of the IL\u201018R\u03B2 chain. IL\u201018 then uses the same signaling pathway as IL\u20101 to activate NF\u2010kB and induce inflammatory mediators such as adhesion molecules, chemokines and Fas ligand. IL\u201018 also binds to the circulating high affinity IL\u201018 binding protein (BP), such as only unbound free IL\u201018 is active. IL\u201018R\u03B1 may also bind IL\u201037, another member of the IL\u20101 family, but in association with the negative signaling chain termed IL\u20101R8, which transduces an anti\u2010inflammatory signal. IL\u201018BP also binds IL\u201037 and this acts as a sink for the anti\u2010inflammatory properties of IL\u201037. There is now ample evidence for a role of IL\u201018 in various infectious, metabolic or inflammatory diseases such as influenza virus infection, atheroma, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Crohn\u0027s disease. However, IL\u201018 plays a very specific role in the pathogenesis of hemophagocytic syndromes (HS) also termed Macrophage Activation Syndrome. In children affected by NLRC4 gain\u2010of\u2010function mutations, IL\u201018 circulates in the range of tens of nanograms/mL. HS is treated with the IL\u20101 Receptor antagonist (anakinra) but also specifically with IL\u201018BP. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult\u2010onset Still\u0027s disease are also characterized by high serum IL\u201018 concentrations and are treated by IL\u201018BP.","publish_time":"2017-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaplanski, Gilles","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83915d38aca3b16b855c297657e8fbc5d326bd6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165732.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247988/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12616","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","Macrophage Activation Syndrome"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of IL","high serum IL","anti\u2010inflammatory properties of IL","unbound free IL","circulating high affinity IL","binds","Crohn\u0027s disease","specific role","low affinity ligand chain","specific receptor","Macrophage Activation Syndrome","HS","family","R\u03B2 chain","BP","member","R\u03B1","onset Still\u0027s disease","NK cell activation","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","inflammatory diseases","inflammatory mediators","Fas ligand","Receptor antagonist","anti\u2010inflammatory signal","active mature form","myocardial infarction","atheroma","influenza virus infection","adult","adhesion molecules","Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis","binding protein","chemokines","pathogenesis of hemophagocytic syndromes","1R8","\u03B3\u03B4 T cells","NLRC4 gain","kDa","factor","function mutations","sink","negative","1R7","anakinra","concentrations","IFN","Th1","association","interleukin","acts","ample evidence","Th2","range of tens","nanograms","interferon","children","caspase","recruitment","pathway"],"language":"en"},

Two amino acids differed between the S proteins of these viruses; one was located in the signal sequence and the other was in the putative cleavage site. The amino acid at position 12 in the signal sequence was S in MHV-2 and C in MHV-2f. The amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of MHV-2 was HRARS, while that of MHV-2f was HRARR, showing one amino acid replacement at position 757. In DBT cells infected with MHV-2, the S protein was not cleaved, while the S protein of MHV-2f was cleaved. The S protein of MHV-2f expressed in a transient vaccinia virus expression system was cleaved and was fusogenic in contrast to the nonfusogenic activity of uncleaved MHV-2 S protein. Because the signal sequence is assumed to be removed from the mature S protein soon after synthesis, and because the S protein of MHV-2 was expressed on the cell surface in the same way as the S protein of MHV-2f, the difference in the signal sequence seemed to have had little effect on the transportation and the fusion activity of the S protein. These results showed that MHV-2 does not fuse cells due to the lack of cleavage of its S protein. This conclusion differs from studies on the activity of syncytium formation by the S proteins of fusogenic MHV-JHM and -A59 strains. Possible reasons for these differences in fusion activity are discussed.","publish_time":"1997-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"YAMADA, YASUKO K.; TAKIMOTO, KAZUHIRO; YABE, MIKIKO; TAGUCHI, FUMIHIRO","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/503e62e833ac68ac12fc1007d8acb8e22f1221d8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296983130; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296983130","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DBT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S protein of MHV","mature S protein","S proteins of fusogenic MHV-JHM","cleavage site of MHV","nonfusogenic activity of uncleaved MHV","signal sequence","fusion activity","amino acid sequence","amino acid replacement","amino acids","activity of syncytium formation","lack of cleavage","putative cleavage site","position","DBT cells","nonfusogenic murine coronavirus","transient vaccinia virus expression system","HRARR","way","synthesis","variant","studies","differences","transportation","little effect","contrast","Possible reasons","A59 strains","HRARS","cell surface","conclusion","viruses","spike","results"],"language":"en"},

We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazzone, Peter J.; Gould, Michael K.; Arenberg, Douglas A.; Chen, Alexander C.; Choi, Humberto K.; Detterbeck, Frank C.; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M.; Iaccarino, Jonathan M.; Janes, Samuel M.; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Kazerooni, Ella A.; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P.; Powell, Charles A.; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M.

The emergence of HIV in the late 1970s and early 1980s was key in recognizing that surveillance systems specific to blood transfusion were essential. Hence, most industrialized countries monitor transfusion-transmissible infections in donors and evaluate the impact of new testing and of predonation screening strategies. Emerging infections since HIV have had different transmission pathways and challenged blood programs to draw upon resources for a rapid and effective response, with recognition that the original focus on sexual/drug-related risk of HIV and hepatitis was inadequate. The focus of surveillance programs on new and emerging pathogens fulfills a key role in risk assessment and policy formulation.

Many risk factors contribute in the emergence and rapid spread of epidemic diseases in the Region including acute and protracted humanitarian emergencies, resulting in fragile health systems, increased population mobility, rapid urbanization, climate change, weak surveillance and limited laboratory diagnostic capacity, and increased human\u2013animal interaction. In EMR, several infectious disease outbreaks were detected, investigated, and rapidly contained over the past 5 years including: yellow fever in Sudan, Middle East respiratory syndrome in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, cholera in Iraq, avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in Egypt, and dengue fever in Yemen, Sudan, and Pakistan. Dengue fever remains an important public health concern, with at least eight countries in the region being endemic for the disease. The emergence of MERS-CoV in the region in 2012 and its continued transmission currently poses one of the greatest threats. In response to the growing frequency, duration, and scale of disease outbreaks, WHO has worked closely with member states in the areas of improving public health preparedness, surveillance systems, outbreak response, and addressing critical knowledge gaps. A Regional network for experts and technical institutions has been established to facilitate support for international outbreak response. Major challenges are faced as a result of protracted humanitarian crises in the region. Funding gaps, lack of integrated approaches, weak surveillance systems, and absence of comprehensive response plans are other areas of concern. Accelerated efforts are needed by Regional countries, with the continuous support of WHO, to build and maintain a resilient public health system for detection and response to all acute public health events.","publish_time":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buliva, Evans; Elhakim, Mohamed; Tran Minh, Nhu Nguyen; Elkholy, Amgad; Mala, Peter; Abubakar, Abdinasir; Malik, Sk Md Mamunur Rahman","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c736a6c9e4e639e9102e4b95136a53cd99ad2def.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5653925.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29098145/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","United Arab Emirates"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Sudan"],"keyphrases":["public health preparedness","fragile health systems","acute public health events","important public health concern","resilient public health system","global health security","World Health Organization","infectious diseases","weak surveillance systems","international outbreak response","infectious disease outbreaks","dengue fever","Eastern Mediterranean Region","yellow fever","Yemen","Sudan","absence of comprehensive response plans","Regional countries","EMR","areas of concern","scale of disease outbreaks","rapid spread of epidemic diseases","protracted humanitarian emergencies","rapid urbanization","increased human","result of protracted humanitarian crises","Regional network","Funding gaps","emergence of MERS","continuous support","increased population mobility","critical knowledge gaps","climate change","limited laboratory diagnostic capacity","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Qatar","Oman","Bahrain","detection","Saudi Arabia","lack of integrated approaches","United Arab Emirates","cholera","infection","duration","avian influenza","H5N1","Iraq","Egypt","technical institutions","experts","growing frequency","years","animal interaction","Accelerated efforts","priority","hotspot","CoV","risk factors","member states","continued transmission","Major challenges","Pakistan","need","greatest threats"],"language":"en"},

Using molecular methods, several studies have documented that bats could harbor Bartonella. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship of Bartonella spp. identified in bats and small mammals living in the same ecological environment. During May 2009 and March 2010, a total of 102 blood specimens were collected. By whole blood culture and molecular identification, a total of 6 bats, 1 rodent and 9 shrews were shown to be infected by Bartonella species. After sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of gltA, ftsZ, rpoB and ribC genes, these specific isolates from bats were not similar to the known Bartonella species (the similarity values were less than 91.2%, 90.5%, 88.8%, and 82.2%, respectively); these isolates formed an independent clade away from other known Bartonella type strains. The Bartonella spp. isolated from small mammals, which were closely related to Bartonella tribocorum, Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella grahamii, Bartonella rattimassiliensis and Bartonella queenslandensis, were similar to the findings in previous studies worldwide. Therefore, the results implied that the species of Bartonella strains isolated from small mammals were different from those identified in bats. Our results strongly suggested that the bat isolate could be a new Bartonella species. This study is also the first one to isolate Bartonella organisms from Asian gray shrews, Crocidura attenuata tanakae.","publish_time":"2012-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Jen-Wei; Hsu, Yuan-Man; Chomel, Bruno B.; Lin, Liang-Kong; Pei, Jai-Chyi; Wu, Sheng-Hai; Chang, Chao-Chin","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd99f94a203d0769003a64c678ae81a5945e2c62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126237.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.09.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113511005414; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113511005414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartonella","Crocidura"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bartonella grahamii","Bartonella rattimassiliensis","Bartonella elizabethae","Bartonella queenslandensis","Bartonella organisms","Bartonella tribocorum","relationship of Bartonella","known Bartonella species","species of Bartonella strains","new Bartonella species","known Bartonella type strains","bats","small mammals","total","previous studies","results","study","specific isolates","molecular identification","blood culture","bat isolate","molecular methods","blood specimens","Asian gray shrews","sequences of gltA","rpoB","ribC genes","Crocidura attenuata tanakae","important reservoirs","ftsZ","independent clade","phylogenetic analyses","findings","similarity values","sequencing","ecological environment"],"language":"en"},

The molecular basis for this local immune suppression, however, is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin), a recently identified member of the dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) family, in the regulation of hepatic T-cell immune response. Methods The regulation of T-cell effector function by LSECtin was determined by co-stimulated T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody and LSECtin protein, or co-culture of T-cell receptor transgenic T cells with mouse LSECs in vitro. We generated LSECtin knockout mice and prepared recombinant LSECtin protein and complementary DNA plasmids to analyze the role of LSECtin in hepatic T-cell immune regulation in vivo. Results We showed that LSECtin specifically recognized activated T cells and negatively regulated their immune responses. In mice with T-cell\u2013mediated acute liver injury, the lack of LSECtin accelerated the disease owing to an increased T-cell immune response, whereas the exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease via down-regulation of T-cell immunity. Conclusions Our results reveal that LSECtin is a novel regulator of T cells and expose a crucial mechanism for hepatic T-cell immune suppression, perhaps opening up a new approach for treatment of inflammatory diseases in the liver.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Li; Yang, Juntao; Liu, Wanli; Tang, Xiaoming; Chen, Jie; Zhao, Dianyuan; Wang, Min; Xu, Feng; Lu, Yantao; Liu, Biao; Sun, Qihong; Zhang, Lingqiang; He, Fuchu","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e964ffc063efee2c36f553ada701607654a5a898.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127102.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508509012517; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508509012517; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2009.07.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19632227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulation of T","hepatic T-cell immune regulation","hepatic T-cell immune suppression","regulation of hepatic T-cell immune response","increased T-cell immune response","role of LSECtin","activated T cells","cell receptor transgenic T cells","lack of LSECtin","cell immunity","co-culture of T","co-stimulated T cells","novel regulator of T cells","LSECtin knockout mice","prepared recombinant LSECtin protein","cell effector function","immune responses","exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein","dendritic cell-specific ICAM","role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin","hepatic diseases","local immune suppression","results","mediated acute liver injury","treatment of inflammatory diseases","anti-CD3","CD28 monoclonal antibody","complementary DNA plasmids","grabbing nonintegrin","crucial mechanism","mouse LSECs","DC-SIGN","important implications","family","new approach","paradoxic immunologic properties","organ","molecular basis","member","tolerant microenvironment","Methods","Conclusions","Background","study"],"language":"en"},

The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells. ACE2, a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7). We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility. The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta. Therefore, we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission, the possibility of mother-to-child and sexual transmission also exists. Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development. Taking these functions into account, 2019-nCoV may disturb the female reproductive functions through regulating ACE2.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jing, Yan; Run-Qian, Li; Hao-Ran, Wang; Hao-Ran, Chen; Ya-Bin, Liu; Yang, Gao; Fei, Chen","journal":"Molecular human reproduction","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang","Ang II"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of ACE2","expression of ACE2","regulating ACE2","nCoV","female reproductive functions","female reproductive system","levels of angiotensin","renin-angiotensin system","physiological functions","female fertility","embryo development","follicle development","contact transmission","sexual transmission","regular changes","possibility of mother","ovulation","endometrial tissue","binding","luteal angiogenesis","pivotal component","degeneration","child","target cell","ovary","uterus","vagina","placenta","droplets","enzyme","host cells","distribution","potential harm","literature","novel coronavirus","available evidence","account","world"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak has caused alarm among social and news media as to the virulence and transmission potential of the Aedes mosquito-borne virus. This debate is heightened by the proximity, both in time and distance, to the forthcoming Olympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro this August, provoking fears for the safety of athletes and spectators alike. The threat, real or perceived, is exacerbated by the movement between nations in the same or separate continents of persons who act unwittingly as asymptomatic carriers. Pregnant females are considered at greatest risk because microcephaly in newborn infants is linked to, if not yet proven as caused by, Zika infection. In February this year, the World Health Organization declared that further to the then unconfirmed association between the virus and the clinical manifestations of microcephaly and also Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome, the Zika epidemic was a \u201Cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201D. No anti-Zika therapy, vaccine or drug, is currently available and while the production of the former has now been prioritized by multiple funding agencies, the history of infectious disease vaccine development indicates that this may take several years to reach the market place. The fact that Zika is a close relative of yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses, for both of which there are already effective vaccines, provides a rational basis for the fast-tracked laboratory-based preparation of a candidate vaccine. However, undertaking clinical trials on pregnant females provides ethical and practical hurdles to overcome before licensure is granted for public administration. Meanwhile, public health management strategies, including mosquito control programs to reduce breeding, are needed to limit the global spread of this re-emerging disease.","publish_time":"2016-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor-Robinson, Andrew W","journal":"Res Rep Trop Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1694b4f8e456f966ff1fe215161bae59e59148df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6028058.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/rrtm.s108992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050335/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Brazil","Latin America","Rio de Janeiro"],"keyphrases":["Zika epidemic","Zika infection","unexpected emergence of Zika","anti-Zika therapy","public health management strategies","Pregnant females","candidate vaccine","public administration","public health emergency of international concern","clinical manifestations of microcephaly","World Health Organization","history of infectious disease vaccine development","Aedes mosquito","explosive epidemic","clinical trials","re-emerging disease","mosquito control programs","close relative of yellow fever","greatest risk","rational basis","fast-tracked laboratory-based preparation","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","distance","virulence","Japanese encephalitis viruses","practical hurdles","drug","news media","transmission potential","alarm","forthcoming Olympic Games","multiple funding agencies","newborn infants","licensure","east Brazil","Latin America","separate continents of persons","nations","safety of athletes","fears","proximity","Rio","time","effective vaccines","global spread","breeding","fact","unconfirmed association","years","market place","asymptomatic carriers","spectators","Janeiro","outbreak","threat","movement","debate","production","report"],"language":"en"},

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivirals against emerging diseases. We also review the application of recently developed human mAbs against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mAbs as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases.","publish_time":"2017-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Yujia; Lei, Cheng; Hu, Dan; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Ying, Tianlei","journal":"Front Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57c2923f03d28bf138164e56b29bb46c0db7f2e5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29159596/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-017-0596-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["development of mAbs","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","human mAbs","emerging diseases","various diseases","emerging viral diseases","increasing number of mAbs","Antigen-specific mAbs","Ebola virus","disadvantages of various approaches","emerging viruses","different approaches","novel antiviral approaches","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","yeast display","phage display","mAb discovery","mAb production","development of antivirals","transgenic mice","urgent need","global public health","serious challenges","hybridoma","therapeutic agents","historical trends","recent developments","single B-cell isolation","high potency","strategies","potential use","cancer","prospects","emergence of new pathogens","immunological disorders","animal models of infection","paper","Monoclonal antibodies","application"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently presenting in the form of a global pandemic, referred to as COVID-19. In this setting, multiple states have issued executive orders prohibiting \u0022elective\u0022 surgery, including arthroplasty, in order to preserve healthcare resources. However, during this unprecedented reduction in elective surgery, there is likely to be some controversy as to what constitutes a purely \u0022elective\u0022 procedure, versus an \u0022urgent\u0022 procedure, particularly regarding hip arthroplasty. We reviewed the available literature for articles discussing the most commonly encountered indications for primary, conversion, and revision hip arthroplasty. Based upon the indications discussed in these articles, we further stratified these indications into \u0022elective\u0022 versus \u0022urgent\u0022 categories. In patients presenting with hip arthroplasty indications, the decision to proceed urgently with surgery should be based upon (a) the potential harm incurred by the patient if the surgery was delayed and (b) the potential risk incurred by the patient in the context of COVID-19 if surgery was performed. The authors present a decision-making algorithm for determining surgical urgency in three patients who underwent surgery in this context. Urgent total hip arthroplasty in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex decision-making process, involving clinical and epidemiological factors. These decisions are best made in coordination with a multidisciplinary committee of one\u0027s peers. Region-specific issues such as hospital resources and availability of PPE may also inform the decision-making process.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rizkalla, James M; Gladnick, Brian P; Bhimani, Aamir A; Wood, Dorian S; Kitziger, Kurt J; Peters, Paul C","journal":"Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09642-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444993/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hip arthroplasty indications","elective surgery","urgent indications","Urgent total hip arthroplasty","revision hip arthroplasty","encountered indications","context of COVID","unprecedented setting","worldwide COVID","complex decision-making process","decision-making algorithm","patients","global pandemic","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","articles","procedure","available literature","hospital resources","unprecedented reduction","healthcare resources","potential risk","potential harm","conversion","executive orders","availability of PPE","surgical urgency","form","multiple states","RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV","Region-specific issues","epidemiological factors","coordination","multidisciplinary committee","novel coronavirus","peers","authors","categories","decisions","controversy"],"language":"en"},

The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system. Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease.

Of these, 142 subjects were followed for detailed evaluation of acute viral respiratory illness. We examined peripheral blood gene expression at 7 timepoints: enrollment, 5 illness visits and the end of each year of the study. 133 completed all study visits and yielded technically adequate peripheral blood microarray gene expression data. Seventy-three (55%) had an influenza virus infection, 64 influenza A and 9 influenza B. The remaining subjects had a rhinovirus infection (N = 32), other viral infections (N = 4), or no viral agent identified (N = 24). The results, which were replicated between two seasons, showed a dramatic upregulation of interferon pathway and innate immunity genes. This persisted for 2-4 days. The data show a recovery phase at days 4 and 6 with differentially expressed transcripts implicated in cell proliferation and repair. By day 21 the gene expression pattern was indistinguishable from baseline (enrollment). Influenza virus infection induced a higher magnitude and longer duration of the shared expression signature of illness compared to the other viral infections. Using lineage and activation state-specific transcripts to produce cell composition scores, patterns of B and T lymphocyte depressions accompanied by a major activation of NK cells were detected in the acute phase of illness. The data also demonstrate multiple dynamic gene modules that are reorganized and strengthened following infection. Finally, we examined pre- and post-infection anti-influenza antibody titers defining novel gene expression correlates.","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhai, Yijie; Franco, Luis M.; Atmar, Robert L.; Quarles, John M.; Arden, Nancy; Bucasas, Kristine L.; Wells, Janet M.; Ni\u00F1o, Diane; Wang, Xueqing; Zapata, Gladys E.; Shaw, Chad A.; Belmont, John W.; Couch, Robert B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edcbcb53bfb68a6600dc092b57cf09b2a77ac86e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4466531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070066/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004869","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","gene expression pattern","peripheral blood gene expression","acute respiratory viral infections","novel gene expression correlates","rhinovirus infection","acute phase of illness","following infection","viral agent","shared expression signature of illness","adequate peripheral blood microarray gene expression data","detailed evaluation of acute viral respiratory illness","post-infection anti-influenza antibody titers","multiple dynamic gene modules","enrollment","study visits","days","activation state-specific transcripts","cell proliferation","remaining subjects","recovery phase","cell composition scores","major activation of NK cells","patterns of B","longer duration","higher magnitude","T lymphocyte depressions","dramatic upregulation of interferon pathway","timepoints","innate immunity genes","baseline","lineage","systemic response","repair","end","healthy adults","seasons","year","results"],"language":"en"},

The concept and definition of aerosols is also discussed, as is the concept of large droplet transmission, and airborne transmission which is meant by most authors to be synonymous with aerosol transmission, although some use the term to mean either large droplet or aerosol transmission. However, these terms are often used confusingly when discussing specific infection control interventions for individual pathogens that are accepted to be mostly transmitted by the airborne (aerosol) route (e.g. tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox). It is therefore important to clarify such terminology, where a particular intervention, like the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used, is deemed adequate to intervene for this potential mode of transmission, i.e. at an N95 rather than surgical mask level requirement. With this in mind, this review considers the commonly used term of \u2018aerosol transmission\u2019 in the context of some infectious agents that are well-recognized to be transmissible via the airborne route. It also discusses other agents, like influenza virus, where the potential for airborne transmission is much more dependent on various host, viral and environmental factors, and where its potential for aerosol transmission may be underestimated.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tellier, Raymond; Li, Yuguo; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Tang, Julian W.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3af2a50a4711db48012cf6972cb579f85cf1da40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6357359.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704406/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-3707-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airborne transmission","aerosol transmission","potential mode of transmission","concept of large droplet transmission","short-range large-droplet transmission","airborne route","used term","respiratory infectious agents","specific infection control interventions","various host","environmental factors","N95","costs","individual pathogens","type of personal protective equipment","surgical mask level requirement","PPE","types","tuberculosis","context","authors","particular intervention","huge impact","influenza virus","terminology","measles","review","chickenpox","definition of aerosols","mind","terms"],"language":"en"},

With ectodomains of only \u223C20\u201340 residues, it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity, and in their natural biological context of promoting cell\u2013cell fusion, rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins, however, are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cell\u2013cell fusion, but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens, designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been found to contribute to numerous severe clinical symptoms which result in death. The exact mechanism by which EV71 influences miR\u20109 expression is unknown, and the relationship between miR\u20109 and EV71 is still unclear. Here, miR\u20109 expression was found to be impaired upon EV71 infection in several cell lines and in an EV71 infection mouse model. Additionally, we confirmed that EV71 infection induces robust expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03B1, IL\u20106, and IL\u20101) and interferons (IFN\u2010\u03B1 and IFN\u2010\u03B2). Overexpression of miR\u20109 attenuated EV71 proliferation and reduced protein and gene expressions of virion protein 1 (VP1) of EV71. Furthermore, we observed that the inflammation caused by EV71 infection was restored to a moderate level via miR\u20109 overexpression. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03BAB) in the retinoic acid\u2010induced gene 1 (RIG\u2010I) signaling pathway, but not interferon regulating factor 3 (IRF3), was significantly decreased and inactivated by ectopic miR\u20109 expression. Moreover, in mouse infection experiments, administration of miR\u20109 agomirs caused a significant decrease in VP1 levels and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine production after viral inoculation. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that miR\u20109 exerts an anti\u2010EV71 effect in cells and a mouse model via mediating NF\u03BAB activity of the RIG\u2010I signal pathway, thereby suggesting a new candidate for antiviral drug development.","publish_time":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Bing; Zheng, Junqing","journal":"FEBS Open Bio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/620c2d071dd49eb5bcc31f378eb219310e4b1ebc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6120239.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.12490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV71 influences miR","Overexpression of miR","EV71 infection mouse model","administration of miR","ectopic miR","attenuated EV71 proliferation","anti\u2010EV71 effect","mouse infection experiments","robust expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines","IFN","RIG","pathway","IL","pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine production","reduced protein","VP1 levels","gene expressions of virion protein","induced gene","mediating NF\u03BAB activity","Nuclear factor kappa B","significant decrease","cells","TNF","cell lines","new candidate","viral inoculation","retinoic acid","agomirs","moderate level","microRNA","antiviral drug development","interferons","numerous severe clinical symptoms","exact mechanism","relationship","causative link","hsa","death","IRF3","pathophysiological processes","present data","inflammation","Accumulating evidence","Enterovirus"],"language":"en"},

A serious limitation of sequence similarity-based approaches for identifying residue conservation among proteins is the low confidence in assigning residue-residue correspondences among proteins when the level of sequence identity between the compared proteins is poor. Multiple sequence alignment methods are more satisfactory--still, they cannot provide reliable results at low levels of sequence identity. Our goal in the current work was to develop an algorithm that could help overcome these difficulties by facilitating the identification of structurally (and possibly functionally) relevant residue-residue correspondences between compared protein structures. RESULTS: Here we present StralSV (structure-alignment sequence variability), a new algorithm for detecting closely related structure fragments and quantifying residue frequency from tight local structure alignments. We apply StralSV in a study of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus, and we demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to determine regions of the protein that are relatively unique, or that share structural similarity with proteins that would be considered distantly related. By quantifying residue frequencies among many residue-residue pairs extracted from local structural alignments, one can infer potential structural or functional importance of specific residues that are determined to be highly conserved or that deviate from a consensus. We further demonstrate that considerable detailed structural and phylogenetic information can be derived from StralSV analyses. CONCLUSIONS: StralSV is a new structure-based algorithm for identifying and aligning structure fragments that have similarity to a reference protein. StralSV analysis can be used to quantify residue-residue correspondences and identify residues that may be of particular structural or functional importance, as well as unusual or unexpected residues at a given sequence position.

In our previous studies, the proteinase was identified as a 33-kDa protein in IBV-infected cells, and its catalytic center was shown to consist of H2820 and C2922 residues. It is released from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins by autoprocessing at two Q\u2013S dipeptide bonds (Q2779\u2013S2780 and Q3086\u2013S3087). In this report, further characterization of the two cleavage sites demonstrates that the N-terminal Q2779\u2013S2780 site is tolerant to mutations at the P1 position. Deletion of the C-terminal region of the proteinase shows that a significant amount of the enzymatic activity is maintained upon deletion of up to 67 amino acids, suggesting that the extreme C-terminal region may be dispensable for the proteolytic activity of the proteinase. Analysis of the autoprocessing kinetics in vitro reveals that proteolysis at the Q2779\u2013S2780 site is the first cleavage event mediated by this proteinase. This is followed by cleavage at the Q3086\u2013S3087 site. The occurrence of both cleavage events in intact cells is potentially rapid and efficient, as no intermediate cleavage products covering the proteinase were detected in either IBV-infected or transfected cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies further show differential subcellular localization of the proteinase in IBV-infected cells and in cells expressing the 3C-like proteinase alone, indicating that additional roles in viral replication might be played by this protein. Finally, a Q\u2013A (Q3379\u2013A3380) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 10,663 to 10,668 was demonstrated to be a cleavage site of the proteinase.","publish_time":"2000-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Lisa F.P.; Liu, D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All hospitals and their associated laboratories participating in the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv\u2010NET) were included in this evaluation. The network covers more than 80 counties in 15 states, CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, TN, IA, MI, OH, RI, and UT, with a catchment population of ~28 million people. We administered a standardized questionnaire to key personnel, including infection control practitioners and laboratory departments, at each hospital through telephone interviews. RESULTS: Of the 240 participating laboratories, 67% relied only on commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests to diagnose influenza. Few reported the availability of molecular diagnostic assays for detection of influenza (26%) and other viral pathogens (\u226420%) in hospitals and commercial laboratories.

Our study was aimed at estimating the prevalence of dental caries and identifying key associated factors in four major risk domains, including socioeconomic factors, child oral health behavior and practices, child feeding practices, and dietary habits among primary school children in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to recruit 578 male Saudi primary school children, aged 6\u20138 years, from 12 primary schools in five different regions of Riyadh. Children were clinically screened to detect carious lesions in primary teeth according to World Health Organization\u2019s criteria. Structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on social and individual factors from the parents. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of associated factors for dental caries were computed using logistic regression models; key factors were identified by systematic selection process that accounted for multicollinearity and bias correction. RESULTS: Dental caries was prevalent among children (83%, 95% confidence interval 79.7\u201386.0%). Individual factors, including irregular brushing, late adoption of brushing habit, consulting dentist for symptomatic treatment, lack of breast feeding, sleeping with a bottle in mouth, habit of snacking between meals, low consumption of fruits, and frequent consumption of soft drinks and flavored milk, were predominantly associated with dental caries in children, instead of socioeconomic factors (p \u003C 0.05, adjusted R-square 80%). CONCLUSION: Dental caries were prevalent in school children, and individual factors were predominantly associated with the disease.

PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, since 2013\u20132014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets. At present, differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is essential to control viral diarrheas in US swine. Cell culture-adapted US PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) strains have been isolated and propagated by us and in several other laboratories. TC-PDCoV strains will be useful to develop serologic assays and to evaluate if serial cell-culture passage attenuates TC-PDCoV as a potential vaccine candidate strain. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of epidemic PDCoV strains is currently needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine. This review focuses on the etiology, cell culture isolation and propagation, molecular epidemiology, disease mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.","publish_time":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil; Hu, Hui; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2497aa3d6369d40ea02f64f3d81d360f81bd0dcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114557.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.04.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216301563; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216301563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27086031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV diarrhea","PDCoV infections","origin of PDCoV","emerged PDCoV","TC-PDCoV strains","current US PDCoV strains","pathogenesis of PDCoV infection","Cell culture-adapted US PDCoV","epidemiology of epidemic PDCoV strains","differential diagnosis of PDCoV","US swine","acute diarrhea","PEDV infections","severe diarrhea","cell culture isolation","family Coronaviridae","serial cell-culture passage","genus Deltacoronavirus","co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","dehydration","vomiting","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","potential cause of death","molecular epidemiology","novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","disease mechanisms","viral RNA","viral diarrheas","genus Alphacoronavirus","potential vaccine candidate strain","nursing piglets","effective vaccine","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","severe atrophic enteritis","seronegative neonatal piglets","primary sites of infection","propagation","villous epithelial cells","jejunum","ileum","transient viremia","mortality","large intestines","high number of pig deaths","significant economic impacts","TGEV","etiology","sudden emergence","route of introduction","serologic assays","pigs","affected regions","comprehensive understanding","present","review","laboratories"],"language":"en"},

Current molecular diagnostic tools mainly rely on the specific amplification of marker sequences and may overlook infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; but, due to the extremely low fraction of pathogen genetic material in clinical samples, its application is only cost-effective in special, rather than routine, cases. In this study, we present a method for the semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in a HTS library by hybridization in solution with genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Moreover, enterovirus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Enterovirus) sequences were successfully enriched using foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Aphthovirus) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to the background nucleic acid was about 1,000-fold. As hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide match requirements than PCR, few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover the potential sequence variation in the whole genus and may even enrich nucleic acids of viruses of other related genera. Efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes its use in diagnostics cost-efficient.","publish_time":"2017-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deviatkin, Andrei A.; Lukashev, Alexander N.; Markelov, Mikhail M.; Gmyl, Larisa V.; Shipulin, German A.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b27ff0413a44ae5dbf31118ad0e008bc72058a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5575070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-10342-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28852181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Efficient enrichment of viral sequences","genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides","semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences","nucleic acids of viruses","specific amplification of marker sequences","Picornaviridae","hybridization","family","rare pathogens","enterovirus","yellow fever virus","Japanese encephalitis virus","mouth disease virus","enrichment factor relative","pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides","background nucleic acid","rare human pathogens","knowledge of potential","test viruses","HTS library","solution hybrid selection","potential sequence variation","stringent oligonucleotide match requirements","clinical samples","PCR","low fraction of pathogen genetic material","application","infections","method","foot","Aphthovirus","Current molecular diagnostic tools","diagnostics cost-efficient","related genera","routine","high-throughput sequencing","recent advances","cases","fold","study","problem"],"language":"en"},

When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed.

Complete clearance of unwanted entities may involve both innate and adaptive leukocyte responses, which influence each other. Some innate mechanisms require no induction and are completely non-specific, whereas others are inducible and involve broad receptor-mediated recognition of a limited number of pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs). Adaptive responses involve the selective activation of lymphocytes via engagement of their antigen receptors by a specific foreign antigen. The three major subsets of lymphocytes are T helper cells (Th), cytotoxic T cells (Tc) and B cells, which use distinct mechanisms to recognize antigen and carry out different effector functions. Immune system malfunction can contribute to many clinical illnesses including autoimmune disorders, allergies, immunodeficiencies, chronic inflammation and cancer.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Primer to the Immune Response","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6efbfa215a506d5fbc448dbbf82dcb4661b38149.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184560.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123852458000017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123852458000017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Immune responses","Adaptive responses","T helper cells","cytotoxic T cells","B cells","antigen receptors","Immune system malfunction","adaptive leukocyte responses","innate mechanisms","cancer","specific foreign antigen","distinct mechanisms","receipt of soluble proteins","intercellular messenger proteins","selective activation of lymphocytes","major subsets of lymphocytes","coordinated action of leukocytes","allergies","immunodeficiencies","autoimmune disorders","clinical illnesses","broad receptor-mediated recognition","damage","production","vital role","engagement","Tc","limited number of pathogen","chronic inflammation","trauma","molecular patterns","PAMPs","infection","body","direct contact","cytokines","Complete clearance of unwanted entities","human health","DAMPs","threats","toxins"],"language":"en"},

Gilts received daily oral retinyl acetate (30 000 IU) starting at gestation day 76 throughout lactation. At 3\u20134 weeks pre-partum, VA-supplemented (PEDV \u002B VA) and non-supplemented (PEDV) gilts were PEDV or mock inoculated (mock \u002B VA and mock, respectively). PEDV \u002B VA gilts had decreased mean PEDV RNA shedding titers and diarrhea scores. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3\u20135 days post-partum. The survival rate of PEDV \u002B VA litters was 74.2% compared with 55.9% in PEDV litters. Mock and mock \u002B VA litter survival rates were 5.7% and 8.3%, respectively.

In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. Conclusion In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braunstein, Lior Z.; Gillespie, Erin F.; Hong, Linda; Xu, Amy; Bakhoum, Samuel F.; Cuaron, John; Mueller, Boris; McCormick, Beryl; Cahlon, Oren; Powell, Simon; Khan, Atif J.","journal":"Adv Radiat Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c738a511a9c18e7e831b40f1ec3605fe4cdeb6d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118660.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420300658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292842/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420300658?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy","infection risk","oncologic risk","abbreviated breast radiation regimens","certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients","parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy","omitting radiation","Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts","Abstract Introduction Breast radiotherapy accounts","place patients","widespread pandemic","competing mortality risk","application of hypofractionated","post-mastectomy radiation","COVID","high-volume comprehensive cancer center","contemporary radiation oncology practice","setting of anticipated resource constraints","widespread community infection","relevant literature","resource utilization","accelerating regimens","Substantial evidence","significant clinical burden","growing body of literature","various hypofractionated approaches","significant proportion of patient volume","long term oncologic outcomes","present evidence-based guidelines","contingency planning meetings","critical healthcare resources","potential","early days","regional lymph nodes","personalized use of immature study data","coverage","SARS-CoV","measures","balancing","public health emergency","recommendations","effort","providers","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Although considerable effort has been placed on assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing, to date quality assessment of the subsequent peptide abundance data matrix has been limited to a subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation or individual peptide components. Identifying statistical outliers is a critical step in the processing of proteomics data as many of the downstream statistical analyses [e.g. analysis of variance (ANOVA)] rely upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and their results are influenced by extreme values. Results: We describe a novel multivariate statistical strategy for the identification of LC-MS runs with extreme peptide abundance distributions. Comparison with current method (run-by-run correlation) demonstrates a significantly better rate of identification of outlier runs by the multivariate strategy. Simulation studies also suggest that this strategy significantly outperforms correlation alone in the identification of statistically extreme liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runs.

Hippocrates (460 B.C.\u2013370 B.C.) coined the terms endemic and epidemic, John Graunt (1620\u20131674) introduced systematic data analysis, Samuel Pepys (1633\u20131703) started epidemic field investigation, William Farr (1807\u20131883) founded the modern concept of surveillance, John Snow (1813\u20131858) linked data to intervention, and Alexander Langmuir (1910\u20131993) gave the first comprehensive definition of surveillance. Current theories, principles, and practice of public health surveillance are summarized. A number of surveillance dichotomies, such as epidemiologic surveillance versus public health surveillance, are described. Some future scenarios are presented, while current activities that can affect the future are summarized: exploring new frontiers; enhancing computer technology; improving epidemic investigations; improving data collection, analysis, dissemination, and use; building on lessons from the past; building capacity; enhancing global surveillance.

Study Design A multi-center cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020 when the coronavirus epidemic was publically announced and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended EPDS was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre and post study groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of COVID-19 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=0.02) than women assess pre-epidemic announcement. These women were also more likely to endorse thoughts of self-harm (P=0.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases (P=0.003), suspected infections (P=0.004), and death cases per day (P=0.001). Pregnant women who were underweight pre-pregnancy, primiparous, \u003C 35 years old, employed full-time, middle income, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk to develop depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the COVID-19 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yanting; Zhang, Chen; Liu, Han; Duan, Chenchi; Li, Cheng; Fan, Jianxia; Li, Hong; Chen, Lei; Xu, Hualin; Li, Xiangjuan; Guo, Yi; Wang, Yeping; Li, Xiufeng; Li, Jing; Zhang, Ting; You, Yiping; Li, Hongmei; Yang, Shuangqi; Tao, Xiaoling; Xu, Yajuan; Lao, Haihong; Wen, Ming; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Junying; Chen, Yuhua; Meng, Diyun; Zhai, Jingli; Ye, Youchun; Zhong, Qinwen; Yang, Xiuping; Zhang, Dan; Zhang, Jing; Wu, Xifeng; Chen, Wei; Dennis, Cindy-Lee; Huang, Hefeng","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2edd07ec49a015d0331736dc9e183262a3825d7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820305342; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437665/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305342?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Design"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["mental status of pregnant women","mental health response of pregnant women","outbreak","anxiety symptoms","present study","depressive rates","impact of COVID","declaration of COVID","mental health concerns","increased risk","preventative mental health strategies","mental illness","prevalence of depressive","higher rates of depressive symptoms","China","pre-epidemic announcement","corresponding risk factors","post study groups","new coronavirus epidemic","multi-center cross-sectional study","Prevalence rates","effective risk communication","pre-pregnancy","maternal depression","thoughts of self-harm","human","Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events","maternal stress","recommended EPDS","death cases","significant public panic","Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale","middle income","isolation","special need","appropriate living space","years old","provision of psychological","Chinese government","negative outcomes","unique opportunity","trimester","aid","hospitals","provinces","transmission","Objective","aim","fetuses","day","suspected infections","vs","pivotal time point","number","reports","total","Abstract Background"],"language":"en"},

Ultimately, PEDV has been associated with devastating outbreaks in pig farms. We developed a stochastic simulation model to carry out a quantitative risk assessment and to estimate the annual probability (PPlasma) of introducing PEDV into the Danish pig population, by imported spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP). The model was based on information from literature and Danish feed companies. Moreover testing the batch of raw blood (before the spray-drying) was considered as potential risk mitigation measure in the future. RESULTS: The median PPlasma was 0.2 % (90 % P.I.: 0.003 %; 2.6 %). Hence, the annual probability of introducing PEDV into the Danish pig population by imported SDPP appeared very low, and on average at least one introduction each 500 years \u2013 corresponding to 1/0.002 - could be expected. However, if PEDV survived the spray-drying process and storage was insufficient to completely remove the remaining viable virus (e.g. due to storage at low environmental temperatures during a short time period) the PPlasma was 4.7 % (0.06 %; 57.4 %). In that case, on average, at least one PEDV introduction each 21 years could be expected. This probability could be reduced to 0.3 % (0.004 %; 6.0 %) if the raw batch of blood could be tested before drying (corresponding to at least one introduction each 333 years on average). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary and important information on the probability of introducing PEDV into the Danish pig population by use of SDPP. Currently PED is not a notifiable disease in the EU and uncertainty was present in our estimates due to possible underreporting in EU Member States, from which SDPP is imported into Denmark. In the future, PED might become a notifiable disease, and in such a case, new knowledge could become available on its epidemiology. Moreover, SDPP could be imported more safely if: producers find a way to substantiate freedom from disease (at least) in herds delivering blood for SDPP, the batch of blood tests negative for PEDV and conditions for processing/storage required by the international laws are respected.","publish_time":"2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foddai, Alessandro; Nielsen, Lisbeth Harm; M\u00F8gelmose, Vibeke; Alban, Lis","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d55a99be0e217434aa3a7bfafb4d83c83d12525.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382482.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405424/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-015-0010-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","SDPP","PED","EU"],"locations":["Asia","North America","Europe","Denmark"],"keyphrases":["PEDV introduction","Danish pig population","use of SDPP","storage","annual probability","batch of raw blood","raw batch of blood","average","years","batch of blood tests","pig farms","notifiable disease","spray-drying process","Danish feed companies","future","median PPlasma","case","Denmark","spray-dried porcine plasma","important information","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","EU Member States","low environmental temperatures","quantitative risk assessment","remaining viable virus","stochastic simulation model","potential risk mitigation measure","short time period","possible underreporting","estimates","uncertainty","literature","conditions","study","BACKGROUND","processing","devastating outbreaks","new knowledge","Europe","Asia","North America","freedom","way","herds","international laws","producers","epidemiology","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It has been observed that numerous viral proteins can oligomerize and form structures known as viroporins that alter the permeability of membranes. Previous findings have identified such proteins in cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the same family that Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to (Flaviviridae). In the present work, we investigated whether the small hydrophobic DENV protein NS2B serves a viroporin function. METHODS: We cloned the DENV NS2B sequence and expressed it in a bacterial expression system. Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of DENV NS2B on membranes when NS2B was overexpressed, measured bacterial growth restriction, and evaluated changes of permeability to hygromycin. The NS2B protein was purified by affinity chromatography, and crosslinking assays were performed to determine the presence of oligomers. Hemolysis assays and transmission electron microscopy were performed to identify structures involved in permeability changes. RESULTS: The DENV-2 NS2B protein showed similitude with the JEV viroporin. The DENV-2 NS2B protein possessed the ability to change the membrane permeability in bacteria, to restrict bacterial cell growth, and to enable membrane permeability to hygromycin B. The NS2B protein formed trimers that could participate in cell lysis and generate organized structures on eukaryotes membranes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the DENV-2 NS2B viral protein is capable of oligomerizing and organizing to form pore-like structures in different lipid environments, thereby modifying the permeability of cell membranes.","publish_time":"2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le\u00F3n-Ju\u00E1rez, Mois\u00E9s; Mart\u00EDnez-Castillo, Macario; Shrivastava, Gaurav; Garc\u00EDa-Cordero, Julio; Villegas-Sepulveda, Nicol\u00E1s; Mondrag\u00F3n-Castel\u00E1n, M\u00F3nica; Mondrag\u00F3n-Flores, Ricardo; Cedillo-Barr\u00F3n, Leticia","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e08edfdafcee24569ce5be73cec8acb26142ba8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4700614.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26728778/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0456-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS2B protein","permeability of membranes","NS2B viral protein","DENV NS2B sequence","effect of DENV NS2B","membrane permeability","permeability of cell membranes","small hydrophobic DENV protein NS2B","permeability changes","evaluated changes of permeability","form structures","cellular membranes","eukaryotes membranes","bacterial cell growth","organized structures","virus infection","Dengue virus","bacterial growth restriction","JEV viroporin","hygromycin","cell lysis","Japanese encephalitis virus","numerous viral proteins","bacterial expression system","Hemolysis assays","viroporin function","crosslinking assays","cells","affinity chromatography","trimers","transmission electron microscopy","similitude","main phenomena","capable of oligomerizing","different lipid environments","pore","member","family","viroporins","Previous findings","BACKGROUND","data","METHODS","RESULTS","present work","presence of oligomers","CONCLUSIONS","Flaviviridae"],"language":"en"},

Methods A 2-year surveillance program of children presenting with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was carried out to characterize the viral etiology and to assess whether using gene amplification and sequencing could be a reliable approach to monitor virus introduction and spread in a population subgroup. Results Using multiplex RT-PCR, 15 different respiratory viruses were detected within the 486 nasopharyngeal positive samples collected among 817 children aged \u003C9-year old who presented with ARI during October 2006 to September 2008. A single virus was detected in 373 patients (45.7%), and two to four viruses in 113 patients (13.8%). The most frequent causative viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24.7%), human bocavirus (24.5%), and human rhinovirus (HRV) (15%). RSV was more prevalent in winter and among young infants. Cases of seasonal influenza A and B viruses were reported mainly in January and August. An increase in adenovirus infection was observed during the spring of the second year of the study. Sequence analyses showed multiple introductions of different virus subtypes and identified a high prevalence of the newly defined HRV-C species. A higher viral incidence was observed during the winter of 2008, which was unusually cold.

However, their implementation usually requires an extended consultation time. Despite significant advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness in Korea. METHODS: We conducted a \u201C15-Minute Consultation\u201D for first-time patients in outpatient clinics of 13 departments. A control group was selected from the same physicians\u0027 first-time patients, adjusting for age and gender. A total of 275 patients were selected for receiving in-depth consultation and 141 control patients were selected for regular consultation. Data were collected from patients using a questionnaire comprising a patient-centeredness scale and items on potential predictors such as socio-demographic and clinical factors. We also investigated the participating physician\u0027s professionalism. RESULTS: As compared to the control group, the in-depth consultation group scored higher on 5 variables associated with PCC, including (patients\u0027 perception of) medical professionals, wait and consultation times, treatment, patient advocacy, and patient satisfaction. While 92.4% of patients in the in-depth consultation group reported that the consultation time was sufficient, only 69.0% of those in the control group reported the same (P \u003C 0.01). In the in-depth consultation group, scores on satisfaction level were the highest for the department of internal medicine, followed by departments of surgery and pediatrics. Participating physicians\u0027 improved satisfaction following the intervention proved that in-depth consultation facilitated building a rapport with patients.

We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication.

Currently, there are no drugs available for the prevention and treatment of HFMD. In this study, we compared the anti-EV71 activities of three natural compounds, rheum emodin, artemisinin and astragaloside extracted from Chinese herbs Chinese rhubarb, Artemisia carvifolia and Astragalus, respectively, which have been traditionally used for the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases. Human lung fibroblast cell line MRC5 was mock-infected or infected with EV71, and treated with drugs. The cytotoxicity of the drugs was detected with MTT assay. The cytopathic effects such as cell death and condensed nuclei were morphologically observed. The VP1-coding sequence required for EV71 genome replication was assayed with qRT-PCR. Viral protein expression was analyzed with Western blotting. Viral TCID50 was determined to evaluate EV71 virulence. Flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide staining was performed to analyze the cell cycle distribution of MRC5 cells. Rheum emodin (29.6 \u03BCmol/L) effectively protected MRC5 cells from EV71-induced cytopathic effects, which resulted from the inhibiting viral replication: rheum emodin treatment decreased viral genomic levels by 5.34-fold, viral protein expression by less than 30-fold and EV71 virulence by 0.33107-fold. The fact that inhibition of rheum emodin on viral virulence was much stronger than its effects on genomic levels and viral protein expression suggested that rheum emodin inhibited viral maturation. Furthermore, rheum emodin treatment markedly diminished cell cycle arrest at S phase in MRC5 cells, which was induced by EV71 infection and favored the viral replication. In contrast, neither astragaloside (50 \u03BCmol/L) nor artemisinin (50 \u03BCmol/L) showed similar anti-EV71 activities. Among the three natural compounds tested, rheum emodin effectively suppressed EV71 viral replication, thus is a candidate anti-HFMD drug.","publish_time":"2016-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Ting; Zhang, Li-ying; Wang, Zeng-yan; Wang, Yue; Song, Feng-mei; Zhang, Ya-hong; Yu, Jing-hua","journal":"Acta Pharmacologica Sinica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03906ffef2d37362b598ee88ce3f13e7aebe6011.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5342659.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840410/; https://doi.org/10.1038/aps.2016.110; https://www.nature.com/articles/aps2016110.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD","MTT"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["viral virulence","EV71 virulence","suppressed EV71 viral replication","rheum emodin treatment","Viral TCID50","viral maturation","EV71 infection","Viral protein expression","inhibition of rheum emodin","inhibiting viral replication","EV71 genome replication","viral genomic levels","similar anti-EV71 activities","treatment of HFMD","fold","\u03BCmol","cell cycle distribution of MRC5 cells","protected MRC5 cells","cell death","cytopathic effects","Human lung fibroblast cell line MRC5","diminished cell cycle arrest","natural compounds","astragaloside","artemisinin","candidate anti-HFMD drug","drugs available","Chinese herbs Chinese rhubarb","mock-infected","Human enterovirus","prevention of epidemic diseases","foot","S phase","primary causative agent of recent large-scale outbreaks of hand","Artemisia carvifolia","Flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide staining","mouth disease","VP1-coding sequence","Astragalus","condensed nuclei","Western blotting","Asia","qRT-PCR","fact","MTT assay","contrast","study","cytotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

We found 11 unusual cases in Macao, which showed characteristics of CRF12_BF (n =2) and CRF14_BG (n =8), and one that could not be classified into an existing subtype/CRF, along with three cases of CRF01_AE. Interestingly, the sequences derived from subtypes BG and BF recombinants have not been previously reported in any other Asian cities. Another subtype, CRF14_BG, has also been introduced into Macao among the IDUs.

Due to their phylogenetic distance, mechanisms of immune diversification and the way in which they deposit IgY immunoglobulin in the egg yolk, chickens provide a number of advantages compared to mammals as hosts for immunization. These advantages include: the one-step purification of antibodies from egg yolk in large amounts facilitates having a virtually continuous supply; the epitope spectrum of avian antibodies potentially grants access to novel specificities; the broad absence of cross-reactivity with mammalian epitopes avoids assay interference and improves the performance of immunological techniques. The polyclonal nature of IgY antibodies has limited their use since avian hybridoma techniques are not well established. Recombinant IgY, however, can be generated from mammalian monoclonal antibodies which makes it possible to further exploit the advantageous properties of the IgY scaffold. Moreover, cloning and selecting the immune repertoire from avian organisms is highly efficient, yielding antigen-specific antibody fragments. The recombinant approach is well suited to circumvent any limitations of polyclonal antibodies.

Based on these similarities, and the proposed involvement of channel activity as virulence factor in SARS-CoV E protein, MERS-CoV E protein may constitute a potential drug target.","publish_time":"2015-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Surya, Wahyu; Li, Yan; Verdi\u00E0-B\u00E0guena, Carmina; Aguilella, Vicente M.; Torres, Jaume","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9741e8ea0b57687e7d63d3c472b02ad24a383f35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25733052/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215001136; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.02.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215001136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV E protein","SARS-CoV E protein","E-deleted viruses","MERS virus","case of SARS","abolishment of channel activity","proposed involvement of channel activity","potential vaccine","single \u03B1-helical transmembrane domain","potential drug target","virulence factor","forms pentameric ion channels","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lipid bilayers","identified pathogen able of human transmission","attenuation","contributor","cases","mortality","similarities"],"language":"en"},

Disinfection guidelines specify that drinking water with turbidity \u22651 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) is not suitable for disinfection and therefore not fit for purpose. Treated wastewater typically has higher concentrations of particles (1\u201310NTU for secondary treated effluent). Two processes widely used for disinfecting wastewater are chlorination and ultraviolet radiation. In both cases, particles in wastewater can interfere with disinfection and can significantly increase treatment costs by increasing operational expenditure (chemical demand, power consumption) or infrastructure costs by requiring additional treatment processes to achieve the required levels of pathogen inactivation. Many microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, protozoans) associate with particles, which can allow them to survive disinfection processes and cause a health hazard. Improved understanding of this association will enable development of cost-effective treatment, which will become increasingly important as indirect and direct potable reuse of wastewater becomes more widespread in both developed and developing countries. This review provides an overview of wastewater and associated treatment processes, the pathogens in wastewater, the nature of particles in wastewater and how they interact with pathogens, and how particles can impact disinfection processes.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chahal, C.; van den Akker, B.; Young, F.; Franco, C.; Blackbeard, J.; Monis, P.","journal":"Advances in Applied Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34eb329f2f34b1ed2f0c7312de0f3075adfb57a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27926432/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aambs.2016.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065216416300971; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065216416300971","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disinfection processes","Treated wastewater","disinfecting wastewater","overview of wastewater","nature of particles","additional treatment processes","associated treatment processes","Abstract Disinfection guidelines","treatment costs","direct potable reuse of wastewater","high numbers of particles","higher concentrations of particles","potable water","recycled water","drinking water","development of cost-effective treatment","NTU","pathogens","guidelines problematic","infrastructure costs","required levels of pathogen inactivation","Nephelometric Turbidity Units","secondary treated effluent","power consumption","operational expenditure","chemical demand","association","bacteria","protozoans","viruses","chlorination","ultraviolet radiation","microorganisms","compliance","health hazard","Improved understanding","review","cases","countries","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020. Results Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8%) were male. Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8%)], cough [102(81.6%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6%)]. Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4%) patients. 100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. All patients were given antiviral therapy. 19(15.2%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. By February 18, 47(37.6%) patients were discharged and none of patients died. Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16). Conclusion In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom. Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition. Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ruirui; Pan, Min; Zhang, Xiumei; Fan, Xiaoyun; Han, Mingfeng; Zhao, Fengde; Miao, Manli; Xu, Jing; Guan, Minglong; Deng, Xia; Chen, Xu; Shen, Leilei","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c01c8ecce063ec5b15fd9012ca7bca3a06c0dbe3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151431.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302034?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289565/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.070","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Anhui","China"],"keyphrases":["discharged patients","clinical features of patients","radiological findings of patients","patients infected SARS-CoV","descriptive study","fever","SD","laboratory data","Old age","mean age","Clinical outcomes","Common symptoms","Certain laboratory inspection","smoking history","chronic underlying diseases","manifestations","stay","multiple mottling","retrospective","demographic","median time of length","COVID","real-time RT-PCR","single-center","ground-glass opacity","factors","judgment","People\u2019s Hospital of Fuyang City","Anhui province of China","days","years","Results","intensive care unit","worse condition","Abstract Objective","severity of illness","Conclusion","Method","bilateral pneumonia","antiviral therapy","shortness of breath","male","cough","Lymphocytopenia"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to determine the current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene, and the potential risk factors of diarrhoea in a residential community of Singapore. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted within a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to August 2013. A total of 1,156 household units were randomly sampled and invited to participate in an interviewer-assisted survey using standardised questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, Fisher\u2019s Exact test and multivariate logistic regression modelling, respectively. R program was used for all statistical analysis. All tests were conducted at 5 % level of significance with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) reported where applicable. RESULTS: A total of 240 units (20.8 %) consented and responded to the survey invitation. About 77 % of the expected knowledge and attitude were observed in at least 80 % of the participants, compared to only about 31 % of the expected behaviours and practises. Being single [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.29; 95 % CI = 1.16-4.48], having flu in the past six month (AOR = 3.24; 95 % CI = 1.74-6.06), preferred self-medication (AOR = 2.07; 95 % CI = 1.06\u20134.12) were risk factors of diarrhoea. Washing hands with water before attending to children or sick persons (AOR = 0.30; 95 % CI = 0.11\u20130.82), washing hands with water (AOR = 0.16; 95 % CI = 0.05\u20130.45) and water with soap (AOR = 0.29; 95 % CI = 0.12\u20130.72) after attending to children or sick persons, and hand washing between 30 s to a minute (AOR = 0.44; 95 % CI = 0.20-0.90) were protective factors against diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge and attitude of the participants did not positively translate into high compliance and motivation to perform good hygiene practices. This observation may have resulted in a significant extent on the increasing diarrhoea incidences. Current interventions may be improved with more active community partnership among the residents, schools and the relevant social organizations, to raise awareness on the importance of compliance to good hygiene practices, and the risk factors of diarrhoea. A large case\u2013control study would be required to validate these findings in future.

Here, we report that miR-142-5p is localized to neurons and negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis in porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (PHE). This phenotype was mediated by miR-142-5p inhibition of an mRNA encoding unc-51-like-kinase1 (Ulk1), which controls axon outgrowth and dendrite formation. Modulating miR-142-5p activity by microRNA mimics or inhibitors induced neurodegeneration, including stunted axon elongation, unstable dendritic spine formation, and irregular swelling and disconnection in neurites. Relieving Ulk1 mRNA repression in primary cortical neurons by miR-142-5p antagomirs or replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding Ulk1 (Ad5-Ulk1), which improved rescue of nerve injury, restricted viral replication, and increased survival rate in mice underlying PHEV infection. In contrast, disrupting Ulk1 in RNAi-expressing neurons mostly led to significantly shortened axon elongation and/or an abnormally large number of branched dendrites. Taken together, we demonstrated that the abnormal neuronal morphogenesis underlying PHEV infection was mainly caused by functional mRNA repression of the miR-142-5p target Ulk1. Our data revealed that PHEV adapted to use spatiotemporal control of host microRNAs to invade CNS, and provided new insights into the virus-associated neurological dysfunction microenvironment.","publish_time":"2017-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zi; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Lv, Xiaoling; Ding, Ning; Lu, Huijun; Zhang, Jing; Yue, Huiqing; Shi, Junchao; Song, Deguang; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eabfb15b60476742917f92c6fb60a7bc6ec203aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5413507.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28516065/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p target Ulk1","Ad5-Ulk1","Relieving Ulk1 mRNA repression","p activity","p antagomirs","p inhibition","Modulating miR","abnormal neuronal morphogenesis underlying PHEV infection","CNS","stunted axon elongation","functional mRNA repression","Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","axon outgrowth","primary cortical neurons","neurological dysfunction microenvironment","dendrite formation","restricted viral replication","replication-deficient adenoviruses","unstable dendritic spine formation","increased survival rate","inhibitors","irregular swelling","neurodegeneration","rescue of nerve injury","understanding","microRNA mimics","mice","central nervous system","neurodegenerative disease","spatiotemporal control of host microRNAs","suckling piglets","disconnection","neuropathogenicity","new insights","large number of branched dendrites","neurites","RNAi","contrast","kinase1","data","phenotype"],"language":"en"},

First, overexpression of VP56 inhibited the IFN production induced by the polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), while the capacity of IRF7 on IFN induction was unaffected. Second, VP56 interacted with RLRs but did not affect the stabilization of the proteins in the normal state, while the phosphorylated IRF7 activated by TBK1 was degraded by VP56 through K48-linked ubiquitination.

Cells infected with most cell-adapted PEDVs usually displayed large syncytia, a process triggered by the spike protein (S). To identify amino acids responsible for S-mediated syncytium formation, we constructed and characterized chimeric S proteins of the cell-adapted variant, YN144, in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1/S2 cleavage site were replaced with those of a poorly culturable field isolate (G2). We demonstrated that the RBD, not the S1/S2 cleavage site, is critical for syncytium formation mediated by chimeric S proteins. Further mutational analyses revealed that a single mutation at the amino acid residue position 672 (V672F) could enable the chimeric S with the entire RBD derived from the G2 strain to trigger large syncytia. Moreover, recombinant PEDV viruses bearing S of the G2 strain with the single V672F substitution could induce extensive syncytium formation and replicate efficiently in VeroE6 cells stably expressing porcine aminopeptidase N (VeroE6-APN). Interestingly, we also demonstrated that while the V672F mutation is critical for the syncytium formation in VeroE6-APN cells, it exerts a minimal effect in Huh-7 cells, thereby suggesting the difference in receptor preference of PEDV among host cells.","publish_time":"2019-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wanitchang, Asawin; Saenboonrueng, Janya; Kaewborisuth, Challika; Srisutthisamphan, Kanjana; Jongkaewwattana, Anan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f06986bac5a2e4aaba548056be566362badcde9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466060.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-mediated syncytium formation","VeroE6 cells","chimeric S proteins","VeroE6-APN cells","extensive syncytium formation","host cells","V672F mutation","G2 strain","cell-adapted variant","cell-adapted PEDVs","single V672F substitution","single mutation","S1","receptor preference of PEDV","entire RBD","S2 cleavage site","large syncytia","recombinant PEDV viruses","established cell lines","porcine aminopeptidase N","amino acids responsible","receptor binding domain","amino acid residue position","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","high efficiency","villi of neonatal piglets","isolated variants","replicates","enterocytes","YN144","process","difference","minimal effect","culturable field isolate","mutational analyses","spike protein","multiple passages"],"language":"en"},

The Southeast Asian region is particularly prone to public health threats such as emerging infectious diseases and faces future health challenges including those of noncommunicable diseases. This study looks at the potential of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a regional organization to lead a regional dynamic for health cooperation in order to overcome these challenges. Through a comparative study with the regional mechanisms of the European Union (EU) for health cooperation, we look at how ASEAN could maximize its potential as a global health actor. Our study is based on primary research and semistructured field interviews. To illustrate our arguments, we refer to the extent of regional cooperation for health in ASEAN and the EU for (re)emerging infectious disease control and for tobacco control. We argue that regional institutions and a network of civil society organizations are crucial in relaying global initiatives, and ensuring the effective implementation of global guidelines at the national level.

While seasonal patterns of HPIV types 1\u20133 have been described, less is known about national patterns of HPIV-4 circulation. Objectives To describe patterns of HPIVs circulation in the United States (US). Study design We used data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), a voluntary passive laboratory-based surveillance system, to characterize the epidemiology and circulation patterns of HPIVs in the US during 2011\u20132019. We summarized the number of weekly aggregated HPIV detections nationally and by US census region, and used a subset of data submitted to NREVSS from public health laboratories and several clinical laboratories during 2015\u20132019 to analyze differences in patient demographics. Results During July 2011 - June 2019, 2,700,135 HPIV tests were reported; 122,852 (5 %) were positive for any HPIV including 22,446 for HPIV-1 (18 %), 17,474 for HPIV-2 (14 %), 67,649 for HPIV-3 (55 %), and 15,283 for HPIV-4 (13 %). HPIV testing increased substantially each year. The majority of detections occurred in children aged \u2264 2 years (36 %) with fluctuations in the distribution of age by type. Conclusions HPIVs were detected year-round during 2011\u20132019, with type-specific year-to-year variations in circulation patterns. Among HPIV detections where age was known, the majority were aged \u2264 2 years. HPIV-4 exhibited an annual fall-winter seasonality, both nationally and regionally. Continued surveillance is needed to better understand national patterns of HPIV circulation.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeGroote, Nicholas P.; Haynes, Amber K.; Taylor, Calli; Killerby, Marie E.; Dahl, Rebecca M.; Mustaquim, Desiree; Gerber, Susan I.; Watson, John T.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23250e92c304661d0ead2a9dbef8991ac14ec35e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106518.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31954277/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220300032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220300032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPIV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["HPIV testing","HPIV tests","national patterns of HPIV circulation","seasonal patterns of HPIV types","patterns of HPIVs circulation","circulation patterns of HPIVs","number of weekly aggregated HPIV detections","Conclusions HPIVs","majority of detections","NREVSS","year variations","Continued surveillance","type-specific year","years","Enteric Virus Surveillance System","US census region","voluntary passive laboratory-based surveillance system","clinical laboratories","subset of data","distribution of age","young children","public health laboratories","lower respiratory tract illnesses","cause upper","Abstract Background Human parainfluenza viruses","epidemiology","United States","infants","annual fall-winter seasonality","fluctuations","Objectives","Study design","differences","patient demographics","elderly","Results"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection. We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients. BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection. The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFN\u03B1, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV. The absence of IFN\u03B1, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response. This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFN\u03B3 that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans. Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. We highlight the critical role of IFN\u03B1 in this initial stage to orchestrate a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early IFN\u03B1 treatment during MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2014-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faure, Emmanuel; Poissy, Julien; Goffard, Anne; Fournier, Clement; Kipnis, Eric; Titecat, Marie; Bortolotti, Perinne; Martinez, Laura; Dubucquoi, Sylvain; Dessein, Rodrigue; Gosset, Philippe; Mathieu, Daniel; Guery, Benoit","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc38fa3321df5137294140ffe1a358399befb500.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3925152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551142/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0088716","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","BAL"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","CoV infected patients","early stage of MERS","BAL cells of MERS","robust immune response","case of infection","indication of early IFN\u03B1 treatment","control patients","absence of IFN\u03B1","adaptive immune responses","relevant treatment","critical role of IFN\u03B1","best treatment","BAL supernatants","IL","sera","initial stage","robust antiviral adaptive Th","Host recognition of viral dsRNA","extraction of RNA","poor outcome","viral clearance","double stranded RNA","different clinical approaches","potential therapeutic approaches","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","substantial arguments","development","chemokines secretion","qRTPCR","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Quantitative polymerase chain reaction","levels","cytokines","IFN\u03B3","weeks","intensive care unit","viruses","clear consensus","antigen presentation","underlying mechanisms","Broncho-alveolar lavage","occurrence","type","month","production","findings","World Health Organization","Interferon","humans","mediators","national agencies","year","study"],"language":"en"},

An increasing number of reports reveal that many viruses induce modifications of nuclear substructures including nucleoli, whether they replicate or not in the nucleus of infected cells. Indeed, during infection of cells with various types of human viruses, nucleoli undergo important morphological modifications. A large number of viral components traffic to and from the nucleolus where they interact with different cellular and/or viral factors, numerous host nucleolar proteins are redistributed in other cell compartments or are modified and some cellular proteins are delocalised in the nucleolus of infected cells. Well\u2010documented studies have established that several of these nucleolar modifications play a role in some steps of the viral cycle, and also in fundamental cellular pathways. The nucleolus itself is the place where several essential steps of the viral cycle take place.

The novel coronavirus (nCoV), or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is a particular strain different from any other known hCoV with the possibility of human and also zoonotic transmissions. The aim of the study to assess primary health care (PHC) physicians\u2019 knowledge and adherence regarding Saudi Ministry of Health guidelines regarding MERS-CoV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was followed to include 85 PHC physicians in Abha city. An interview questionnaire has been designed by the researcher that was used to assess knowledge and practices of PHC physicians regarding diagnosis and management of MERS-CoV. It includes personal characteristics, the MERS-CoV knowledge assessment questionnaire, and practices related to adherence toward guidelines regarding MERS-CoV. RESULTS: PHC physicians\u2019 knowledge gaps regarding MERS-CoV included protected exposure (32.9%), highest seasonal incidence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (60%), relation between incidence of MERS-CoV and overcrowding (62.4%), case fatality of MERS-CoV cases (63.5%), and collecting specimens from MERS-CoV patients (64.7%). The knowledge of PHC physicians about MERS-CoV was poor among 5.9%, good among 63.5%, and excellent among 30.6%. Personal protective equipment to be used when seeing suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection were mainly the mask (94.1%), gloves (78.8%), the gown (60%), goggles (31.8%), and the cap (22.4%). All participants stated that the most important standard precaution that should be applied when seeing a case of MERS-CoV infection is hand washing, whereas 97.6% stated that the most important respiratory precaution to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in PHC setting when seeing a case of MERS-CoV infection is masking and separation of suspected MERS-CoV patients, and 81.2% stated that upon exit from the room of a MERS-CoV patient, the physician should remove and discard personal protective equipment. PHC physicians\u2019 knowledge about MERS-CoV differed significantly according to their nationality (P = 0.038), with non-Saudi physicians expressing higher percent of excellent knowledge than Saudi physicians (40% and 20%, respectively). Those who attended continuing medical education (CME) activities had significantly higher percent of excellent knowledge than those who did not attend a CME activity (55.6% and 23.9%, respectively, P = 0.011). PHC physicians\u2019 knowledge did not differ significantly according to their age, gender, qualification, experience in PHC, and practice-related adherence to guidelines. PHC physicians\u2019 practice-related adherence to guidelines about MERS-CoV differed significantly according to their position (P = 0.035), with specialists having the highest percent of excellent practice (13%). CONCLUSIONS: There are knowledge gaps among PHC physicians in Abha city, and their practice is suboptimal regarding MERS-CoV infection.

With no proven vaccination or treatment, infection control measures are paramount. In this article, we aim to describe the impact of COVID-19 on our practice and share our strategies and guidelines to maintain a sustainable ophthalmology practice. METHODS: Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Eye Centre is the only ophthalmology department supporting the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), which is the national screening center and the main center for management of COVID-19 patients in Singapore. Our guidelines during this outbreak are discussed. RESULTS: Challenges in different care settings in our ophthalmology practice have been identified and analyzed with practical solutions and guidelines implemented in anticipation of these challenges. First, to minimize cross-infection of COVID-19, stringent infection control measures were set up. These include personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers and routine cleaning of \u201Chigh-touch\u201D surfaces. Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients. Administrative measures to lower patient attendance and reschedule appointments were carried out. Third, inpatient and outpatient care were separated to minimize interactions. Last but not least, logistics and manpower plans were drawn up in anticipation of resource demands and measures to improve the mental well-being of staff were implemented. CONCLUSION: We hope our measures during this COVID-19 pandemic can help ophthalmologists globally and serve to guide and maintain safe access in ophthalmology clinics when faced with similar disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Louis W.; Yip, Leonard W.; Tay, Hui Wen; Ang, Xue Ling; Lee, Llewellyn K.; Chin, Chee Fang; Yong, Vernon","journal":"Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09c8917c3a94284fff227cc7a5ea4aefece810fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170732.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314034/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-020-04682-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["National Centre for Infectious Diseases"],"keyphrases":["stringent infection control measures","Administrative measures","management of COVID","guidelines","impact of COVID","sustainable ophthalmology practice","ophthalmology clinics","ophthalmology department","outpatient care","National Centre","national screening center","cross-infection","high-risk patients","Challenges","stringent dual screening","different care settings","Eye Centre","main center","anticipation of resource demands","Tan Tock Seng Hospital","PPE","healthcare workers","TTSH","treatment","routine cleaning","lower patient attendance","NCID","high-touch","Infectious Diseases","triaging process","proven vaccination","personal protective equipment","METHODS","RESULTS","proper isolation","similar disease outbreaks","global health threat","appointments","manpower plans","mental well-being of staff","safe access","practical solutions","Coronavirus","strategies","pandemic","logistics","surfaces","PURPOSE","ophthalmologists","interactions","Singapore","CONCLUSION","article"],"language":"en"},

Here we report a newly detected strain of CHIK, Zhejiang/chik-sy/2012, in China, a nonindigenous region for CHIK, using a modified approach based on the classic cDNA-AFLP. We then performed etiological and phylogenetic analyses to better understand its molecular characterization and phylogenetic pattern, and also to aid in further evaluating its persistence in Southeast Asia. METHODS: By using this modified procedure, we determined for the first time the complete genome sequence of the chikungunya virus strain, Zhejiang/chik-sy/2012, isolated in 2012 from a patient in Zhejiang, China. Sequence analyses revealed that this positive single strand of RNA is 12,017 bp long. We found no single amino acid mutation in A226V, D284E and A316V. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our strain shared the greatest homology with a strain isolated in Taiwan, which was derived from a strain from Indonesia. Chik-sy/2012 is in a different clade from other CHIK viruses found in China previously. CONCLUSIONS: A modified cDNA-AFLP in virus discovery was used to isolate the first CHIK and the first complete genome sequence of virus strain chik-sy/2012 in 2012 from a patient with CHIK fever in Zhejiang, China. The infection displayed great phylogenetic distance from viruses detected in Guangdong, China, in 2008 and 2010, since they were derived from another evolutionary lineage. Additional molecular epidemiology data are needed to further understand, monitor and evaluate CHIK in China.","publish_time":"2013-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yi; Yan, JuYing; Mao, HaiYan; Zhang, Lei; Lyu, QinFeng; Wu, ZhongHua; Zheng, Wei; Feng, Cen; Zhang, YanJun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5159ab148faaafed700258c0a6278cb1fb5476e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3867435.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24367579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIK"],"locations":["China","Southeast Asia","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["CHIK viruses","detected strain of CHIK","CHIK fever","China","complete genome sequence of virus strain chik-sy","chikungunya virus strain","Zhejiang","phylogenetic analyses","virus discovery","Sequence analyses","phylogenetic pattern","Phylogenetic analysis","modified cDNA-AFLP","great phylogenetic distance","modified approach","modified procedure","patient","classic cDNA-AFLP","molecular characterization","great health challenges","single amino acid mutation","positive single strand of RNA","Additional molecular epidemiology data","A226V","emerging pathogen","D284E","bp","mosquito","infection","Guangdong","greatest homology","different clade","nonindigenous region","A316V","CONCLUSIONS","time","BACKGROUND","tropical zones","persistence","Southeast Asia","METHODS","Taiwan","evolutionary lineage","Indonesia"],"language":"en"},

To this end, Renilla luciferase-encoding SARS-CoV replicons with selectively deleted macrodomains were constructed and their ability to modulate the RTC activity was examined. While the SUD-N and the X domains were found to be dispensable, the SUD-M domain was crucial for viral genome replication/transcription.

Horses with fungal elements observed on the TW cytology had 2 times greater chance of having IAD than horses without fungi (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% CI 1.08\u20103.33; P = .0003). Risks of being diagnosed with IAD and likelihood of fungi in TW were higher when horses were bedded on straw (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.2\u20103.2 and OR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.3\u20102.6, respectively) or fed dry hay (OR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.7\u20104.4 and OR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.6\u20103.4, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Horses inhaling aerosolized fungal particles are at a significantly higher risk of developing IAD. The type of bedding and forage represent significant risk factors for IAD and fungal contamination of equine airways.","publish_time":"2018-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dauvillier, Julie; ter Woort, Fe; van Erck\u2010Westergren, Emmanuelle","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c4c3663078fac75ec89955444e1bed1f069e751.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6430897.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAD","TW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active horses","presence of fungi","respiratory samples of horses","prevalence of fungi","role of fungi","likelihood of fungi","higher risk of developing IAD","TW cytology","fungal elements","positive fungal culture","clinical signs","signs of respiratory disease","aerosolized fungal particles","fungal contamination of equine airways","significant risk factors","inflammatory airway disease","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","clinical data","bacterial culture","results","recurrent airway obstruction","inflammatory response of lungs","specialized ambulatory practice","forage","times greater chance","tracheal wash","environmental conditions","forms of asthma","prospective observational study","type of bedding","bronchoalveolar lavage","poor performance","odds ratio","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","humans","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","straw","dry hay","ANIMALS","Risks"],"language":"en"},

This study examined the sources of confusion during the MERS outbreak and identified the factors that can affect people\u0027s behavior. Methods An online survey of the risk perception of university students in South Korea was performed after the epidemic had peaked. The questionnaire addressed the major social determinants in South Korea during the MERS epidemic. The analysis included data from 1,470 subjects who provided complete answers. Results The students had 53.5% of the essential knowledge about MERS. Women showed higher risk perception than men, and trust in the media was positively associated with risk perception (P \u003C .001). Additionally, risk perception was positively associated with overreaction by the public (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.60; P \u003C .001). These findings suggest that media content affected the public\u0027s perception of MERS risk and that perception of a high level of risk led to overreaction. Conclusions Risk perception was associated with most of the social factors examined and overreaction by the public. Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public, establishing trust, and facilitating the development of an attitude will all be important in future crises.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Seongwoo; Cho, Sung-Il","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3ccc891fe98d9eab49ba3768f114356631c6a7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115287.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28385465/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655317301347; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655317301347; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2017.02.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["public\u0027s perception of MERS risk","higher risk perception","Conclusions Risk perception","risk perception of university students","MERS outbreak","MERS epidemic","South Korea","high level of risk","overreaction","public health","data","social factors","trust","major social determinants","media content","inappropriate responses of major institutions","serious threat","Middle East respiratory syndrome","online survey","subjects","sources of confusion","Women","odds ratio","attitude","questionnaire","Methods","accurate information","future crises","complete answers","essential knowledge","study","confidence interval","people\u0027s behavior","development","analysis","findings"],"language":"en"},

Conclusions In COPD, airway and systemic inflammatory markers increase over time; high levels of these markers are associated with a faster decline in lung function.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donaldson, Gavin C.; Seemungal, Terence A.R.; Patel, Irem S.; Bhowmik, Angshu; Wilkinson, Tom M.A.; Hurst, John R.; MacCallum, Peter K.; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38957a1c0f8c6c89ad5bfb7a451fda9d357d5371.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172405.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215525956; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215525956","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["yr","faster FEV1","COPD patients","faster decline","Pred decline","IQR","sputum IL","Study objectives Patients","time","faster rise","accelerated decline","sputum neutrophil count","plasma fibrinogen","gram sputum","sputum interleukin","median age","group median","systemic inflammatory markers","systemic inflammation","years","high neutrophil count","infrequent exacerbations","pg","COPD experience lower airway","inflammation changes","high levels","nonexacerbation","cells","interquartile range","recruitment","Conclusions","lung function","cohort","percentage","evidence","Results"],"language":"en"},

We previously observed that membrane potential depolarization enhances the release of HIV-1 viruses. Because membrane polarization affects the biomembrane directly, here we examined the effects of KCNK3/9/15 on the budding of nonviral vesicles. We found that depolarization by knocking down endogenous KCNK3/9/15 promoted secretion of cell-derived vesicles. We further used Vpu (an antagonist of KCNK3) as a model for the in vivo study of depolarization-stimulated secretion. Vpu is a HIV-1-encoded, ion channel-like protein (viroporin) capable of enhancing virus release and depolarizing the cell membrane potential. We found that Vpu could also promote nonviral vesicle release, perhaps through a similar mechanism that Vpu utilizes to promote viral particle release. Notably, T cells expressing Vpu alone became pathologically low in intracellular K(\u002B) and insensitive to extracellular K(\u002B) or membrane potential stimulation. In contrast, heterologous expression of KCNK3 in T cells stabilized the cell potentials by maintaining intracellular K(\u002B). We thus concluded that KCNK3/9/15 expression limits membrane depolarization and depolarization-induced secretion at least in part by maintaining intracellular K(\u002B).","publish_time":"2011-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Daniel Tsung-Ning; Chi, Naiwen; Chen, Shiou-Ching; Lee, Ting-Ying; Hsu, Kate","journal":"Cell Biochem Biophys","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09076c8327aa32cdaf9ec5e45354d66bc35d1523.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090673.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12013-011-9241-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21761257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane potential depolarization","Vpu","cell membrane potential","membrane potential stimulation","expression limits membrane depolarization","endogenous KCNK3","antagonist of KCNK3","channels KCNK3","effects of KCNK3","membrane polarization","depolarization-induced secretion","study of depolarization","release of HIV","heterologous expression of KCNK3","promoted secretion of cell","virus release","cell potentials","nonviral vesicle release","viral particle release","stimulated secretion","T cells","budding of nonviral vesicles","derived vesicles","viroporin","pore potassium","protein","similar mechanism","model","main function of background","ion channel","contrast","biomembrane","viruses"],"language":"en"},

ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Contradictory data have been reported on the incidence of stroke in patients with COVID-19 and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with history of stroke. METHODS: This study systematically reviews case series reporting stroke as a complication of COVID-19, and analyses the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and history of stroke. The pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in patients with COVID-19 are also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: History of stroke increases the risk of death due to COVID-19 by 3 times. Stroke currently seems not to be one of the main complications of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gabriel y Gal\u00E1n, Jose Mar\u00EDa Trejo","journal":"Neurologia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53a8725be2d042deae45c3c9f1929f3b333c815c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S021348532030092X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S021348532030092X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Stroke"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enfermos de COVID","the prognosis of patients with COVID","and history of stroke","be one of the main complications of COVID","The pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in patients with COVID","series reporting stroke as a complication of COVID","antecedentes de ictus","and the risk of SARS","infection among patients with history of stroke","the risk of death due","have been reported on the incidence of stroke in patients with COVID","incidencia de ictus","Stroke currently seems not","riesgo","series de casos","This study systematically reviews","Contradictory","bibliograf\u00EDa","ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION","informaci\u00F3n contradictoria","METHODS","pron\u00F3stico","veces","CONCLUSIONS","Revisi\u00F3n sistem\u00E1tica","also reviewed","M\u00C9TODOS","RESUMEN INTRODUCCI\u00D3N","by","complicaciones principales","complicaci\u00F3n","pandemia","CONCLUSIONES","enfermedad","momento","mecanismos"],"language":"es"},

Our objective was to determine if a family\u0027s preferred language of Spanish versus English was associated with differences in management of bronchiolitis in the PED. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of children \u22642 years old diagnosed with bronchiolitis in a PED over a 7-year period. Rates of PED testing, interventions, and disposition among children whose families\u2019 preferred language was Spanish were compared to children whose families\u2019 preferred language was English. Primary outcomes were frequencies of chest x-ray and bronchodilator orders. Secondary outcomes were diagnostic testing, medication orders, and disposition. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios after controlling for age, emergency severity index, prior visit, and nesting within attending physicians. RESULTS: A total of 13,612 encounters were included. Spanish-speaking families were more likely to have chest x-rays (35.8% vs 26.7%, P \u003C .0001; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2\u20131.9), complete blood counts (8.2% vs 4.9%, P \u003C .005; aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2\u20132.5), and blood cultures ordered (8.1% vs 5.0%, P \u003C .05; aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2\u20132.4). No other differences in bronchodilators, medication orders, or disposition were found between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among children diagnosed with bronchiolitis, Spanish-speaking families were more likely to have chest x-rays, complete blood counts, and blood cultures ordered compared to English-speaking families. Further research on how clinical practice guidelines and equity-focused guidelines can impact disparities in diagnostic testing within the PED is warranted.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamor, Ronine; Byczkowski, Terri; Zhang, Yin; Vaughn, Lisa; Mahabee-Gittens, E.

We reported previously the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver and kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in sera from mice infected with MHV-A59. Long-term MHV-infected mice represented a good model of non-pathogenic autoimmune response since the animals were apparently healthy in spite of the presence of autoAb. The aim of this work was to see whether a severe liver injury, which releases endogenous adjuvants, i.e. danger signals, could elicit a broader spectrum of autoAb and perhaps signs of autoimmune hepatitis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) was injected into mice 30 days after MHV infection, and serum was assayed for autoAb and total IgG 20 days later. The association of MHV infection with the toxic effects of CCl(4) resulted in hypergammaglobulinaemia and the production of autoAb to various liver and kidney proteins. Histological examination of liver samples showed tissue damages but without significant differences between the animals submitted to MHV \u002B CCl(4) and controls, which were either infected by MHV without CCl(4), or poisoned by CCl(4) in the absence of MHV infection. Those results show that liver injury after viral infection may lead to the spreading of the immune response and to an increase of serum IgG, suggesting that the procedure used herein could simulate the onset of autoimmune hepatitis.","publish_time":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aparicio, Jos\u00E9 L.; Duhalde-Vega, Maite; Loureiro, Mar\u00EDa E.; Retegui, Lilia A.","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106016.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19258054/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576909000666; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2009.02.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576909000666","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-A59","association of MHV infection","absence of MHV infection","Long-term MHV-infected mice","various liver","presence of autoAb","production of autoAb","severe liver injury","signs of autoimmune hepatitis","onset of autoimmune hepatitis","viral infection","broader spectrum of autoAb","toxic effects of CCl","Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","Histological examination of liver samples","animals","hypergammaglobulinaemia","days","increase of serum IgG","good model of non-pathogenic autoimmune response","mouse strains","kidney proteins","total IgG","presence of autoantibodies","triggers various pathologies","kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase","tissue damages","FAH","endogenous adjuvants","significant differences","sera","danger signals","spreading","spite","procedure","thymus involution","results","work","Carbon tetrachloride","aim","controls"],"language":"en"},

However, the ability of this approach to confidently reconstruct transmission trees is limited by the knowledge of the genetic diversity of viruses that exist within different epidemiological units. In order to address this question, this study investigated the variability of 45 foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome sequences (from 33 animals) that were collected during 2007 from eight premises (10 different herds) in the United Kingdom. Bayesian and statistical parsimony analysis demonstrated that these sequences exhibited clustering which was consistent with a transmission scenario describing herd-to-herd spread of the virus. As an alternative to analysing all of the available samples in future epidemics, the impact of randomly selecting one sequence from each of these herds was used to assess cost-effective methods that might be used to infer transmission trees during FMD outbreaks. Using these approaches, 85% and 91% of the resulting topologies were either identical or differed by only one edge from a reference tree comprising all of the sequences generated within the outbreak. The sequence distances that accrued during sequential transmission events between epidemiological units was estimated to be 4.6 nucleotides, although the genetic variability between viruses recovered from chronic carrier animals was higher than between viruses from animals with acute-stage infection: an observation which poses challenges for the use of simple approaches to infer transmission trees. This study helps to develop strategies for sampling during FMD outbreaks, and provides data that will guide the development of further models to support control policies in the event of virus incursions into FMD free countries.","publish_time":"2015-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valdazo-Gonz\u00E1lez, Bego\u00F1a; Kim, Jan T.; Soubeyrand, Samuel; Wadsworth, Jemma; Knowles, Nick J.; Haydon, Daniel T.; King, Donald P.","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b3dc04ff123b8aa8bca8f0caa665376bd16f6f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25861750/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134815001173; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134815001173","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission trees","transmission scenario","genome sequences","RNA viruses","FMD outbreaks","sequential transmission events","genetic diversity of viruses","different epidemiological units","different herds","genetic variability","study","event of virus incursions","mouth disease virus","chronic carrier animals","FMD free countries","future epidemics","sequence distances","use of simple approaches","fine-scale dynamics of epidemics","observation","challenges","control policies","acute-stage infection","foot","FMDV","knowledge","statistical parsimony analysis","available samples","impact","strategies","sampling","clustering","development","models","Bayesian","reference tree","question","United Kingdom","data","nucleotides","resulting topologies","cost-effective methods","premises","order","alternative"],"language":"en"},

However, most of them require researchers to remain online and wait for returned results. The latter not only requires highly available network connection, but also may cause the network overload. Moreover, so far none of the existing approaches has been designed to address the following problems when retrieving the remote data in a mobile network environment: (1) the resources of mobile devices are limited; (2) network connection is relatively of low quality; and (3) mobile users are not always online. To address the aforementioned problems, we integrate an agent migration approach with a multi-agent system to overcome the high latency or limited bandwidth problem by moving their computations to the required resources or services. More importantly, the approach is fit for the mobile computing environments. Presented in this paper are also the system architecture, the migration strategy, as well as the security authentication of agent migration. As a demonstration, the remote data retrieval from GenBank was used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.","publish_time":"2011-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Lei; Dai, Hua; Zhang, Tong-Liang; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb76568fb12e6a9802c85a994def23156d29352b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3119054.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701677/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020949","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["agent migration approach","mobile network environment","remote data retrieval","mobile users","network overload","resources of mobile devices","available network connection","multi-agent system","multiple remote biological data sources","security authentication of agent migration","migration strategy","proposed approach","mobile computing environments","system architecture","required resources","following problems","aforementioned problems","existing approaches","limited bandwidth problem","high latency","computations","GenBank","low quality","services","feasibility","demonstration","paper","researchers","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the genetic diversity of the RSV strains was investigated among nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) taken from children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with ALRTIs in Hospital Serdang, Malaysia. A total of 165 NPA samples were tested for the presence of RSV and other respiratory viruses from June until December 2009. RSV was found positive in 83 (50%) of the samples using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further classification of 67 RSV strains showed that subgroups A and B comprised 11/67 (16.4%) and 56/67 (83.6%) of the strains, respectively. The second hypervariable region at the carboxyl-terminal of the G gene was amplified and sequenced in order to do phylogenetic study. The phylogenetic relationships of the samples were determined separately for subgroups A and B using neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian inference (BI). Phylogenetic analysis of the 32 sequenced samples showed that all 9 RSV-A strains were clustered within NA1 genotype while the remaining 23 strains of the RSV-B subgroup could be grouped into a clade consisted of strains with 60-nucleotide duplication region. They were further classified into newly discovered BA10 and BA9 genotypes. The present finding suggests the emergence of RSV genotypes of NA1 and BA. This is the first documentation of the phylogenetic relationship and genetic diversity of RSV strains among hospitalized children diagnosed with ALRTI in Serdang, Malaysia.","publish_time":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Etemadi, Mohammad Reza; Sekawi, Zamberi; Othman, Norlijah; Lye, Munn-Sann; Moghaddam, Faezeh Yazdani","journal":"Evol Bioinform Online","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43135847895cbae1138318075bbe819dcea3259d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3629939.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4137/ebo.s10999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23641140/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","NPA"],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["genetic diversity of RSV strains","presence of RSV","RSV-B subgroup","emergence of RSV genotypes of NA1","hospitalized children","NPA samples","sequenced samples","phylogenetic study","Phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic relationships","ALRTIs","respiratory viruses","subgroups","Malaysia","Human respiratory syncytial virus","Hospital Serdang","NA1 genotype","BA9 genotypes","hypervariable region","acute lower respiratory tract infections","nucleotide duplication region","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","major viral pathogen","RT-PCR","carboxyl-terminal","NJ","nasopharyngeal aspirates","maximum parsimony","neighbor","years of age","Bayesian inference","G gene","present finding","discovered BA10","order","documentation","BI","clade","total","classification"],"language":"en"},

Each ReTi-PCR test was validated for specificity, analytical sensitivity (detection limits), and experimental infection studies were performed to compare the conventional virus isolation methods with the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests. All five developed ReTi-PCR tests are very rapid compared to virus isolation, highly specific, and even more sensitive (lower detection limits) than conventional virus isolation methods for the detection of mentioned viruses in semen. In semen of experimentally infected boars, viruses were detected much earlier after infection and more frequently by ReTi-PCR tests than by virus isolations. The high throughput of these rapid ReTi-PCR tests makes it possible to screen large number of semen samples for the presence of viruses prior to insemination. This is a substantial advantage, in particular for boar semen the quality of which deteriorates quickly after storage. In general, the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests are valuable tools for the early, reliable and rapid detection of five economically important viruses, namely PRV, CSFV, FMDV, SVDV, and PRRSV in boar semen.

Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken every 3 to 4 days and screened for RSV using a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The amount of virus shed was quantified by calculating the \u2018area under the curve\u2019 using the trapezoidal rule applied to rescaled PCR cycle threshold output.

Results: The median quantity of virus shed per infection episode was 29.4 (95% CI: 15.2, 54.2) log (10 )ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies * days. Young age (\u003C1 year), presence of upper respiratory symptoms, intra-household acquisition of infection, an individual\u2019s first infection episode in the RSV season, and having a co-infection of RSV group A and B were associated with increased amount of virus shed.

Current vaccination campaigns have limitations especially in developing countries, due to elevated costs, need of trained personnel for effective vaccine administration, and functional cold chain network to maintain vaccine viability. These problems have led to heightened interest in producing new antiviral strategies, such as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi methodology is capable of substantially decreasing viral replication at a cellular level, both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we utilize microRNA (miRNA)-expressing constructs (a type of RNA interference) in an attempt to target and knockdown five NDV structural RNAs for nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large (L) protein genes. Immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1) that transiently expressed miRNA targeting NP mRNA, showed increased resistance to NDV-induced cytopathic effects, as determined by cell count, relative to the same cells expressing miRNA against alternative NDV proteins. Upon infection with NDV, DF-1 cells constitutively expressing the NP miRNA construct had improved cell survival up to 48 h post infection (h.p.i) and decreased viral yield up to 24 h.p.i. These results suggest that overexpression of the NP miRNA in cells and perhaps live animal may provide resistance to NDV.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hutcheson, Jessica M.; Susta, Leonardo; Stice, Steven L.; Afonso, Claudio L.; West, Franklin D.","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a95be86730e25b0e1e036266e082a7f07544a1a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26050911/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105615000275; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2015.03.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105615000275","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","NP","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NP miRNA construct","NDV structural RNAs","alternative NDV proteins","NP mRNA","DF","h post infection","type of RNA interference","Immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cells","vaccine viability","cell count","increased resistance","viral replication","viral yield","RNAi methodology","effective vaccine administration","improved cell survival","functional cold chain network","trained personnel","nucleoprotein","developing countries","live animal","limitations","elevated costs","Newcastle disease virus","constructs","cytopathic effects","new antiviral strategies","Current vaccination campaigns","year millions of chickens","phosphoprotein","attempt","overexpression","fusion","food losses","cellular level","matrix","results","microRNA","protein genes","study","problems"],"language":"en"},

The most common cause of COPD is smoking. There is evidence suggesting that genetic factors influence COPD susceptibility and variants in several candidate genes have been significantly associated with COPD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association of the TNF-\u03B1 \u2013308, SPB\u002B1580, IL-13 \u20131055 gene polymorphisms and latent adenovirus C infection with COPD in an Egyptian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study included 115 subjects (75 smokers with COPD, 25 resistant smokers and 15 non-smokers) who were subjected to spirometric measurements, identification of adenovirus C and genotyping of TNF-\u03B1 \u2013308G/A, SP-B\u002B1580 C/T and IL-13 \u20131055 C/T polymorphisms by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The adenovirus C gene was identified in all subjects. The distribution of TNF-\u03B1 genotypes showed no significant differences between different groups. However, homozygous A genotype was associated with a significant decrease in FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC and FEF25/75% of predicted in COPD (p \u003C 0.05). As regards SP-B genotypes, resistant smokers had a significantly higher homozygous T genotype frequency compared to COPD and non smokers (p = 0.005). Interleukin 13 genotypes showed no significant difference between different groups. There was a significant decrease in FEF25/75% of predicted in T allele carriers in COPD patients (p = 0.001).

The human defence may include antibodies which interact with SARS-CoV-2 and neutralize its aggressive actions on multiple organ systems. Protective cross-reactivity of antibodies against measles and other known viral infections has been postulated, primarily as a result of the initial observations of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 in children. Uncontrolled case series have demonstrated virus-neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma, supporting its efficiency at early stages of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Given the variability of the virus structure, the utility of convalescent plasma is limited to the geographic area of its preparation, and for a short period of time. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also be protective in view of its nonspecific antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Finally, human monoclonal antibodies may interact with some SARS-CoV-2 proteins, inhibiting the virus-receptor interaction and prevent tissue injury. The improved understanding of the host antiviral responses may help develop safe and effective immunotherapeutic strategies against COVID-19 in the foreseeable future.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Yessirkepov, Marlen; Zimba, Olena","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f456defe1fba32fbe2c2671570a3ec00c83d460.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211516.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32383371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early stages of contracting SARS-CoV","mild COVID","virus structure","human monoclonal antibodies","host antiviral responses","virus-receptor interaction","effect of convalescent plasma","utility of convalescent plasma","immune responses","nonspecific antiviral","coronavirus disease","severe course","human defence","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Protective cross-reactivity","effective immunotherapeutic strategies","measles","efficiency","initial observations of asymptomatic","view","aggressive actions","preparation","multiple organ systems","improved understanding","proteins","known viral infections","tissue injury","immunomodulatory effects","geographic area","global fight","Uncontrolled case series","result","short period of time","Intravenous immunoglobulin","complications","foreseeable future","children","variability"],"language":"en"},

Rhinovirus (RV), the common cold virus, is clearly the most prevalent pathogen constantly circulating in the community. This virus also stands out from other viral factors due to its large diversity (about 170 genotypes), very effective replication, a tendency to create Th2-biased inflammatory environment and association with specific risk genes in people predisposed to asthma development (CDHR3). Decreased interferon responses, disrupted airway epithelial barrier, environmental exposures (including biased airway microbiome), and nutritional deficiencies (low in vitamin D and fish oil) increase risk to RV and other virus infections. It is intensively debated whether viral illnesses actually cause asthma. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of bronchiolitis, whereas RV starts to dominate after 1 year of age. Breathing difficulty induced by either of these viruses is associated with later asthma, but the risk is higher for those who suffer from severe RV-induced wheezing. The asthma development associated with these viruses has unique mechanisms, but in general, RV is a risk factor for later atopic asthma, whereas RSV is more likely associated with later non-atopic asthma. Treatments that inhibit inflammation (corticosteroids, omalizumab) effectively decrease RV-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. The anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, decreases the risk of severe RSV illness and subsequent recurrent wheeze. A better understanding of personal and environmental risk factors and inflammatory mechanisms leading to asthma is crucial in developing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of asthma.","publish_time":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jartti, Tuomas; B\u00F8nnelykke, Klaus; Elenius, Varpu; Feleszko, Wojciech","journal":"Semin Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccceaba018920f5d478758a878b14e644aff4925.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7066101.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-020-00781-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["later asthma","asthma development","treatment of asthma","non-atopic asthma","important triggers of asthma exacerbations","environmental risk factors","risk of severe RSV illness","severe RV-induced wheezing","virus infections","specific risk genes","viral factors","Respiratory viral infections","Respiratory syncytial virus","inflammatory mechanisms","viruses","common cold virus","viral illnesses","anti-RSV monoclonal antibody","biased airway microbiome","environmental exposures","Th2-biased inflammatory environment","unique mechanisms","disrupted airway epithelial barrier","leading causative agent of bronchiolitis","association","people","vitamin D","nutritional deficiencies","fish oil","palivizumab","Decreased interferon responses","subsequent recurrent wheeze","tendency","new strategies","better understanding of personal","genotypes","corticosteroids","large diversity","prevention","omalizumab","effective replication","inflammation","CDHR3","prevalent pathogen","community","Treatments","Rhinovirus","year of age","difficulty"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies have focused on the potential antitumor activity of lycorine. In our previous study, we found that lycorine decrease the cell viability of leukemia HL-60 cells and multiple myeloma KM3 cells and induces cell apoptosis. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of lycorine on human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells has yet to be determined. METHODS: Human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells K562 were treated with lycorine. Cell viability was monitored using the method of CCK-8. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity was detected by HDAC colorimetric assay, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cell-cycle related proteins were identified using Western blot. RESULTS: In the present study, we further revealed that lycorine can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells. Analysis of HDAC activity showed that lycroine decreases HDAC enzymatic activities in K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of HDAC activity has been associated with cell-cycle arrest and growth inhibition. We evaluated the cell cycle distribution after lycorine treatment and found that lycorine causes cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. To investigate the mechanism behind this cell cycle arrest, G1-related proteins were assayed by Western blot. After lycorine treatment, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expressions were inhibited and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation was reduced. Lycorine treatment also significantly upregulated the expression of p53 and its target gene product, p21. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity is responsible for at least part of the induction of cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by lycorine and provide a mechanistic framework for further exploring the use of lycorine as a novel antitumor agent.","publish_time":"2012-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Lv; Dai, Hong-Juan; Ye, Mao; Wang, Shu-Ling; Xiao, Xiao-Juan; Zheng, Jie; Chen, Hui-Yong; Luo, Yu-hao; Liu, Jing","journal":"Cancer Cell Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e5c57371f4f2cf8e3d56871a391c25ee43aaa4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3537594.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2867-12-49; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23176676/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lycorine"],"organizations":["HDAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lycorine treatment","cell-cycle arrest","cell cycle arrest","use of lycorine","cell cycle distribution","expression of cell","cell apoptosis","induction of cell","cell viability of leukemia","molecular mechanism of lycorine","potential antitumor activity of lycorine","Inhibition of HDAC activity","Analysis of HDAC activity","cycle related proteins","enzymatic activity","proliferation of K562 cells","Human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells K562","HDAC enzymatic activities","HDAC colorimetric assay","G1 phase","G1-related proteins","multiple myeloma KM3 cells","G0","growth inhibition","Western blot","RESULTS","cyclin-dependent kinase","cyclin D1","expression of p53","present study","previous study","dose-dependent manner","novel antitumor agent","lycroine","expressions","Amaryllidaceae","METHODS","target gene product","natural alkaloid","histone deacetylase","mechanistic framework","retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation","various pharmacological effects","p21","BACKGROUND","flow cytometry","Recent studies","method of CCK","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Pol3 is translated as a Gag3\u2010Pol3 fusion protein dependent on a \u002B1 programmed frameshift at a site with the overlap between the two genes. We show that the Ty3 frameshift frequency varies up to 10\u2010fold in S. cerevisiae cells depending on carbon source. Frameshift efficiency is significantly lower in cells growing on glucose as carbon source than in cells growing on poor alternative carbon sources (glycerol/lactate or galactose). Our results indicate that Ty3 programmed ribosomal frameshift efficiency in response to glucose signalling requires two protein kinases: Snf1p and cAMP\u2010dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Increased frameshifting on alternative carbon sources also appears to require cytoplasmic localization of Snf1p, mediated by the Sip2p protein. In addition to the two required protein kinases, our results implicate that Stm1p, a ribosome\u2010associated protein involved in nutrient sensing, is essential for the carbon source\u2010dependent regulation of Ty3 frameshifting. These data indicate that Ty3 programmed ribosomal frameshift is not a constitutive process but that it is regulated in response to the glucose\u2010signalling pathway.

An ARD outbreak caused by HAdV-7 that involved 739 college students was reported in this article. To better understand the underlying cause of this large-scale epidemic, virus strains were isolated from infected patients and sequence variations of the whole genome sequence were detected. Evolutionary trees and alignment results indicated that the major capsid protein genes hexon and fibre were strongly conserved among serotype 7 strains in China at that time. Instead, the HAdV-7 strains presented three thymine deletions in the virus associated RNA (VA RNA) II terminal region. We also found that the mutation might lead to increased mRNA expression of an adjacent gene, L1 52/55K, and thus promoted faster growth. These findings suggest that sequence variation of VA RNA II gene was a potential cause of such a severe HAdV-7 infection and this gene should be a new-emerging factor to be monitored for better understanding of HAdV-7 infection.","publish_time":"2017-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xiaoxia; Wang, Qiongshu; Liang, Beibei; Wu, Fuli; Li, Hao; Liu, Hongbo; Sheng, Chunyu; Ma, Qiuxia; Yang, Chaojie; Xie, Jing; Li, Peng; Jia, Leili; Wang, Ligui; Du, Xinying; Qiu, Shaofu; Song, Hongbin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c53d3d043454289602f4177bb5125ef3d9d0df38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5321423.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARD","VA RNA II"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["virus strains","severe HAdV","better understanding of HAdV","virus associated RNA","sequence variation of VA RNA","potential cause","adjacent gene","sequence variations","underlying cause","genome sequence","infection","major cause of acute respiratory disease","ARD outbreak","major capsid protein genes hexon","fibre","alignment results","increased mRNA expression","thymine deletions","adults","large-scale epidemic","infected patients","children","new-emerging factor","terminal region","Evolutionary trees","mutation","L1","China","serotype","findings","fatal pneumonia","college students","article","time","Human adenovirus","faster growth"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the epidemiological and genetic variation of HCoV in Guangzhou, south China, we collected totally 13048 throat and nasal swab specimens from adults and children with fever and acute upper respiratory infection symptoms in Gunazhou, south China between July 2010 and June 2015, and the epidemiological features of HCoV and its species were studied. Specimens were screened for HCoV by real-time RT-PCR, and 7 other common respiratory viruses were tested simultaneously by PCR or real-time PCR. HCoV was detected in 294 cases (2.25%) of the 13048 samples, with most of them inpatients (251 cases, 85.4% of HCoV positive cases) and young children not in nursery (53.06%, 156 out of 294 HCoV positive cases). Four HCoVs, as OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 were detected prevalent during 2010\u20132015 in Guangzhou, and among the HCoV positive cases, 60.20% were OC43, 16.67% were 229E, 14.97% were NL63 and 7.82% were HKU1. The month distribution showed that totally HCoV was prevalent in winter, but differences existed in different species. The 5 year distribution of HCoV showed a peak-valley distribution trend, with the detection rate higher in 2011 and 2013 whereas lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The age distribution revealed that children (especially those \u003C3 years old) and old people (\u003E50 years) were both high risk groups to be infected by HCoV. Of the 294 HCoV positive patients, 34.69% (101 cases) were co-infected by other common respiratory viruses, and influenza virus was the most common co-infecting virus (30/101, 29.70%). Fifteen HCoV-OC43 positive samples of 2013\u20132014 were selected for S gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and the results showed that the 15 strains could be divided into 2 clusters in the phylogenetic tree, 12 strains of which formed a separate cluster that was closer to genotype G found in Malaysia.

Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria\u2019s Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 was detected from a powerful owl (Ninox strenua) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to Avian avulavirus 5 was detected from a musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) and a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health.","publish_time":"2018-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amery-Gale, Jemima; Hartley, Carol A.; Vaz, Paola K.; Marenda, Marc S.; Owens, Jane; Eden, Paul A.; Devlin, Joanne M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8780e9524d9271a7b8e789f0f8c4eb6860ca8c50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5865735.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570719/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194457","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Columbid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detected viruses","avian influenza viruses","novel viruses","avian health","viruses of biosecurity","avian patients","avian coronaviruses","avian paramyxovirus","Avian avulavirus","avian hosts","avian virodiversity","low prevalence of viruses","distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses","low level of avian virus detection","Australian birds","human health","screening samples","zoonotic significance","zoonotic potential","wild birds","low risk","veterinary care","Australian Wildlife Health Centre","host specificity","human staff","clinical significance","host-pathogen relationships","Zoos Victoria\u2019s Healesville Sanctuary","sequencing","family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods","Cacatua galerita","Ninox strenua","pathogenicity","inclusion body hepatitis","paramyxoviruses","absence","phylogenetic analyses","tawny frogmouth","genus","sulphur-crested cockatoo","epidemiology","identification","threats","powerful owl","site of exposure","facility","order","musk lorikeet","useful location","Glossopsitta concinna","Podargus strigoides","Hospitals","knowledge","study","Columbid alphaherpesvirus","genome characterization","studies"],"language":"en"},

The concept of phylodynamics has evolved since the early 21(st) century, extending its reach to slower-evolving pathogens, including bacteria and fungi, and to the identification of influential factors in disease spread and pathogen population dynamics. RESULTS: The phylodynamic approach has now become a fundamental building block for the development of comparative phylogenetic tools capable of incorporating epidemiological surveillance data with molecular sequences into a single statistical framework. These innovative tools have greatly enhanced scientific investigations of the temporal and geographical origins, evolutionary history, and ecological risk factors associated with the growth and spread of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika, and dengue and bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Capitalizing on an extensive review of the literature, we discuss the evolution of the field of infectious disease epidemiology and recent accomplishments, highlighting the advancements in phylodynamics, as well as the challenges and limitations currently facing researchers studying emerging pathogen epidemics across the globe.

They infect humans as well as numerous mammalian species. Both viruses use ephrin-B2 and -B3 as cell entry receptors, and following initial entry into an organism, they are capable of rapid spread throughout the host. We have previously reported that Nipah virus can use another attachment receptor, different from its entry receptors, to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host. Here, this attachment molecule was identified as heparan sulfate for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Cells devoid of heparan sulfate were not able to mediate henipavirus trans-infection and showed reduced permissivity to infection. Virus pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins bound heparan sulfate and heparin but no other glycosaminoglycans in a surface plasmon resonance assay. Furthermore, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with the heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin was shown to bind to ephrin-B3 and to restrain infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, treatment with heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. Altogether, these results reveal heparan sulfate as a new attachment receptor for henipaviruses and as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections.","publish_time":"2015-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathieu, Cyrille; Dhondt, K\u00E9vin P.; Ch\u00E2lons, Marie; M\u00E9ly, St\u00E9phane; Raoul, Herv\u00E9; Negre, Didier; Cosset, Fran\u00E7ois-Lo\u00EFc; Gerlier, Denis; Viv\u00E8s, Romain R.; Horvat, Branka","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd969a7721176db21314930b62e62a37e902dae5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4453572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759505/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02427-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hendra virus","Nipah virus glycoproteins","Cells devoid of heparan sulfate","survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters","trans-infection of henipaviruses","henipavirus trans-infection","cell entry receptors","infection of permissive cells","new attachment receptor","initial entry","heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity","attachment molecule","ephrin-B3","host","genus Henipavirus","ephrin-B2","glycosaminoglycans","development of novel approaches","potential therapeutic target","reduced permissivity","surface plasmon resonance assay","organism","nonpermissive","treatment","interaction","capable of rapid spread","zoonotic paramyxoviruses","viral dissemination","humans","numerous mammalian species","leukocytes","lethal infections","results"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: We presented the results obtained using 8 genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals reproducing both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved.

The large coronavirus genome (26\u201331 kb) encodes 15\u201316 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are derived from two replicase polyproteins by autoproteolytic processing. The nsps assemble into the viral replication\u2013transcription complex and nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are believed to anchor this enzyme complex to modified intracellular membranes. The largest part of the coronavirus nsp4 subunit is hydrophobic and is predicted to be embedded in the membranes. In this report, a conserved C-terminal domain (\u223C100 amino-acid residues) has been delineated that is predicted to face the cytoplasm and has been isolated as a soluble domain using library-based construct screening. A prototypical crystal structure at 2.8 \u00C5 resolution was obtained using nsp4 from feline coronavirus. Unmodified and SeMet-substituted proteins were crystallized under similar conditions, resulting in tetragonal crystals that belonged to space group P4(3).

UpToDate is an online clinical decision support resource that is used extensively by clinicians around the world.

We analyzed daily searches related to MERS in Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during 3 outbreaks in these cities in 2014 and 2015 and compared them with reported cases during the same periods. We also compared UpToDate MERS searches in the affected cities to those in a composite of 4 negative control cities for the 2 outbreaks in 2014. Results. UpToDate MERS searches during all 3 MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia showed a correlation to reported cases. In addition, UpToDate MERS search volume in Jeddah and Riyadh during the outbreak periods in 2014 was significantly higher than the concurrent search volume in the 4 negative control cities. In contrast, during the baseline periods, there was no difference between UpToDate searches for MERS in the affected cities compared with the negative control cities. Conclusions. UpToDate search activity seems to be useful for detecting and monitoring outbreaks of MERS in Saudi Arabia.","publish_time":"2016-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thorner, Anna R.; Cao, Bin; Jiang, Terrence; Warner, Amy J.; Bonis, Peter A.","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ee27c1e260d85de463d5db8aa8ab886e1df6180.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4803184.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27011953/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofw043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital"],"locations":["Middle East","Jeddah","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["UpToDate MERS searches","UpToDate searches","monitoring outbreaks of MERS","monitor MERS outbreaks","UpToDate MERS search volume","Saudi Arabia","affected cities","negative control cities","UpToDate search activity","daily searches","monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks","Jeddah","Riyadh","concurrent search volume","outbreak periods","baseline periods","reported cases","Middle East respiratory syndrome","online clinical decision support resource","difference","composite","detection","correlation","addition","Digital surveillance techniques","clinicians","contrast","world","Background","Results","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein and contains a catalytically active ectodomain that can be shed from the cell surface into the extracellular space, via cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM-17). ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml. While MLN-4760 potently inhibits the activity of both human and mouse ACE2, DX600 (linear form) only effectively blocks human ACE2 activity in this assay. In biological samples of human and mouse urine, cell culture medium from mouse proximal tubular cells, and mouse plasma, the mean intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of the assay range from 1.43 to 4.39 %, and from 7.01 to 13.17 %, respectively. We present data on the time and substrate concentration dependence of the assay, and show that exogenous d -glucose, creatinine, urea, and albumin do not interfere with its performance. In biological fluids, this assay is a simple and reliable method to study the role of ACE2 and its shed fragments in cardiovascular and renal diseases.","publish_time":"2017-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Fengxia; Burns, Kevin D.","journal":"Hypertension","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/594b85eae1a25e4ac2f1d23a17d8b6a93c01c92d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121061.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6625-7_8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28116710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse ACE2","human ACE2 activity","role of ACE2","ACE2 detection","measurement of ACE2 activity","ACE2 enzymatic activity","ACE2 inhibitors MLN","mouse plasma","mouse urine","assay range","biological fluids","intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate","biological samples of human","Recombinant human","inter-assay coefficients of variation","mouse proximal tubular cells","cell culture medium","cell surface","DX600","renal diseases","conditioned cell culture media","renin-angiotensin system","reliable method","detailed method","shed fragments","present data","substrate concentration dependence","integral membrane protein","hydrolysis","CVs","absence","linear form","creatinine","time","presence","extracellular space","exogenous d -glucose","disintegrin","cleavage","urea","type","member","standard curves","albumin","metalloproteinase","active ectodomain","ADAM","enzyme","performance"],"language":"en"},

Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (\u03B1-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10\u22124 M to one of 10\u22129 M or lower. These findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of VSV, although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin, can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors.","publish_time":"1984-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukherjee, Pranab K.; Simpson, Robert W.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682284901910; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682284901910","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indomethacin-treated cells","drug indomethacin","infection of cells","replication of VSV","Abstract Indomethacin","indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV","inhibitory effect of indomethacin","Strong inhibition of viral replication","mitomycin C","protein synthesis","cyclooxygenase function","drug level","Pretreatment of HEp","drug removal","inhibitory dose","cultures","messenger RNA synthesis","cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen","metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA","dose response","various classes of metabolic inhibitors","potent nonsteroidal inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase","actinomycin D","yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus","preexisting host factors essential","\u03B1-amanitin","treatment period","increasing times","oxyphenylbutazone","findings","cyclic AMP","concentrations","substances","permissive cell lines","productive infections","phenacetin","cycloheximide","insulin","levels"],"language":"en"},

Although the virus infection is generally associated with mild disease and a relatively low mortality, it is projected that mutations in specific regions of the viral genome, especially within the receptor binding domain of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein could result in more virulent virus stains, leading to a more severe pathogenicity. METHODS: To monitor the genetic polymorphisms at position 222 of Haemagglutinin of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from both outpatients with mild influenza and individuals with severe disease requiring hospitalization, during 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 seasons, a sequence-based genotypic assessment of viral populations to understand the prevalence of D222G mutation. RESULTS: The D222G was identified in clinical specimens from 3 out of 42 cases analyzed in Tunisia with severe outcome (7%). Interestingly, in one fatal case out of four viruses taken from fatal cases studied (25%). Also this mutation was found in one mild case out of 8 mild cases studied (0.1%). D222E substitution was found in virus taken from one patient with severe clinical syndrome (2%) out of 42 severe cases analyzed and E374K substitution was found in two severe cases (4%) out of 42 severe cases studied. CONCLUSIONS: A specific mutation in the viral haemagglutinin (D222G) was found in fatal, severe and mild case. Further virological, clinical and epidemiological investigations are needed to ascertain the role of this and other mutations that may alter the virulence and transmissibility of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09.

These mRNAs are produced in different quantities, and their molar ratios remain constant during viral replication. We studied RNA elements that affect coronavirus transcription efficiency by characterizing a series of cloned coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs containing an inserted intergenic sequence, from which subgenomic DI RNA is transcribed in MHV-infected cells. Certain combinations of upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the intergenic sequence suppressed subgenomic DI RNA transcription, yet changing one of the flanking sequences to a different sequence eliminated transcription suppression. The suppressive effect of certain combinations of flanking sequences, but not all combinations, could be counteracted by altering the intergenic sequence. Thus, the combination of intergenic sequence and flanking sequence affected transcription efficiency. We also characterized another set of DI RNAs designed to clarify which transcription step determines the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs. Our study indicated that if subgenomic mRNAs were exclusively synthesized from negative-strand genomic RNA, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs were most likely determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA. If negative-strand subgenomic RNAs were templates for subgenomic mRNAs, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs probably were determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA used for subgenomic-sized RNA transcription but prior to the completion of the synthesis of subgenomic-sized RNAs containing the leader sequence. The relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs, therefore, seem to have been established prior to a putative replicon-type amplification of subgenomic mRNAs.","publish_time":"1998-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"An, Sungwhan; Makino, Shinji","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/134dce2133d01ee67d8b778fe9df1bdb568c98a8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682298990596; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682298990596","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI RNA","DI RNAs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subgenomic-sized RNA transcription","subgenomic DI RNA transcription","synthesis of subgenomic","relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs","species of viral subgenomic mRNAs","coronavirus transcription efficiency","different sequence","negative-strand subgenomic RNAs","sized RNAs","inserted intergenic sequence","genomic-sized template RNA","leader sequence","RNA elements","combination of intergenic sequence","putative replicon-type amplification of subgenomic mRNAs","coronavirus-infected cells","transcription step","negative-strand genomic RNA","transcription suppression","set of DI RNAs","suppressive effect of certain combinations of flanking sequences","series of cloned coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","Certain combinations of upstream","MHV-infected cells","viral replication","different quantities","defective interfering","templates","completion","study"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: With reference to a specific type of medical denialism associated with moral failure, justified by dissident AIDS and anti-vaccine scientific publications, this paper seeks to make the argument that this type of denialism meets certain longstanding definitions for classification as pseudoscience. METHODS: This paper uses a conceptual framework to make certain arguments and to juxtapose arguments for evidence-based approaches to medicine against literature that highlights certain limitations of an unquestioning approach to empiricism. RESULTS: Discussions of certain real life examples are used to derive the important insight that, under certain conditions, moral failure can result in the violation both Type I and Type II scientific error types, with catastrophic consequences. CONCLUSION: It is argued that the validity of all theory should not be assumed before sufficient empirical evidence has accumulated to support its validity across contexts.

The ViroCyt(\u00AE) Virus Counter (VC) 2100 (ViroCyt, Boulder, CO, USA) is a flow-based instrument capable of quantifying virus particles in solution. Using a proprietary combination of fluorescent dyes that stain both nucleic acid and protein in a single 30 min step, rapid, reproducible, and cost-effective quantification of filovirus particles was demonstrated. Using a seed stock of Ebola virus variant Kikwit, the linear range of the instrument was determined to be 2.8E\u002B06 to 1.0E\u002B09 virus particles per mL with coefficient of variation ranging from 9.4% to 31.5% for samples tested in triplicate. VC particle counts for various filovirus stocks were within one log of TEM particle counts. A linear relationship was established between the plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and the VC.

A total 43.2% of the Ghanaian and 56.6% of the German children tested positive for at least one respiratory virus.

In the Ghanaian rainy season, enveloped viruses were detected twice as often as non-enveloped viruses (prevalence rate ratio (PR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.7\u20132.4). In contrast, non-enveloped viruses were more frequent during the Ghanaian dry season (PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4\u20130.8).

The standardization of our sampling and laboratory testing revealed similarities in acute respiratory infection virus patterns in tropical and temperate climates.","publish_time":"2015-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annan, A.; Ebach, F.; Corman, V.M.; Krumkamp, R.; Adu-Sarkodie, Y.; Eis-H\u00FCbinger, A.M.; Kruppa, T.; Simon, A.; May, J.; Evans, J.; Panning, M.; Drosten, C.; Drexler, J.F.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3e5b91b37442a67c9437de4d9c4ac77ae804cd3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172147.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15009805; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2015.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26585774/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15009805","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Ghana","Germany"],"keyphrases":["non-enveloped viruses","common respiratory viruses","acute respiratory infections","pneumoviruses respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory infection virus patterns","Ghanaian dry season","Ghanaian rainy season","German children","virus spectra","tropical Ghana","similarities","temperate regions","Germany","colder winter season","temperate climates","Epidemiological differences","methodological differences","study sites","age associations","seasonal fluctuation","laboratory testing","prevalence rate ratio","human metapneumovirus","months","summer","sampling","comparability of data","latitude","identical molecular detection methods","standardization","PCR","contrast","younger ages","distance"],"language":"en"},

Macrophages can readily recognize the virus and eliminate it. MERS-CoV infects cells via its Spike (S) glycoprotein that binds on Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor present on macrophages. Whether this Spike/DPP4 association affects macrophage responses remains unknown. Herein we demonstrated that infection of macrophages with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S glycoprotein results in suppression of macrophage responses since it reduced the capacity of macrophages to produce TNFa and IL-6 in naive and LPS-activated THP-1 macrophages and augmented LPS-induced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. MERS-CoV S glycoprotein induced the expression of the negative regulator of TLR signaling IRAK-M as well as of the transcriptional repressor PPAR\u03B3. Inhibition of DPP4 by its inhibitor sitagliptin or siRNA abrogated the effects of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein on IRAK-M, PPAR\u03B3 and IL-10, confirming that its immunosuppressive effects were mediated by DPP4 receptor. The effect was observed both in THP-1 macrophages and human primary peripheral blood monocytes. These findings support a DPP4-mediated suppressive action of MERS-CoV in macrophages and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2017-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Qahtani, Ahmed A.; Lyroni, Konstantina; Aznaourova, Marina; Tseliou, Melpomeni; Al-Anazi, Mashael R.; Al-Ahdal, Mohammed N.; Alkahtani, Saad; Sourvinos, George; Tsatsanis, Christos","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c4450ec40a0642f9c28bb561ae210baacc032fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5354714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118607/; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14754","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["capacity of macrophages","infection of macrophages","MERS-CoV S glycoprotein results","effects of MERS","DPP4 receptor","DPP4 association","Inhibition of DPP4","suppressive action of MERS","respiratory tract","immunosuppressive effects","IRAK","Spike","immunosuppressive cytokine IL","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus","suppression of macrophage responses","LPS-activated THP","severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","augmented LPS-induced production","receptor present","transcriptional repressor PPAR\u03B3","infecting lung epithelial cells","expression","human primary peripheral blood monocytes","lentiviral particles","inhibitor sitagliptin","potential target","siRNA","negative regulator of TLR","Dipeptidyl-Peptidase","effective elimination","TNFa","pathogenicity","findings"],"language":"en"},

Group A pigs (10 animals) were inoculated with both virus and bacteria; group B pigs (10 animals) were inoculated with bacteria, group C pigs (five animals) were inoculated with virus and group D pigs (five animals) were kept as negative controls. All pigs of groups A and C became infected with PRRSV, according to virological techniques used (immunohistochemistry, virus isolation and virus serology). Lung, heart and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells were the target for PRRSV in all tissues. All pigs in groups A and B also became infected with H. parasuis based on immunohistochemical and bacterial isolation results.

However, it is not clear how these two sequences interact with each other. In this report, a previously unrecognized minor species of subgenomic mRNA, termed mRNA5\u20131, was identified in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains JHM2c, JHM(2), JHM(3), A59, and MHV-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the leader-body fusion site of the mRNA is located at approximately 150 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the consensus IG sequence for mRNA 5 and did not have sequence homology with any known IG consensus sequences. To determine whether this sequence functions independently as a promoter, we cloned a 140-nt sequence (from \u224870 nt upstream to \u224870 nt downstream of the fusion site) from viral genomic RNA and placed it in front of a reporter gene in the defective-interfering (DI) RNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. Transfection of the reporter RNA into MHV-infected cells resulted in synthesis of a CAT-specific subgenomic mRNA detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The strength of this promoter was similar to that of the IG7 (for mRNA 7) as measured by the CAT activity. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence as few as 13 nt was sufficient to initiate mRNA transcription, while mutations within the 13-nt abolished mRNA transcription. In vitro translation study confirmed that the envelope (E) protein was translated from mRNA5\u20131, which encodes the open reading frame (ORF) 5b at its 5\u2032-end, indicating that mRNA5\u20131 is a functional message. Furthermore, when the ORF5b was replaced with the CAT gene and placed in the DI in the context of viral mini-genome, CAT was expressed not only from the first ORF of mRNA5\u20131 but also from the second and third ORF of mRNA5 and genomic DI RNA, respectively, suggesting that more than one mechanism is involved in regulation of ORF5b expression. Our findings thus support the notion that base-pairing between the leader (or antileader) and the IG is not the sole mechanism in subgenomic RNA transcription.","publish_time":"2000-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xuming; Liu, Runzhong","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bc831ce14cff1516f76ad8a8cae7a90e6f4f261.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200906378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200906378","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IG","ORF"],"locations":["DI"],"keyphrases":["mRNA transcription","nt sequence","reporter RNA","CAT-specific subgenomic mRNA","consensus IG sequence","ORF of mRNA5","Sequence analysis","genomic DI RNA","CAT gene","sequence homology","sequence functions","Abstract Subgenomic RNA transcription of coronaviruses","viral genomic RNA","termed mRNA5","CAT activity","unrecognized minor species of subgenomic mRNA","RNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase","reporter gene","known IG consensus sequences","MHV-infected cells","leader-body fusion site","reporter vector","antileader","promoter","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","sole mechanism","Deletion analysis","regulation of ORF5b expression","context of viral mini-genome","synthesis","mouse hepatitis virus","strains JHM2c","defective-interfering","interaction","RT-PCR","envelope","open reading frame","base","protein","Transfection","mutations","translation study","findings","notion","strength","functional message","end","IG7","A59","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Because they do not encode components of the translational machinery, viruses exhibit an absolute dependence on the host ribosome and factors for viral messenger RNA (mRNA) translation. In order to recruit the host ribosome, viruses have evolved unique strategies to either outcompete cellular transcripts that are efficiently translated by the canonical translation pathway or to reroute translation factors and ribosomes to the viral genome. Furthermore, viruses must evade host antiviral responses and escape immune surveillance. This review focuses on some recent major findings that have revealed unconventional strategies that viruses utilize, which include usurping the host translational machinery, modulating canonical translation initiation factors to specifically enhance or repress overall translation for the purpose of viral production, and increasing viral coding capacity. The discovery of these diverse viral strategies has provided insights into additional translational control mechanisms and into the viral host interactions that ensure viral protein synthesis and replication.

The types of network models are exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and extensions of the configuration model. We use three kinds of empirical contact networks, chosen to provide both variety and realistic patterns of human contact: a highly clustered network, a bipartite network and a snowball sampled network of a \u201Chidden population\u201D. In the case of the snowball sampled network we present a novel method for fitting an edge-triangle model. In our results, ERGMs consistently capture clustering as well or better than configuration-type models, but the latter models better capture the node degree distribution. Despite the additional computational requirements to fit ERGMs to empirical networks, the use of ERGMs provides only a slight improvement in the ability of the models to recreate epidemic features of the empirical network in simulated SIR epidemics. Generally, SIR epidemic results from using configuration-type models fall between those from a random network model (i.e., an Erd\u0151s-R\u00E9nyi model) and an ERGM. The addition of subgraphs of size four to edge-triangle type models does improve agreement with the empirical network for smaller densities in clustered networks. Additional subgraphs do not make a noticeable difference in our example, although we would expect the ability to model cliques to be helpful for contact networks exhibiting household structure.","publish_time":"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rolls, David A.; Wang, Peng; McBryde, Emma; Pattison, Philippa; Robins, Garry","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b0552782eeeefd0e22a8f2c7ff55351ec6f0c3a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d7433f2be08b0e833cb270ee2ac736dce1e1a98e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/00af80743cef9bd8c04c532d74e9c67f0c9312e4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cf27e2301131c5cb6d5b67e2dd29eff6f31ead18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4640514.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555701/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ERGM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["types of network models","network features","bipartite network","grounded random network models","snowball sampled network","configuration-type models","empirical networks","configuration model","edge-triangle type models","exponential random graph models","kinds of empirical contact networks","clustered networks","use of ERGMs","edge-triangle model","SIR epidemic results","epidemic features","Erd\u0151s-R\u00E9nyi model","simulated SIR epidemics","epidemic dynamics","ability","Additional subgraphs","realistic patterns of human contact","broad types","addition of subgraphs","simulated Susceptible-Infected","additional computational requirements","agreement","smaller densities","variety","size","novel method","terms","extensions","abilities","household structure","cliques","slight improvement","noticeable difference","hidden population","node degree distribution","clustering","case","example"],"language":"en"},

These viruses evade human immunity through the evolution of variants that resist neutralization. The identification of antibodies that recognize invariant structures on the influenza haemagglutinin (HA) protein have invigorated efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines. Specifically, antibodies to the highly conserved stem region of HA neutralize diverse viral subtypes. These antibodies largely derive from a specific antibody gene, heavy-chain variable region IGHV1-69, after limited affinity maturation from their germline ancestors(1,2), but how HA stimulates naive B cells to mature and induce protective immunity is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the structural and genetic basis for their engagement and maturation into broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here we show that the germline-encoded precursors of these antibodies act as functional B-cell antigen receptors (BCRs) that initiate subsequent affinity maturation. Neither the germline precursor of a prototypic antibody, CR6261 (ref. 3), nor those of two other natural human IGHV1-69 antibodies, bound HA as soluble immunoglobulin-G (IgG). However, all three IGHV1-69 precursors engaged HA when the antibody was expressed as cell surface IgM. HA triggered BCR-associated tyrosine kinase signalling by germline transmembrane IgM. Recognition and virus neutralization was dependent solely on the heavy chain, and affinity maturation of CR6261 required only seven amino acids in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) H1 and framework region 3 (FR3) to restore full activity. These findings provide insight into the initial events that lead to the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza, informing the rational design of vaccines to elicit such antibodies and providing a model relevant to other infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS. The data further suggest that selected immunoglobulin genes recognize specific protein structural \u2018patterns\u2019 that provide a substrate for further affinity maturation.

METHODS: The study included recording of clinical signs, serology for Leishmania infection by ELISA, PCR of blood for Leishmania DNA by ITS1 HRM and kDNA PCR, parasite quantification, and trapping of sand flies around the shelter. RESULTS: Thirty-seven % (22/60) of the dogs and 75% (50/67) of the cats were seropositive to L. infantum with a significantly higher seropositivity rate in the cat population (\u03C7(2) = 42.160, P \u003C 0.0001). Twenty-five percent (15/60) of the dogs were positive for Leishmania by blood PCR, 12% by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and 22% by kDNA PCR. Of the cats, 16% (11/67) were positive by kDNA PCR and none by ITS1 HRM PCR. All the PCR-positive animals were infected by L. infantum verified by DNA sequencing and there was no significant difference between the PCR-positivity in the dog and cat populations. Altogether, 43% (26/60) of the dogs and 79% (53/67) of the cats were positive by serology or PCR for L. infantum. The average Leishmania parasite load in the blood of PCR-positive dogs (42,967 parasites/ml) was significantly higher than in PCR-positive cats (1259 parasites/ml) (t((12)) = 2.33, P = 0.037). Dogs that were positive by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and kDNA PCR had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kDNA PCR (t((11)) = \u2212 3.186580, P \u003C 0.009). No significant effect was found for FIV seropositivity on Leishmania infection in the cats (\u03C7(2) = 0.506, P = 0.777). A higher percentage of Leishmania-positive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis compared to Leishmania-positive cats (100 vs 52.8%, \u03C7(2) =15.242, P \u003C 0.0001). Phlebotomus perfiliewi, a proven vector of L. infantum, comprised 92% of trapped sand flies. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons of populations of cats and dogs exposed to sand flies and L. infantum under the same conditions indicated that although a high rate of exposure was detected in cats as manifested by a significantly greater degree of seropositivity, dogs had significantly higher blood parasite loads, and were likely to be more infectious to sand flies than cats.

Although the role of various cis-acting RNA elements in panhandle formation is well characterized, almost nothing is known about the potential contribution of protein cofactors to viral RNA cyclization. Proteins with nucleic acid chaperone activities are encoded by many viruses (e.g., retroviruses, coronaviruses) to facilitate RNA structural rearrangements and RNA\u2013RNA interactions during the viral replicative cycle. Since the core protein of flaviviruses is also endowed with potent RNA chaperone activities, we decided to examine the effect of West Nile virus (WNV) core on 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 genomic RNA annealing in vitro. Core protein binding resulted in a dramatic, dose-dependent increase in 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 complex formation. Mutations introduced in either the UAR (upstream AUG region) or CS (conserved sequence) elements of the viral RNA diminished core protein-dependent annealing, while compensatory mutations restored the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 RNA interaction. The activity responsible for stimulating RNA annealing was mapped to the C-terminal RNA-binding region of WNV core protein.

Although the Covid-19 era has forced scarce medical resource allocation to the front of our consciousness, it has always been with us, and will still be with us when Covid-19 has been vanquished 1 The authors\u2019 discussion of utilitarianism is oversimplistic here First, there are many different ways in which the utilitarian value of an action or choice can be calculated Second, and more pertinently, this discussion ignores the notion of rule utilitarianism and all of the implications that can be drawn from that, either directly or by implication For instance, if doctors start extubating patients to let them die, a rule utilitarian would ask not whether extubating patient A to save patient B is a good thing but whether extubating patients under some specific circumstances outlined in a rule about extubation, if always done, would result in more good than bad This would include a discussion of the impact on the doctor-patient relationship that would occur if doctors always did this and it was known that such practices occurred Even a basic non-rule utilitarian would consider not only the consequences for patients A and B but also the consequences if the act became known for that doctor, for all doctors, and for all patients Variations on themes of utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism in medical allocation have recently been reviewed 1 2 There is also room here for a discussion of theories of justice and social contract2,3 and how these might influence a decision as to the right option For instance, John Rawls2 has argued in a much more sophisticated fashion than I shall express here that justice is best determined by asking what people would want if they were blinded to their own role For instance, would people believe that mortally ill patients should be extubated prematurely to save other patients if they did not know whether they would be the mortally ill patient to be extubated, the patient to be saved, or even the doctor? 3 Indeed, numerous other deontological rules have been or could be proposed to guide various decisions of allocation, including egalitarian random allocation, first-come first-served, and prioritizing existing patients over new patients based on the doctor-patient contract 4,5 4 The authors conflate to some extent the notion of allocating ventilators up front with the notion of extubating a patient to give the ventilator to someone else These conditions should be clearly separated If it is the authors\u2019 intention to primarily discuss the latter, then (recognizing that arguments about the former are also somewhat relevant), they need to clearly state this up front and then focus on the question of extubation As it is written, the paper seems to end by arguing that physicians should not be allocating ventilators because that is \u201Cplaying God\u201D, but allocation is inescapable in conditions of scarcity, even if it is only first come first served (or some more sophisticated version) We routinely ration care when we send a patient out of the ICU early to make room for another patient, choose not to offer a screening colonoscopy to a healthy and asymptomatic but anxious 35 year old man (who certainly conceivably could have a colon cancer, but it seems unlikely and thus the procedure seems not cost-effective), or debate UNOS procedures for allocating organs for transplantation 4,6 5 The argument about medical futility7,8 is important and given too short shrift here Even if the authors wish to argue that it is inappropriate to extubate a patient who has a poor but real chance of survival to give the ventilator to a different patient with a better chance of survival, they need to consider separately the notion of extubating a patient who is clearly not going to survive (futile care) in order to free up a ventilator that could be used to save a patient if available now, but would not be useful later The authors may wish to reject this as well, but it should at least be considered as a distinct case 6 Overall, one wonder if the paper would be better served by laying out the arguments for and against whatever choices the author is attempting to discriminate among (see #3 above) rather than being framed as an editorial that makes a dogmatic statement about the \u201Ccorrect\u201D answer These are truly challenging issues Moral intuitions about how to make such choices vary with the case and among different people of good intent 9 Surely there is room for debate and disagreement

Here, we show that during infection, the level of coronavirus poly(A) tail lengthening depends on the initial length upon infection and that the minimum length to initiate lengthening may lie between 5 and 9 nucleotides. By mutagenesis analysis, it was found that (i) the hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail are two important elements responsible for synthesis of the coronavirus poly(A) tail and may function in concert to accomplish polyadenylation and (ii) the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. Based on these findings, we propose a process for how the coronaviral poly(A) tail is synthesized and undergoes variation.

However, the lack of a quantitative assay for LRG has limited its application. Here an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantifying LRG in human serum is described in which cytochrome c is employed as the capturing ligand and a monoclonal antibody specific for LRG is used to detect the captured glycoprotein. Application of this assay in quantifying LRG in various patients\u0027 sera is demonstrated. The concentration of LRG in sera of control subjects as determined by this assay is approximately 50 \u03BCg/ml. Consistent with expectations from published reports, LRG was found to be significantly elevated in the sera of some patients with a bacterial infection (toxic shock syndrome, TSS). LRG was only slightly elevated in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus as compared to uninfected control subjects, while normal levels of LRG were observed in patients with non-infectious diseases (inflammatory arthritis and neurological disorders, primarily Parkinson\u0027s disease). Although LRG and C-reactive protein (CRP) are both produced by the liver and are classified as acute-phase proteins, there was no significant correlation between the levels of LRG and CRP in the sera of the patients. Thus, LRG and CRP measurements are non-redundant and indicate different physiological contexts. The ELISA described in this report should be useful to further assess serum LRG as a biomarker for clinical diagnostics.","publish_time":"2008-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weivoda, Starchild; Andersen, John D.; Skogen, Aunica; Schlievert, Patrick M.; Fontana, Donna; Schacker, Timothy; Tuite, Paul; Dubinsky, Janet M.; Jemmerson, Ronald","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73ebfdd5f591df1bdf1734ab2a26f3461b87227f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094546.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175908000963; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2008.03.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175908000963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18436231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum LRG","quantifying LRG","concentration of LRG","normal levels of LRG","sera of control subjects","quantitative assay","human serum","biomarker","ELISA","CRP measurements","various patients\u0027 sera","serum glycoprotein of unknown function","captured glycoprotein","application","uninfected control subjects","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","certain diseases","non-infectious diseases","cytochrome c","human immunodeficiency virus","C-reactive protein","neurological disorders","inflammatory arthritis","bacterial infection","capturing ligand","toxic shock syndrome","microbial infections","expectations","monoclonal antibody specific","qualitative assessments","different physiological contexts","significant correlation","promise","TSS","cancer","published reports","Parkinson\u0027s disease","Abstract Leucine-rich alpha","acute-phase proteins","clinical diagnostics","\u03BCg","lack","liver"],"language":"en"},

One of the mechanisms that can help resolving infection is antibody-dependent, complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) of infected cells. ADCML consists of virus-specific antibodies that bind to cell surface expressed viral proteins which result in complement activation and cell lysis. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of FIP-virus (FIPV) infected cells towards ADCML and to examine the role of the accessory proteins 3abc and 7ab in this process. ADCML assays, using FIPV strain 79-1146 and its deletion mutant strain \u03943abc/\u03947ab, were performed on: (i) CrFK cells that show surface-expressed viral antigens, (ii) monocytes without surface-expressed viral proteins due to retention and (iii) monocytes with surface-expressed viral proteins since the antibody-mediated internalization of these proteins was blocked. As expected, no ADCML was detected of the monocytes without surface-expressed viral antigens. Surprisingly, no lysis was observed in the CrFK cells and the monocytes that do show surface-expressed viral proteins, while controls showed that the ADCML assay was functional. These experiments proof that FIPV can employ another immune evasion strategy against ADCML (besides preventing surface expression): the inhibition of complement-mediated lysis.

Objective To analyze the immune status of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 in the third trimester. Methods Along with collecting the clinical data from 51 newborns and their respective mothers, we also recorded the immunophenotypes and cytokine and immunoglobulin levels of the newborns. Results None of the 51 newborns showed fever or respiratory distress during hospitalization. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs was negative. Except for the low level of CD16-CD56 cells, the count and proportion of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 were all in the normal range. Moreover, the serum IgG and IgM levels were within the normal range, while IL-6 showed increased levels. There was no correlation between maternal COVID-19 duration and the lymphocyte subsets or cytokine levels (IFN-\u03B3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03B1). There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 levels and CD16-CD56 cells. One (1.96%) infant with an extremely elevated IL-6 concentration developed necrotizing enterocolitis in the third week after birth, and the remaining 50 infants did not show abnormal symptoms through the end of the follow-up period.

The detection of advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F\u22653) is important to identify patients who are in urgent need of antiviral treatments versus those whose treatment could be deferred (F\u22652). The aim was to assess the diagnostic value of PTX3 as a potential biomarker for clinically significant and advanced fibrosis. PTX3 associations with biochemical and histological parameters of inflammatory activity and fibrosis were investigated in 138 patients with chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) before antiviral treatment. METAVIR histological scores of activity and fibrosis were obtained. PTX3 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnostic accuracy of serum PTX3 levels was compared to that of other fibrosis markers, including transforming growth factor\u2010\u03B2(1) (TGF-\u03B2(1)), hyaluronic acid (HA), aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis score based on four factors (FIB4), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR), and the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (FibroScan\u00AE). In HCV patients the PTX3 level increased in parallel with the METAVIR histological score of activity, being independently associated with the METAVIR fibrosis score (P \u003C 0.001). Using the receiver operating characteristics analysis, the best marker for detecting F\u22652 and F\u22653 was PTX3 with AUC = 0.802 and AUC = 0.867, respectively. The area under the curve of PTX3 for predicting significant fibrosis (F\u22652) was significantly greater than those for the GPR ratio (AUC = 0.648) and FIB-4 score (AUC = 0.770) and similar to that for APRI index (AUC = 0.831).

PDCoV spike (S)\u2010specific sIgA was also detected in the colostrum and milk of immunized sows. Five days post\u2010farrowing, piglets were orally challenged with PDCoV strain NH (10(5) TCID(50)/piglet). Severe diarrhoea, high levels of viral RNA copies and substantial intestinal villus atrophy were detected in piglets born to unimmunized sows. Only 4 of 31 piglets (12.9%) born to immunized sows in the challenge group displayed mild to moderate diarrhoea, lower viral RNA copies and minor intestinal villi damage compared to piglets born to unimmunized sows post\u2010challenge. Mock piglets exhibited no typical clinical symptoms. The challenge experiment results indicated that the inactivated PDCoV vaccine exhibited 87.1% protective efficacy in the piglets. These findings suggest that the inactivated PDCoV vaccine has the potential to be an effective vaccine, providing protection against virulent PDCoV.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jialin; Chen, Jianfei; Liu, Ye; Da, Shi; Shi, Hongyan; Zhang, Xin; Liu, Jianbo; Cao, Liyan; Zhu, Xiangdong; Wang, Xiaobo; Ji, Zhaoyang; Feng, Li","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c58ab09c8c9068b939850a5e78e5c8613dcf4afb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541590/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13369","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV spike","inactivated PDCoV vaccine","PDCoV strain NH","virulent PDCoV","newborn piglets","Mock piglets","pregnant sows","milk of immunized sows","unimmunized sows post\u2010challenge","inactivated vaccine","effective vaccine","challenge model","challenge group","protective efficacy of passive immunity","challenge experiment results","lower viral RNA copies","protection efficiency of passive immunity","high levels of viral RNA copies","days post\u2010farrowing","moderate diarrhoea","Severe diarrhoea","specific IgG","specific sIgA","Pathogenicity experiments","pathogenicity of porcine deltacoronavirus","minor intestinal villi damage","substantial intestinal villus atrophy","neutralizing antibody","responses","enteropathogenic","potential","Houhai acupoint","DMEM","typical clinical symptoms","colostrum","passage","boost strategy","negative control","study","P10","findings","day\u2010old pigs","delivery","TCID","order"],"language":"en"},

Advances in diagnostic technologies such as respiratory panels (RP) utilizing polymerase chain reactions to detect viruses and determination of procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations may aid in this differentiation. However, some studies have shown limited impact for this purpose and thus continuation of antibiotics despite results suggesting viral infection. Our objective was to characterize clinician-prescribing behavior at our institution once RP and/or PCT results were known and suggestive of a viral respiratory infection. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was based upon records of hospitalized patients in whom proven or possible respiratory infections as indicated by RP testing, respiratory bacterial culture or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th revision codes for acute infectious respiratory illness was documented. Patients evaluated were required to have a RP or PCT within the first 72 h of presentation. Drug orders were evaluated for discontinuation of antibiotic therapy within 48 h of a procalcitonin of \u003C0.25 \u03BCg/mL, a positive viral RP result, or both. RESULTS: Of 4869 patients with PCT and/or RP results, 2031 were included. PCT and RP testing were obtained in 503 and 1823 patients, respectively, with 295 patients having both. Results of these tests suggested 789 patients were potential candidates for antibiotic avoidance. These included 219 with a PCT \u003C0.25 \u03BCg/mL, 601 with a positive viral RP result, and 31 with both. Antibiotics were administered to 307 patients (39%) within the first 72 h. In these, antibiotics were discontinued within 48 h of laboratory results availability. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that positive viral RP and low PCT results are infrequently associated with discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in proven or possible respiratory infections at our institution. Direct interventions with clinicians are likely needed to correct this behavior and decrease unnecessary antibiotic use.

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Xiaolong; Li, Cheng; Huang, Ailing; Xia, Shuai; Lu, Sicong; Shi, Zhengli; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo; Yang, Zhenlin; Wu, Yanling; Ying, Tianlei","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/123ea6f7fb7c9dbde72ca2a6a5f1c5d0986966ab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV RBD","nCoV infections","RBD of SARS","anti-SARS CoV antibodies","nCoV spike protein","potent SARS-CoV","specific neutralizing antibodies","therapeutic antibodies","novel monoclonal antibodies","ACE2 binding site of SARS","human infections","specific human monoclonal antibody","cross-reactivity","binding domain","specific antiviral treatment","human health","epitope of CR3022","novel coronavirus","rapid development of vaccines","important implications","CR3014","high identity of receptor","serious threat","deaths","combination","critical impact","m396","difference","prevention","candidate therapeutics","potential","KD","nM","laboratory","time","results"],"language":"en"},

Bats appear to have some unique features in their innate immune system that inhibit viral replication causing limited clinical symptoms, and thus, contributing to the virus spill over to humans. Here, kidney epithelial cell lines derived from four bat species (Pteropus dasymallus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Miniopterus fuliginosus) and two non-bat species (Homo sapiens and Mesocricetus auratus) were infected with EMCV and JEV. The replication of EMCV and JEV was lower in the bat cell lines derived from R. leschenaultii, R. ferrumequinum, and M. fuliginosus with a higher expression level of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) and interferon-beta (IFN-\u03B2) than that in the non-bat cell lines and a bat cell line derived from P. dasymallus. The knockdown of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in Rhinolophus bat cell line using antisense RNA oligonucleotide led to decrease IFN-\u03B2 expression and increased viral replication. These results suggest that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 are important for antiviral response against EMCV and JEV in Rhinolophus bats.","publish_time":"2020-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tarigan, Ronald; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Doysabas, Karla Cristine C.; Ken, Maeda; Iida, Atsuo; Hondo, Eiichi","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f52214db7ed2c454f66f39525c9cf510c3261866.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177169.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20307865; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20307865","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mesocricetus"],"organizations":["EMCV","JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rhinolophus bat cell line","non-bat cell lines","JEV","replication of EMCV","non-bat species","Rhinolophus bats","MDA5","RIG","kidney epithelial cell lines","Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","IFN-\u03B2 expression","increased viral replication","Abstract Bats","knockdown of TLR3","Japanese encephalitis virus","Rousettus leschenaultii","Miniopterus fuliginosus","Pteropus dasymallus","potential natural hosts of Encephalomyocarditis virus","higher expression level of pattern recognition receptors","antisense RNA oligonucleotide","innate immune system","PRRs","Homo sapiens","Mesocricetus auratus","antiviral response","unique features","limited clinical symptoms","interferon-beta","results","humans"],"language":"en"},

Asthma has strong genetic and environmental components that interact both in the induction and subsequent expression of the disease phenotypes. Multiple genes are involved and probably interact. Whole genome screens are beginning to identify gene-rich regions of special relevance to asthma and atopy, although a novel disease-related gene has yet to be discovered from these. By contrast, there are a plethora of candidate genes whose function in relation to disease pathophysiologic mechanisms and response to treatment are known. Two examples are polymorphisms involving IL-4 receptors and the enzymes controlling cysteinyl leukotriene production. Abnormal signaling between the epithelium, which is in contact with the environment, and the underlying (myo)fibroblasts and dendritic cells indicating reactivation of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit, which is involved in fetal lung development and branching, provide a basis for asthma that encapsulates both TH2 polarization and airway wall remodeling.

MERS CoV polymerase shares more than 20% sequence identity with the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-structural 5b (NS5b) RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Despite the low sequence identity, the active site is conserved between the two proteins, with two consecutive aspartates that are crucial in the nucleotide transfer reaction.

In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food. METHODS: We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9\u00B78\u201351\u00B79% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10\u201350%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. FINDINGS: Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9\u00B78\u201318\u00B75% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39\u00B73\u201351\u00B79% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9\u00B78\u201344\u00B77% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8\u00B73\u201338\u00B76% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18\u201323% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

In this work, mass spectral profiling, a new tool for data processing is proposed to help a lot in solving this problem as gas chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy (GC\u2013MS) is used to detect both the active and non-active ingredients buried in HMs. The main idea of mass spectral profiling is employment of target m/z points of GC\u2013MS data on the extraction of chromatographic profiles of pure and/or mixed compositions concerned. Further, the absolute or relative abundance at these m/z points can be utilized for results interpretation. With the help of this tool, the qualitative and quantitative information of chemical components within complicated HMs will be mined out effectively. It can then be recommended as reference indices to assess the importance of target compositions in HMs, such as efficacy evaluation on disease treatment of the active constituents. Mass spectral profiling with less data points significantly improves the possibility to get the rich information with no strong requirements of data preprocessing procedures, like alignment of shift of retention times among different chromatographic profiles. It is powerful for quality control of HMs coupled with pattern recognition techniques on high-throughput data sets. In this study, a commonly used herbal medicine, Houttuynia cordata Thunb and its finished injection products, were used to deliver the strategies. Absolutely, the working principles can be extended to the investigation of metabonomics with gas chromatography\u2013time-of-flight\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS\u2013TOF).

Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen. RESULTS: 112 patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhoea. All patients underwent antibody tests. Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both IgM and IgG, 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG.

However, things have not turned out that way, due to both the continual progress witnessed in plasma fractionation and viral-reduction technologies and technical difficulties still being encountered in developing more cost-effective non-immunogenic, fully active recombinant therapeutic proteins. Accordingly, plasma fractionation remains a reasonably healthy industry worldwide, with an ever-increasing volume of plasma fractionated each year to meet the demands for safe and effective plasma-derived medicines at the global level. While high-income countries currently have generally good access to a panel of plasma-derived and recombinant products, desperate shortages of fractionated plasma products remain in developing economies, and patients still have to be treated inadequately. The steady development of the collection of whole blood in developing economies, to gradually cover the recognized needs for red blood cell concentrates, generates an increasing volume of recovered plasma that is currently wasted. Incentives are therefore high for those countries to consider fractionating such plasma as a means of enhancing their supply of products to treat patients, thereby also decreasing the level of dependence on imported products. Challenges of local plasma fractionation in developing economies are high, in a context where the technological and regulatory sophistication of the plasma fractionation industry is often underestimated, and the blood supply may be exposed to emerging infectious agents. In parallel, plasma product quality requirements and drivers are evolving in developed economies as is the awareness of clinicians to newer uses of products such as intravenous immunoglobulins, somewhat deviating from what currently remain the basic needs of developing countries in terms of affordable safe plasma products. Global market trends for plasma-derived products, through plasma fractionation, are still increasing, despite increasing use of recombinant products, and attention is being focused on the five Ws of the fractionation field: which products; where; when; what and how much; and who will be the main suppliers?","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burnouf, Thierry; Seghatchian, Jerard","journal":"Transfusion and Apheresis Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ac5b28ce502aee2cf401d2c721201364cd412ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106424.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050214001712; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050214001712","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma-derived products","panel of plasma","plasma fractionation industry","supply of products","terms of affordable safe plasma products","ever-increasing volume of plasma","desperate shortages of fractionated plasma products","Challenges of local plasma fractionation","safe recombinant products","imported products","plasma-derived coagulation factor","effective plasma-derived medicines","increasing volume of recovered plasma","use of recombinant products","plasma product quality requirements","developing economies","newer uses of products","fractionation field","developed economies","basic needs of developing countries","developed countries","high-income countries","blood supply","year","global level","patients","active recombinant therapeutic proteins","red blood cell concentrates","recognized needs","level of dependence","reasonably healthy industry","Global market trends","epidemic","transfusion-transmitted infections","viral-reduction technologies","HIV","drivers","regulatory sophistication","human immunodeficiency virus","hemophiliacs","context","awareness of clinicians","good access","collection","technical difficulties","continual progress","demands","intravenous immunoglobulins","advanced thinkers","attention","means","steady development","way","Abstract","Ws","Incentives","infectious agents","main suppliers","things"],"language":"en"},

GI preparations from porcine gastric mucosa, mouse intestine, and in neuramide (a pharmaceutical product), were examined for broad antiviral activity, molecular size and mechanism of action for comparison with the previously characterized, innate inhibitors in the serum and nervous system. The GI inhibitors were found to be active in high titers against RNA and DNA viruses, resistant to proteolysis, glycolysis, lipid extraction and possessed differing mechanisms of action. The mouse intestinal inhibitor prevented virus attachment to cells, and neuramide acted at an early post-attachment stage of virus multiplication. The porcine mucosal inhibitor acted as late as 6 h after initiation of the multiplication cycle. These broadly active GI inhibitors differed from the previously described serum inhibitor (UTI\u03B2) high density lipoproteins (HDL) and the nervous system (NS) inhibitor by being smaller (600\u00B1400 kDa) and resistant to proteinase K, glycosidases and organic solvents. The mouse intestinal inhibitor acts similarly to UTI\u03B2 and NS inhibitor by preventing attachment of virus to the cells. In comparison, the neuramide and the porcine mucosal inhibitor, like HDL, acted after attachment to the target cells. The innate nonspecific, broadly-active virus inhibitors, based on high titers and location, are considered important initial immune defense mechanisms against viral infections and thus potentially useful in medical applications.","publish_time":"2001-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Indra P; Coppenhaver, Dorian H; Chopra, Ashok K; Baron, Samuel","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1be944b5ecb82fea11b242d7170ef1eeeb27c1cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126173.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354200001406; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354200001406","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS inhibitor","active virus inhibitors","active GI inhibitors","virus attachment","attachment of virus","mouse intestinal inhibitor","porcine mucosal inhibitor","innate inhibitors","described serum inhibitor","neuramide","nervous system","Abstract Innate viral inhibitors","high titers","GI preparations","early post-attachment stage of virus multiplication","UTI\u03B2","HDL","mouse intestine","comparison","target cells","high density lipoproteins","porcine gastric mucosa","differing mechanisms of action","viral infections","mechanism of action","multiplication cycle","important initial immune defense mechanisms","molecular size","DNA viruses","glycolysis","proteolysis","lipid extraction","RNA","broad antiviral activity","proteinase","location","glycosidases","organic solvents","initiation","kDa","medical applications","pharmaceutical product"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies demonstrated that PEDF displays cytoprotective activity in several cell types. However, it remains unknown whether PEDF is involved in glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast death. The aim of this study was to examine the role of PEDF in osteoblast survival in response to dexamethasone, an active glucocorticoid analogue, and explore the underlying mechanism. In the present study, dexamethasone (DEX) was used to induce MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis. PEDF mRNA and protein levels and cell apoptosis were determined respectively. Then PEDF receptor (PEDF-R)- and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-related signal transductions were assessed. Here we show that DEX down-regulates PEDF expression, which contributes to osteoblast apoptosis. As a result, exogenous recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) inhibited DEX-induced cell apoptosis. We confirmed that PEDF-R was expressed on MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast membrane and could bind to PEDF which increased the level of LPA and activated the phosphorylation of Akt. Our results suggest that PEDF attenuated DEX-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts through LPA-dependent Akt activation via PEDF-R.","publish_time":"2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Shengcheng; Zhang, Yingnan; Wang, Xiaoyu; Zhao, Fengchao; Sun, Maji; Zheng, Xin; Dong, Hongyan; Guo, Kaijin","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92f465e2f870b70dfea013a01bc9ccfa46c511de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4881552.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17050730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27187377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDF","LPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDF-R","PEDF mRNA","role of PEDF","PEDF expression","PEDF receptor","PEDF attenuated DEX-induced apoptosis","exogenous recombinant PEDF","DEX-induced cell apoptosis","MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis","MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast membrane","osteoblast survival","glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast death","MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts","cell types","cell-type dependent","LPA-dependent Akt activation","level of LPA","dexamethasone","phosphorylation of Akt","present study","active glucocorticoid analogue","biological actions","rPEDF","response","cytoprotective activity","lysophosphatidic acid","protein levels","multifunctional secreted glycoprotein","related signal transductions","Pigment epithelial-derived factor","Recent studies","results","underlying mechanism","aim"],"language":"en"},

Here, we tested 127 tissue samples from swine from Fujian Province that presented respiratory symptoms. All of the PCV3 positive samples were negative for many other pathogens involved in respiratory diseases like PCV2, PRRSV, and CSFV, suggesting that PCV3 is potentially pathogenic. From phylogenetic analysis, PCV3 strains are divided into two main clades and five sub-clades; PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, PCV3b-1, and PCV3b-2. Our identified strains belong to genotypes PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, and PCV3b-2, indicating a high degree of genetic diversity of PCV3 in Fujian province until 2019. Interestingly, we found the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of PCV3 was dated to the 1950s, and PCV3 has a similar evolutionary rate as PCV2 (the main epidemic genotypes PCV2b and PCV2d). In addition, positive selection sites N56D/S and S77T/N on the capsid gene are located on the PCV3 antigen epitope, indicating that PCV3 is gradually adaptive in swine.

This study was a cross-sectional study. In this study, social and economic factors were classified into three dimensions: built environment, economic activities, and public service status. The method applied in this study was the spatial regression analysis. In the 13 districts in Wuhan, the spatial regression analysis was applied. The results showed that: 1) increasing population density, construction land area proportion, value-added of tertiary industry per unit of land area, total retail sales of consumer goods per unit of land area, public green space density, aged population density were associated with an increased COVID-19 morbidity rate due to the positive characteristics of estimated coefficients of these variables. 2) increasing average building scale, GDP per unit of land area, and hospital density were associated with a decreased COVID-19 morbidity rate due to the negative characteristics of estimated coefficients of these variables. It was concluded that it is possible to control infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, by adjusting social and economic factors.

The current standard of care leads to a sustained viral response of roughly 50% of treated patients at best. Furthermore, anti-viral therapy is expensive, prolonged, and associated with serious side-effects. Evidence suggests that a poor response to treatment may be the result of a suppressed anti-viral immunity due to the presence of increased numbers and activity of CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T cells (Treg cells). We and others have recently identified fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) as a putative effector of Treg cells, which accounts for their suppressive function through binding to Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03B3R). In an experimental model of fulminant viral hepatitis, our laboratory showed that increased plasma levels of FGL2 pre- and post-viral infection were predictive of susceptibility and severity of disease. Moreover, treatment with antibody to FGL2 fully protected susceptible animals from the lethality of the virus, and adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg cells into resistant fgl2-deficient animals accelerated their mortality post-infection. In patients with HCV infection, plasma levels of FGL2 and expression of FGL2 in the liver correlated with the course and severity of the disease. Collectively, these studies suggest that FGL2 may be used as a biomarker to predict disease progression in HCV patients and be a logical target for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients with HCV infection.","publish_time":"2010-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shalev, Itay; Selzner, Nazia; Helmy, Ahmed; Foerster, Katharina; Adeyi, Oyedele A.; Grant, David R.; Levy, Gary","journal":"Rambam Maimonides Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61573a5ebe4f84a5b5738bc12a3c18d2bf69651c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3721661.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5041/rmmj.10004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23908776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","post-viral infection","expression of FGL2","HCV patients","treatment of patients","severity of disease","increased plasma levels of FGL2 pre-","resistant fgl2-deficient animals","type Treg cells","mortality post-infection","anti-viral therapy","sustained viral response","treated patients","disease progression","putative effector of Treg cells","suppressed anti-viral immunity","leading cause of liver disease","regulatory T cells","experimental model of fulminant viral hepatitis","liver transplantation","Chronic hepatitis C virus","poor response","protected susceptible animals","presence of increased numbers","adoptive transfer of wild","predictive of susceptibility","binding","result","laboratory","Fc gamma receptors","development of novel therapeutic approaches","logical target","suppressive function","lethality","antibody","activity of CD4","Fc\u03B3R","Foxp3","biomarker","common indication","current standard of care","CD25","course","serious side-effects","Evidence","best","fibrinogen","protein","studies"],"language":"en"},

In this study, eight additional gC negative (gC\u2212) mutants derived from KOS-321 were shown to vary widely in their ability to induce lethal encephalitis in female DBA/2 mice following intracerebral inoculation. This variation in virulence showed no correlation with thymidine kinase activity. One less virulent gC\u2212 strain, gC\u221239, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC\u002B recombinant virions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC\u2212viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC\u002B) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse model of HSV-induced encephalitis and that cotransfection procedures can induce additional mutations that affect viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"1988-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sunstrum, James C.; Chrisp, Clarence E.; Levine, Myron; Glorioso, Joseph C.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1744b0e2a215bbb4532bc4644046750c8ba96d23.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170288900640; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170288900640","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gC gene","gC positive","virulent gC","additional gC negative","pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies","induced encephalitis","lethal encephalitis","development of encephalitis","virus recombinants","wild-type virus level of neurovirulence","structural gene","mutant of herpes simplex virus type","virulence determinant","ability","strain KOS","mouse model of HSV","standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures","additional mutations","previous study","resulting progeny","passive immunization of mice","mouse central nervous system","female DBA","pathogenicity","effect","individual plaque","correlation","glycoprotein C","viruses","laboratory","deletion","findings","acquisition","mutants","thymidine kinase activity","intracerebral inoculation","diseased brain tissues","agreement","viral pathogenesis","recombinant virions","K\u00FCmel","neurovirulent phenotype","variation"],"language":"en"},

Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Method Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from 20 January to 10 February 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi\u0027s 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into four themes. Firstly, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Secondly, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Thirdly, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Niuniu; Shi, Suling; Jiao, Dandan; Song, Runluo; Ma, Lili; Wang, Hongwei; Wang, Chao; Wang, Zhaoguo; You, Yanli; Liu, Shuhua; Wang, Hongyun","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/738e1b0f7762166beac9bc707ad5b879b22a998b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141468.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320302017?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320302017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive emotions","patients","COVID","negative emotions present","psychological experience of nurses","front-line nurses","psychology of nurses","psychological growth","mental health of nurses","early stage","self-coping styles","pressure","step method","life adjustment","team support","altruistic acts","important role","development of professional responsibility","fear","gratefulness","Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science","increased affection","concern","anxiety","fatigue","epidemic outbreak","high-intensity work","helplessness","discomfort","rational cognition","self-reflection","Technology","Colaizzi\u0027s","challenges","nursing staff","Conclusions","family members","phenomenological approach","care","telephone","coronavirus disease","Objective","interviews","themes"],"language":"en"},

The ubiquitous nature of Norovirus necessitates simple and rapid detection methods with high accuracy and sensitivity. To this end, several investigators have evaluated the usefulness of commercial reverse\u2010transcription loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (RT\u2010LAMP) kits for detecting Norovirus genogroups I (GI) and II (GII). In previous studies, the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII showed a relatively high detection rate, while that for Norovirus GI showed a relatively low detection rate. In the present study, clinical Norovirus specimens were used to compare the detection rate of a modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI with the rates of the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI and an \u201Cin\u2010house\u201D RT\u2010LAMP GI primer set, methods which had a high detection rate. Results from the present study showed that the modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI had a higher detection rate for two viral genotypes (GI.3, GI.11). On comparison with an \u201Cin\u2010house\u201D GII primer set using genotype GII.4 viruses circulating recently, the detection rate by the Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII was found to be higher, with a 98% detection rate. These results indicate the applicability of the modified LAMP kit for GI and the conventional LAMP kit for GII for detection of Noroviruses in clinical samples. J. Med.

In the present study, a virulent Korean pandemic PEDV strain, KNU-141112, was serially propagated in Vero cells for up to 100 passages. Through cell culture adaptation, we obtained four distinct deletion (DEL) mutants by plaque purification followed by nucleotide sequencing of the spike (S)/ORF3 gene-coding region, which were designated KNU-141112-S DEL2, \u2212S DEL5, \u2212S DEL2/ORF3, and \u2212S DEL5/ORF3. Further whole genome sequencing identified 12 or 14 amino acid changes in the cell-adapted DEL strains. Animal inoculation studies revealed that the virulence of both S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3 viruses with a large 46-nt deletion in the intergenic portion of S and ORF3 was remarkably diminished, indicating viral attenuation in the natural host. Furthermore, these cell-adapted strains elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses in immunized pigs. Taken together, our data indicate that the cell-attenuated S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3 strains are promising candidates for the development of a safe and effective live PEDV vaccine.","publish_time":"2017-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sunhee; Son, Kyu-Yeol; Noh, Yun-Hee; Lee, Seung-Chul; Choi, Hwan-Won; Yoon, In-Joong; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f953b3d21ebfd22f0c0f4bd7f579de50196578f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172462.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757031/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.06.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517303954; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517303954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S DEL5","ORF3 strains","cell-attenuated S DEL2","ORF3 viruses","intergenic portion of S","cell-adapted strains","ORF3 gene-coding region","cell culture adaptation","designated KNU","effective live PEDV vaccine","nt deletion","nucleotide sequencing","distinct deletion","genome sequencing","virulent Korean pandemic PEDV strain","potent neutralizing antibody responses","development","virulence","promising candidates","major pig","immunized pigs","mutants","spike","present study","viral attenuation","plaque purification","significant financial threat","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","amino acid changes","natural host","Animal inoculation studies","countries","Vero cells","passages","data"],"language":"en"},

Then, to identify the factors associated with these performance measures, we ran multivariate Poisson regression models adjusted for the characteristics of the simulated time series (trend, seasonality, dispersion, outbreak sizes, etc.). The FPR ranged from 0.7% to 59.9% and the POD from 43.3% to 88.7%. Some methods had a very high specificity, up to 99.4%, but a low sensitivity. Methods with a high sensitivity (up to 79.5%) had a low specificity. All methods had a high negative predictive value, over 94%, while positive predictive values ranged from 6.5% to 68.4%. Multivariate Poisson regression models showed that performance measures were strongly influenced by the characteristics of time series. Past or current outbreak size and duration strongly influenced detection performances.","publish_time":"2017-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00E9dubourg, Gabriel; Le Strat, Yann","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ea62d48ba2e9f9c122aa34759f9bcb5451a09f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5513450.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["methods","probability of detection","temporal outbreak detection","detection performances","detection method","high specificity","high sensitivity","simulated time series","characteristics of time series","positive predictive values","low specificity","low sensitivity","high negative predictive value","multivariate Poisson regression models","performance measures","outbreak sizes","FPR","POD","large dataset of simulated weekly surveillance time series","current outbreak size","panel of statistical algorithms","false positive rate","R package surveillance","seasonality","duration","trend","dispersion","systematic assessment","paper","factors","objective"],"language":"en"},

Nasal swabs were collected from 114 cattle on initial BRD treatment. Processing included modified live virus (MLV) vaccination. Seven BRD necropsy cases were included for 121 total cases. Mean number of days on feed before first sample was 14.9 days. Swabs and tissue homogenates were tested by gel based PCR (G-PCR), quantitative-PCR (qPCR) and quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and viral culture. There were 87/114 (76.3%) swabs positive for at least one virus by at least one test. All necropsy cases were positive for at least one virus. Of 121 cases, positives included 18/121 (14.9%) BoHV-1; 19/121 (15.7%) BVDV; 76/121 (62.8%) BoCV; 11/121 (9.1%) BRSV; and 10/121 (8.3%) PI3V. For nasal swabs, G-PCR (5 viruses) detected 44/114 (38.6%); q-PCR and qRT-PCR (4 viruses) detected 81/114 (71.6%); and virus isolation detected 40/114 (35.1%). Most were positive for only one or two tests, but not all three tests. Necropsy cases had positives: 5/7 G-PCR, 5/7 q-PCR and qRT-PCR, and all were positive by cell culture. In some cases, G-PCR and both real time PCR were negative for BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V in samples positive by culture. PCR did not differentiate field from vaccines strains of BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V. However based on sequencing and analysis, field and vaccine strains of culture positive BoHV-1, BoCV, BVDV, and PI3V, 11/18 (61.1%) of BoHV-1 isolates, 6/17 (35.3%) BVDV isolates, and 1/10 (10.0%) PI3V identified as vaccine. BRSV was only identified by PCR testing. Interpretation of laboratory tests is appropriate as molecular based tests and virus isolation cannot separate field from vaccine strains. Additional testing using sequencing appears appropriate for identifying vaccine strains.","publish_time":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fulton, R.W.; d\u2019Offay, J.M.; Landis, C.; Miles, D.G.; Smith, R.A.; Saliki, J.T.; Ridpath, J.F.; Confer, A.W.; Neill, J.D.; Eberle, R.; Clement, T.J.; Chase, C.C.L.; Burge, L.J.; Payton, M.E.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f6470175fa154e8c272bcf522ff6305d532e378.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173208.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16301499; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.04.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16301499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27108192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","BVDV","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G-PCR","qRT-PCR","quantitative-PCR","q-PCR","PCR testing","real time PCR","PI3V","virus isolation","swabs positive","vaccine strains of culture positive BoHV","BRD necropsy cases","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","bovine viral diarrhea virus","total cases","BVDV isolates","quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR","vaccines strains of BoHV","samples positive","modified live virus","bovine coronaviruses","bovine herpesvirus","field","viral culture","BoCV","BRSV","Nasal swabs","bovine respiratory disease","molecular based tests","cell culture","Interpretation of laboratory tests","sequencing","positives","initial BRD treatment","Additional testing","Mean number of days","qPCR","MLV","cattle","feedlots","gel","parainfluenza","Processing","vaccination","study","analysis","tissue homogenates"],"language":"en"},

Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be a Betacoronavirus (lineage B) closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been reported to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Subsequently, betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaimes, Javier A.; Andr\u00E9, Nicole M.; Chappie, Joshua S.; Millet, Jean K.; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"J Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/257078435f41c59543aa5ddddffbc493268f00ff.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5b735098052388a82cf2a17bd338fa01109807bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166309.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283620302874; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620302874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320687/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","evolution of SARS","SARS-related bat coronaviruses","common receptor","extended structural loop","receptor binding module","similar receptor utilization","structural modeling","betacoronaviruses","Betacoronavirus lineage B","fusion activation","basic amino acids","low amino acid similarity","major outbreak of respiratory disease","major public health concern","entry properties","interface","S1","Hubei province","close relatives","support","key component","virus stability","transmission","nCoV","global pandemic","China","lineages","S2","pangolins","data","spike glycoprotein","novel coronavirus","domains"],"language":"en"},

To inform risk assessment, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of MERS global dissemination and looked for factors explaining the heterogeneity observed in transmission events following importation. METHODS: We reviewed imported MERS cases worldwide up to July 2015. We modelled importations in time based on air travel combined with incidence in Middle East. We used the detailed history of MERS case management after importation (time to hospitalization and isolation, number of hospitals visited,\u2026) in logistic regression to identify risk factors for secondary transmission. We assessed changes in time to hospitalization and isolation in relation to collective and public health attention to the epidemic, measured by three indicators (Google Trends, ProMED-mail, Disease Outbreak News). RESULTS: Modelled importation events were found to reproduce both the temporal and geographical structure of those observed \u2013 the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed monthly time series was large (r = 0.78, p \u003C 10(\u22124)). The risk of secondary transmission following importation increased with the time to case isolation or death (OR = 1.7 p = 0.04) and more precisely with the duration of hospitalization (OR = 1.7, p = 0.02). The average daily number of secondary cases was 0.02 [0.0,0.12] in the community and 0.20 [0.03,9.0] in the hospital. Time from hospitalisation to isolation decreased in periods of high public health attention (2.33 \u00B1 0.34 vs. 6.44 \u00B1 0.97 days during baseline attention). CONCLUSIONS: Countries at risk of importation should focus their resources on strict infection control measures for the management of potential cases in healthcare settings and on prompt MERS cases identification. Individual and collective awareness are key to substantially improve such preparedness.

Conclusions: The serum IP-10 level was increased in AMI, and a higher level of serum IP-10 before PCI may be informative regarding infarct size.","publish_time":"2008-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koten, Kazuya; Hirohata, Satoshi; Miyoshi, Toru; Ogawa, Hiroko; Usui, Shinichi; Shinohata, Ryoko; Iwamoto, Mutsumi; Kitawaki, Tomoki; Kusachi, Shozo; Sakaguchi, Kosaku; Ohe, Tohru","journal":"Clinical Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54335c6cd611a9be08fe6e56476d5186605c86da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094408.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912007003724; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912007003724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMI","AP","PCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AMI patients","higher serum IP","higher level of serum IP","PCI","serum levels of interferon","pg","peak CK","independent predictor of cumulative CK release","stable angina pectoris patients","isoenzyme CK-MB","AP","infarct size","control subjects","normal subjects","cumulative release of creatine kinase","blood samples","acute myocardial infarction","percutaneous coronary intervention","gamma-inducible protein","inflammation-induced chemokine","Stepwise multiple regression analysis","methods","Abstract Objectives","Design","days","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data. In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses. An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

During replication, 1a provides RNA capping, NTPase and possibly RNA helicase functions. Here we identify in BMV 1a an amphipathic \u03B1-helix, helix A, and use NMR analysis to define its structure and propensity to insert in hydrophobic membrane-mimicking micelles. We show that helix A is essential for efficient 1a\u2013ER membrane association and normal perinuclear ER localization, and that deletion or mutation of helix A abolishes RNA replication. Strikingly, mutations in helix A give rise to two dramatically opposite 1a function phenotypes, implying that helix A acts as a molecular switch regulating the intricate balance between separable 1a functions. One class of helix A deletions and amino acid substitutions markedly inhibits 1a\u2013membrane association and abolishes ER membrane invagination, viral RNA template recruitment, and replication, but doubles the 1a-mediated increase in 2a(Pol) accumulation. The second class of helix A mutations not only maintains efficient 1a\u2013membrane association but also amplifies the number of 1a-induced membrane invaginations 5- to 8-fold and enhances viral RNA template recruitment, while failing to stimulate 2a(Pol) accumulation. The results provide new insights into the pathways of RNA replication complex assembly and show that helix A is critical for assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complex, including its central role in targeting replication components and controlling modes of 1a action.","publish_time":"2009-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ling; Westler, William M.; den Boon, Johan A.; Wang, Xiaofeng; Diaz, Arturo; Steinberg, H.

This study showed a high prevalence of rotavirus in both groups with no significant difference between the two. No significant differences regarding G, P and G/P rotavirus genotype distribution between the two groups were observed, with G6, P[5] and G6P[5] genotypes being by far the most prevalent. Moreover, sequence analyses of the VP7 and VP4 partial coding genes of the G6P[5] strains from this study did not allow us to distinguish them according to their origin. This study also showed that other pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea, such as genogroup III noroviruses and neboviruses, were not more frequently associated with calf diarrhoea in vaccinated herds.

The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework aims to improve the sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential and increase access of developing countries to vaccines and other life-saving products during a pandemic. Under the Framework, countries have been supported to enhance their capacities to detect, prepare for and respond to pandemic influenza. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, seven countries are priority countries for Laboratory and Surveillance (L\u0026S) support: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Yemen. During 2014\u20132017, US$ 2.7 million was invested in regional capacity-building and US$ 4.6 million directly in the priority countries. Countries were supported to strengthen influenza diagnostic capacities to improve detection, enhance influenza surveillance systems including sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness, and increase global sharing of surveillance data and influenza viruses. This paper highlights the progress made in improving influenza preparedness and response capacities in the Region from 2014 to 2017, and the challenges faced. By 2017, 18 of the 22 countries of the Region had laboratory-testing capacity, 19 had functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems and 22 had trained national rapid response teams. The number of countries correctly identifying all influenza viruses in the WHO external quality assurance panel increased from 9 countries scoring 100% in 2014 to 15 countries in 2017, and the number sharing influenza viruses with WHO collaborating centres increased by 75% (from eight to 14 countries); more than half now share influenza data with regional or global surveillance platforms. Seven countries have estimated influenza disease burden and seven have introduced influenza vaccination for high-risk groups. Challenges included: protracted complex emergencies faced by nine countries which hindered implementation of influenza surveillance in areas with the most needs, high staff turnover, achieving timely virus sharing and limited utilization of influenza data where they are available to inform vaccine policies or establish threshold values to measure the start and severity of influenza seasons.","publish_time":"2019-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abubakar, Abdinasir; Elkholy, Amgad; Barakat, Amal; Shrestha, Bhagawan; Elhakim, Mohamed; Malik, Mamunur Rahman; Bergeri, Isabel; Samaan, Gina","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/680db4e858f7593c9fb07c550cb08669d725f7be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102835.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.03.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119301157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905541/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119301157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Djibouti"],"keyphrases":["influenza vaccination","sharing of influenza viruses","implementation of influenza surveillance","Pandemic Influenza Preparedness","priority countries","number of countries","influenza diagnostic capacities","sentinel influenza surveillance systems","influenza disease burden","severity of influenza seasons","limited utilization of influenza data","access of developing countries","sentinel surveillance","global sharing of surveillance data","pandemic potential","global surveillance platforms","Eastern Mediterranean Region","response capacities","regional capacity","Framework","challenges","laboratory-testing capacity","national rapid response teams","severe acute respiratory infection","timely virus","Jordan","Egypt","Djibouti","detection","high staff turnover","Lebanon","Afghanistan","needs","support","vaccines","start","life","external quality assurance panel","areas","illness","humans","threshold values","vaccine policies","Morocco","protracted complex emergencies","PIP","half","Yemen","products","high-risk groups","progress","centres","paper"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the molecular details of this process is essential for antiviral strategies. Recent structural studies revealed a stunning diversity of viral fusion proteins in their native state. In spite of this diversity, the post-fusion structures of these proteins share a common trimeric hairpin motif in which the amino- and carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domains are positioned at the same end of a rod-shaped molecule. The converging hairpin motif, along with biochemical and functional data, implies that disparate viral proteins promote membrane merger via a universal \u0022cast-and-fold\u0022 mechanism. According to this model, fusion proteins first anchor themselves to the target membrane through their hydrophobic segments and then fold back, bringing the viral and cellular membranes together and forcing their merger. However, the pathways of protein refolding and the mechanism by which this refolding is coupled to membrane rearrangements are still not understood. The availability of specific inhibitors targeting distinct steps of HIV-1 entry permitted the identification of key conformational states of its envelope glycoprotein en route to fusion. These studies provided functional evidence for the direct engagement of the target membrane by HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein prior to fusion and revealed the role of partially folded pre-hairpin conformations in promoting the pore formation.","publish_time":"2008-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melikyan, Gregory B","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bb40f09f39920c4c618e51f062f0c46c5f777b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2633019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19077194/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-5-111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specialized fusion proteins","merger of viral","stunning diversity of viral fusion proteins","disparate viral proteins","membrane merger","target membrane","viral cores","post-fusion structures","membrane rearrangements","envelope glycoprotein","converging hairpin motif","mechanism","common trimeric hairpin motif","folded pre-hairpin conformations","functional data","functional evidence","cell membranes","cellular membranes","hydrophobic segments","distinct steps of HIV","Recent structural studies","pathways of protein refolding","carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domains","entry","role","direct engagement","identification of key conformational states","process","cytosolic release","cast","anchor","availability of specific inhibitors","Enveloped viruses","native state","pore formation","end","molecular details","antiviral strategies","model","rod-shaped molecule","spite"],"language":"en"},

Although generic protein composition of RJ has been investigated, little is known about how age-dependent changes on HG secretion affect RJ composition and their biological consequences. In this study, we identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during HG development by using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling technique. This proteomic method increases the potential for new protein discovery by improving the identification of low quantity proteins. RESULTS: A total of 1282 proteins were identified from five age groups of worker bees, 284 of which were differentially expressed. 43 (15.1%) of the DEPs were identified for the first time. Comparison of samples at day 6, 9, 12, and 16 of development relative to day 3 led to the unambiguous identification of 112, 117, 127, and 127 DEPs, respectively. The majority of these DEPs were up-regulated in the older worker groups, indicating a substantial change in the pattern of proteins expressed after 3 days. DEPs were identified among all the age groups, suggesting that changes in protein expression during HG ontogeny are concomitant with different states of worker development. A total of 649 proteins were mapped to canonical signaling pathways found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), which were preferentially associated with metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. More than 10 key high-abundance proteins were involved in signaling pathways related to ribosome function and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results were validated by qPCR. CONCLUSION: Our approach demonstrates that HG experienced important changes in protein expression during its ontogenic development, which supports the secretion of proteins involved in diverse functions in adult workers beyond its traditional role in royal jelly production.

Two large hospitals performed a respiratory Taqman array card (TAC), targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria, and 2 fungi simultaneously, on 435 samples from 397 symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Clinical details were collected retrospectively using a structured case report form. An overall positivity rate of 68% was found (51% mono- and 17% co-infections). Pathogen distribution was as follows: influenza A (20.7%), rhinoviruses (15.2%), coronaviruses (7.8%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (7.4%), RSV (7.1%), and CMV (6.0%) were the most frequently encountered, followed by HSV (5.5%), hMPV (4.4%), parainfluenza viruses (3.9%), influenza B (3.7%), and Aspergillus species (3.7%). Other pathogens were not detected or detected only in \u2264 1% of samples. Hospital and ICU admission rates were 84% and 11%, respectively. The presence of a pathogen was strongly associated with higher need for supplemental oxygen (p = 0.001), but it had no impact on ICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirement, antibacterial therapy, or mortality. In conclusion, our study described the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in a large group of symptomatic immunocompromised patients and provides evidence of a relationship between pathogen detection and the need for supplemental oxygen. This association was still found after the exclusion of the results positive for influenza viruses, suggesting that non-influenza viruses contribute to severe respiratory illness in patients with compromised immunity.","publish_time":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steensels, Deborah; Reynders, Marijke; Descheemaeker, Patrick; Curran, Martin D.; Hites, Maya; Etienne, Isabelle; Montesinos, Isabel","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/605d6674612c1b973be0af1592fa6b1663bad329.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087587.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-019-03579-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111372/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV","HSV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of respiratory viruses","non-influenza viruses","epidemiology of respiratory pathogens","parainfluenza viruses","immunocompromised adult patients","influenza B","large group of symptomatic immunocompromised patients","severe respiratory illness","potential clinical impact of respiratory viral infections","respiratory Taqman array card","pathogen detection","supplemental oxygen","clinical outcomes","Clinical details","Pathogen distribution","association","samples","ICU admission rates","large hospitals","higher need","co-infections","mechanical ventilation requirement","evidence","antibacterial therapy","TAC","relationship","high-risk patient population","compromised immunity","exclusion","results positive","study","structured case report form","mortality","coronaviruses","Pneumocystis jirovecii","hMPV","overall positivity rate","fungi","mono","conclusion","Aspergillus species","rhinoviruses","RSV","HSV","goal","presence","CMV"],"language":"en"},

Pregnant heifers were stratified by heifer development system, initial BW, and AI service sire and placed in an individual feeding system. Heifers were offered meadow hay (8 to 11% CP) from early November to mid-February and provided no supplement (CON; n = 37), 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried distillers grains with solubles\u2013based supplement (HI; n = 39), or 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried corn gluten feed\u2013based supplement (LO; n = 38). Supplements were designed to be isonitrogenous (28% CP) and isocaloric but to differ in RUP with HI (59% RUP) having greater levels of RUP than LO (34% RUP). After the individual feeding period, heifers were placed in a drylot for calving. All heifers were bred using a fixed-timed AI protocol and pairs were moved to a commercial ranch in the Nebraska Sandhills for summer grazing. Calf weaning BW did not differ (P = 0.14) based on maternal diet. However, feedlot entry BW was greater (P = 0.03) for HI compared with CON calves. Average daily gain during the initial feedlot phase tended (P = 0.10) to be greatest for calves born to CON dams and lowest for calves born to LO dams. However, overall ADG was similar (P = 0.50) for the entire feedlot period. Residual feed intake during the reimplant and total feeding period was improved in calves born to supplemented dams in yr 2 and 3 compared with calves born to CON dams. There was no difference in final BW among treatments (P = 0.71). Hot carcass weight was similar (P = 0.72) among treatments; however, steers had greater (P \u003C 0.01) HCW than heifers. Furthermore, percent empty body fat and 12th rib fat thickness were lowest (P = 0.05 and P = 0.04) for calves born to LO dams. Tenderness measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force was increased (P = 0.03) in longissimus samples from calves from CON dams compared to calves from LO dams. Similarly, crude fat levels tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for calves from CON dams compared with calves from LO dams. Based on these data, providing RUP supplements, similar to those used in this study, to primiparous heifers in late gestation consuming ad libitum grass hay resulted in increased initial feedlot BW for HI compared to CON calves, improved feed efficiency, and altered carcass characteristics in calves born to supplemented compared with CON dams.","publish_time":"2015-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Summers, A.

In spite of several outbreaks in the very recent years, no vaccine against this deadly virus is developed yet. In this study, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV was analyzed through Computational Immunology approach to identify the antigenic determinants (epitopes). In order to do so, the sequences of S glycoprotein that belong to different geographical regions were aligned to observe the conservancy of MERS-CoV RBD. The immune parameters of this region were determined using different in silico tools and Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Molecular docking study was also employed to check the affinity of the potential epitope towards the binding cleft of the specific HLA allele. The N-terminus RBD (S367-S606) of S glycoprotein was found to be conserved among all the available strains of MERS-CoV. Based on the lower IC(50) value, a total of eight potential T-cell epitopes and 19 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I alleles were identified for this conserved region. A 9-mer epitope CYSSLILDY displayed interactions with the maximum number of MHC class-I molecules and projected the highest peak in the B-cell antigenicity plot which concludes that it could be a better choice for designing an epitope based peptide vaccine against MERSCoV considering that it must undergo further in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, in molecular docking study, this epitope was found to have a significant binding affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol towards the binding cleft of the HLA-C*12:03 molecule.","publish_time":"2014-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"ali, Mohammad Tuhin; Morshed, Mohammed Monzur; Gazi, Md.

The sequence of papaya ringspot viral HC-Pro was compared with respect to both inter and intea-species across different potyviruses. This study suggested that highly conserved domains involved in post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) suppression and proteolytic activity are essential functions in plant-virus cycle. In contrast, mechanisms primed for differentiation such as host specificity and virus replication are less conserved.

Symptoms are nonspecific and may affect multiple organs, including the central nervous system. Neuroimaging findings have been described in case reports and small series; body imaging findings have not been described extensively. OBJECTIVE: To summarize findings of the most frequently performed imaging studies of the brain, chest and abdomen in patients with HLH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of chest radiographs and CT, abdominal ultrasound and CT, brain CT and MRI, skeletal surveys, and autopsy data. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were diagnosed and treated for HLH at our institution over an 11-year period; 15 patients (60%) died. Common chest radiograph findings included alveolar-interstitial opacities with pleural effusions, often with rapid evolution and resolution. Hepatosplenomegaly, gallbladder wall thickening, hyperechoic kidneys and ascites were common abdominal findings, which resolved after therapy in some cases. Brain-imaging studies revealed nonspecific periventricular white-matter abnormalities, brain-volume loss and enlargement of extra-axial fluid spaces. Three infant cases, one with intracranial hemorrhage, one with multiple pathologic rib fractures and one with diaphyseal periosteal reaction involving multiple long bones on skeletal survey, raised suspicion of child abuse at presentation. Abuse was not substantiated in any case. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the radiographic manifestations of HLH, which are nonspecific and overlap with infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Findings in the chest (similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome) and abdomen may progress rapidly and then regress with institution of appropriate anti-HLH therapy. CNS findings may be progressive. In some infants, initial imaging findings may mimic nonaccidental trauma.","publish_time":"2003-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fitzgerald, Nancy E.; MacClain, Kenneth L.","journal":"Pediatr Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36b5fe3a39ccc2a0da02f69593d85c28ec594f89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100656.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100656/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLH","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS findings","Neuroimaging findings","body imaging findings","initial imaging findings","common abdominal findings","Common chest radiograph findings","brain CT","Brain-imaging studies","patients","radiographic manifestations of HLH","institution of appropriate anti-HLH therapy","brain-volume loss","multiple organs","abdomen","Retrospective review of chest radiographs","multiple long bones","abdominal ultrasound","skeletal surveys","multiple pathologic rib fractures","case reports","infant cases","nonspecific periventricular white-matter abnormalities","diminished immune surveillance","suspicion of child abuse","nonmalignant disorder of immune regulation","hyperechoic kidneys","diaphyseal periosteal reaction","alveolar-interstitial opacities","ascites","overproduction of cytokines","pleural effusions","small series","MRI","gallbladder wall thickening","acute respiratory distress syndrome","enlargement of extra-axial fluid spaces","intracranial hemorrhage","METHODS","radiologists","rapid evolution","Hepatosplenomegaly","nonaccidental trauma","central nervous system","autopsy data","Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","Clinicians","neoplastic disorders","MATERIALS","presentation","BACKGROUND","year period","infants","CONCLUSIONS","resolution","Symptoms","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Periodic resurgences in invasive group A streptococcal infections in industrialized countries have been reported from the 1980s onwards, with current estimates of incidence in these countries of approximately 3\u20134 per 100000 population. Infants, pregnant women and the elderly are at increased risk of invasive group A streptococcal infection. The group A streptococcus has an array of virulence factors that underpin its invasive capacity and, in approximately 10% of cases, super-antigen toxins produced by the bacteria stimulate a large proportion of T cells, leading to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Given the rapid clinical progression, effective management of invasive group A streptococcal infections hinges on early recognition of the disease and prompt initiation of supportive care (often intensive care) together with antibacterial therapy. In cases of toxic shock syndrome, it is often difficult to distinguish between streptococcal and staphylococcal infection before cultures become available and so antibacterial choice must include coverage of both of these organisms. In addition, clindamycin is an important adjunctive antibacterial because of its anti-toxin effects and excellent tissue penetration. Early institution of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy should be considered in cases of toxic shock syndrome and severe invasive infection, including necrotizing fasciitis. Early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is also an important part of management in cases of necrotizing fasciitis.","publish_time":"2012-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steer, Andrew C.; Lamagni, Theresa; Curtis, Nigel; Carapetis, Jonathan R.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0b143517a295247472accdf733f36ffa63bfb99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["streptococcal infections","streptococcal toxic shock syndrome","effective management of invasive group","invasive capacity","severe invasive infection","increased risk of invasive group","cases of toxic shock syndrome","cases of necrotizing fasciitis","antibacterial therapy","early recognition","staphylococcal infection","antibacterial choice","Early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue","Early institution of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy","intensive care","industrialized countries","excellent tissue penetration","prompt initiation of supportive care","anti-toxin effects","elderly","disease","cultures","large proportion of T cells","rapid clinical progression","high case fatality rates","array of virulence factors","Periodic resurgences","super-antigen toxins","streptococcus","clindamycin","current estimates of incidence","pregnant women","Infants","addition","coverage","organisms","population"],"language":"en"},

Even in developed countries, the occurrence of spontaneous air-leaks and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) still represent the most severe clinical presentation in early childhood, with a high fatality rate. A clinical series review from a tertiary university paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was undertaken. During the 2006\u20132007 outbreak in Rome, Italy, a young infant presented with ARDS/spontaneous air-leak and needed aggressive ventilatory management and haemodynamic support. Both nebulised iloprost and intravenous pentoxifylline were administered during the acute hypoxaemic phase; the role of this pharmacologic approach in critically ill patients is still under debate. We observed four further cases of respiratory impairment requiring a non-invasive approach. Clinical-radiological findings ranged from interstitial pneumonia to bronchiolitis-like pictures. All patients were imported cases, representing an important epidemiological factor and future medical issue, though they were not malnourished nor affected by chronic diseases. We conclude that early respiratory assessment and timely PICU referral is of mainstem importance in the youngest infants with measles-induced respiratory failure. The protean nature of clinical presentation and the possibility of rapid respiratory deterioration should be highlighted, and infants from immigrant families may represent a susceptible high-risk group.","publish_time":"2009-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piastra, M.; Onesimo, R.; De Luca, D.; Lancella, L.; Marzano, L.; De Rosa, G.; Pietrini, D.; Valentini, P.; Conti, G.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67a1cdb1747e03b6b94aa6336db31c089a1dbfba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101534/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rome"],"keyphrases":["respiratory support","respiratory failure","early respiratory assessment","cases of respiratory impairment","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Young infants","severe clinical presentation","possibility of rapid respiratory deterioration","ARDS","measles","clinical series review","youngest infants","Clinical-radiological findings","protean nature of clinical presentation","occurrence of spontaneous air-leaks","early childhood","haemodynamic support","pharmacologic approach","non-invasive approach","ill patients","timely PICU referral","acute hypoxaemic phase","tertiary university paediatric intensive care unit","mainstem importance","significant risk","important epidemiological factor","aggressive ventilatory management","interstitial pneumonia","future medical issue","death","role","immigrant families","bronchiolitis","long-term complications","Italy","susceptible high-risk group","high fatality rate","intravenous pentoxifylline","developed countries","pictures","outbreak","debate","chronic diseases"],"language":"en"},

Typical acute lung injury was induced in rats by 60 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion in isolated and perfused rat lung model. Rat lungs were randomly assigned to receive PBS (control), 1 % FC-77, IR only, or IR with different doses of FC-77 (0.1 %, 0.5 %, or 1 %). Subsequently, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), perfusate, and lung tissues were collected to evaluate the degree of lung injury. IR caused a significant increase in the following parameters: pulmonary arterial pressure, capillary filtration coefficient, lung weight gain, lung weight/body weight ratio, wet/dry lung weight ratio, and protein concentration in BALF. TNF-\u03B1 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 concentrations in perfusate samples and MDA concentration and MPO activities in lung tissues were also significantly increased. Histopathology showed increased septal thickness and neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissues. Furthermore, NF-\u03BAB activity was significantly increased in the lungs. However, pretreatment with 1 % FC-77 prior to IR significantly attenuated the increases in these parameters. In conclusion, our results suggest that systemic FC-77 administration had a protective effect on IR-induced acute lung injury. These protective mechanisms may have been mediated by the inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activation and attenuation of subsequent inflammatory response.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Shi-Jye; Huang, Kun-Lun; Wu, Shu-Yu; Ko, Fu-Chang; Wu, Geng-Chin; Li, Rui-Ying; Li, Min-Hui","journal":"Inflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7cea71441bd253d097fa43e2a8aeb3797805231.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS","MDA","IR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung tissues","induced lung injury","degree of lung injury","lung weight gain","Typical acute lung injury","dry lung weight ratio","perfused rat lung model","systemic FC","body weight ratio","reperfusion","BALF","ischemia","different doses of FC","Rat lungs","Systemic administration of perfluorocarbons","NF-\u03BAB activity","increased septal thickness","MDA concentration","perfusate samples","protein concentration","neutrophil infiltration","\u03BAB activation","following parameters","effects of PFCs","protective effect","inhibition of NF","protective mechanisms","capillary filtration coefficient","pulmonary arterial pressure","acid aspiration","MPO activities","concentrations","attenuation of subsequent inflammatory response","significant increase","phorbol myristate acetate","cytokine","Histopathology","rats","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","TNF-\u03B1","results","PBS","conclusion","control","increases","pretreatment"],"language":"en"},

Sixty male Wistar rats were randomized into sham-operated group (group A, n=10), AHNP group (group B, n=10), L-arginine-treated group (group C, n=10), L-N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NAME)-treated group (group D, n=10), CQ-treated group (group E, n=10) and CQ\u002BL-NAME-treated group (group F, n=10). TLR4 expression was measured by using real time-PCR and Western blotting respectively. The results showed that, in the group B, the expression of TLR4 and the levels of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6 in the lungs were significantly increased, and the nitric oxide (NO) concentration was reduced, as compared with those in the group A (P\u003C0.05 or P\u003C0.01). Lung injury was aggravated with the increased expression of TLR4. When the inhibitor and stimulator of TLR4, namely L-Arg and L-NAME, were added respectively, lung injury was correspondingly relieved or aggravated (P\u003C0.05 or P\u003C0.01). In the group E, TLR4 expression was substantially lower and NO concentration higher than those in the group B (P\u003C0.05 or P\u003C0.01). However, in the group F, NO concentration was markedly decreased, and the inhibitory effect of CQ on TLR4 expression and the relief of lung injury were weakened when compared with those in the group E (P\u003C0.05 or P\u003C0.01). It was concluded that TLR4 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of ALI complicated in AHNP. CQ could relieve ALI by decreasing the TLR4 expression and increasing the NO release.","publish_time":"2013-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lei; Chen, Yan; Wang, Lin; Chen, Xiao-ping; Zhang, Wan-guang; Wang, Chun-you; Wu, He-shui","journal":"J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d5467d7853fce9ef9948bc008aee18f526b656e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHNP","CQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group E","AHNP group","group B","group F","group C","group D","CQ-treated group","arginine-treated group","TLR4 expression","sham-operated group","increased expression of TLR4","stimulator of TLR4","N-nitro","acute lung injury","relief of lung injury","inhibitory effect of CQ","development of ALI","concentration higher","arginine methyl ester","acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis","real time-PCR","levels of TNF","IL","Western blotting","pathogenesis","important role","chloroquine","male Wistar rats","mechanism","nitric oxide","release","study","lungs","results"],"language":"en"},

Acacetin, a natural flavonoid compound, has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects which can potentially work to reduce sepsis. We investigated the potential protective effect of acacetin on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) ALI and dissect out the underlying mechanisms. Mice were divided into five groups: a sham group, a sepsis-induced ALI group, and three sepsis groups pre-treated with 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg body weight of acacetin. We found that acacetin significantly attenuated sepsis-induced ALI, in histological examinations and lung edema. Additionally, acacetin treatment decreased protein and inflammatory cytokine concentration and the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells in BALF compared with that in the non-treated sepsis mice. Pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was lower in the acacetin-pre-treated sepsis groups than in the sepsis group. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of acacetin on sepsis is related to the regulation of certain antioxidation genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), superoxide dismutases (SODs), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1).Taken together, our results indicate that acacetin pre-treatment inhibits sepsis-induced ALI through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity, suggesting that acacetin may be a potential protective agent for sepsis-induced ALI.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Li-Chao; Zhang, Hong-Bo; Gu, Cheng-Dong; Guo, Shi-Dong; Li, Gang; Lian, Rui; Yao, Yao; Zhang, Guo-Qiang","journal":"Arch Pharm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ca03fdbe0b401bc733ab4800866d2c974d65c2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101724.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101724/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sepsis-induced ALI group","attenuated sepsis-induced ALI","acacetin-pre-treated sepsis groups","acacetin treatment","acacetin pre-treatment","potential protective effect of acacetin","non-treated sepsis mice","body weight of acacetin","potential protective agent","sham group","antioxidative activity","lung edema","anti-inflammatory effects","underlying mechanisms","inflammatory cytokine concentration","acute lung injury","number of infiltrated inflammatory cells","inducible nitric oxide synthase","regulation of certain antioxidation genes","natural flavonoid compound","histological examinations","iNOS","BALF","protein","clinical syndrome","SODs","cyclooxygenase","heme oxygenase","superoxide dismutases","Pulmonary myeloperoxidase","therapeutic treatments","COX","results","HO"],"language":"en"},

This powerful science is now teaching us about the genetic diversity in both susceptibility and outcome of disease, and the diversity in life experiences and antigen exposures. Clinicians have tried to lump together and treat in a similar way many diverse human diseases. This has not worked well. Pancreatitis and perforated diverticulitis both produce inflammation and sepsis, but they are different processes and may both lead to multiple organ failure. This lumping together has contributed to the failure of so-called magic bullets. There are new contributors to organ damage.

Proinflammatory mediators released by damaged liver after liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury might contribute to this form of ALI, but the underlying mechanisms have not been well characterized. High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), a recently identified proinflammatory cytokine, was found to be significantly higher in the serum after liver I/R injury. This study investigated whether HMGB1 was involved as a stimulating factor, and whether its downstream Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways act as mediators in the development of liver I/R injury-induced ALI. Extensive ALI and lung inflammation was induced in a rat model of liver I/R injury. Serum HMGB1 was significantly higher after liver I/R injury, and more importantly, expression of HMGB1 mRNA and protein in the lung tissue was also significantly increased. We further found that liver I/R injury enhanced the expression of TLR4 mRNA and protein, and the activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. Inhibition of TLR4 expression in the lung tissue by infection with pGCSIL-GFP-lentivirus-expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting the TLR4 gene (TLR4-shRNA lentivirus) significantly attenuated ALI, lung inflammation, and activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. These findings indicate that HMGB1 might contribute to the underlying mechanism for liver I/R injury-induced ALI and that its downstream TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways are potentially important mediators in the development of ALI.","publish_time":"2013-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Zhongwei; Deng, Yuxiao; Su, Diansan; Tian, Jie; Gao, Yuan; He, Zhengyu; Wang, Xiangrui","journal":"Lab Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14ba799e26f7fa6fa565077f2f4f8fa287378306.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101938.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R injury-induced ALI","development of liver","damaged liver","liver transplantation","liver ischemia","lung tissue","Acute lung injury","lung inflammation","development of ALI","downstream TLR4","rat model of liver","major liver surgery","attenuated ALI","Extensive ALI","form of ALI","expression of TLR4 mRNA","TLR4 gene","Serum HMGB1","Inhibition of TLR4 expression","expression of HMGB1 mRNA","TLR4-shRNA lentivirus","activator protein","activity of p38MAPK","Proinflammatory mediators","important mediators","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","High-mobility group box protein","downstream Toll","pathways act","underlying mechanisms","proinflammatory cytokine","small hairpin RNAs","infection","reperfusion","pGCSIL-GFP","receptor","stimulating factor","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Natural killer cells assume a central role in the non-specific immunological response in tumor patients. Their main function is the destruction of tumor cells via cytotoxic activities amplified by the release of interleukin-2 and TNF-\u03B1. Natural killer cell activity was measured prior to surgery and on postoperative days 4 and 10 using a standardized europium chloride release assay, utilizing K 562 target cells. Lymphokines interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and THF-\u03B1 were also measured on postoperative days 1 and 7 using standardized ELISA assays. The activity of natural killer cells in our patient group sank significantly (P\u003C0.05) on postoperative day 4 and likewise in the control group and both study groups, activity sank to the original values. In the control groups, natural killer cell activity averaged 45% of preoperative values, in comparison with an average of 63% following transmediastinal esophageal carcinoma resection (one cavity procedure), and transthoracic en bloc resection patients only reached 61% of preoperative values, transmediastinal dissection patients assumed 75%, and 77% was achieved by control group members. Transthoracic en bloc resection of the esophagus led to a more extreme reduction in cytotoxic cellular activity owing to the greater surgical trauma. Suppression of the immunological tumor resistance, especially in the vulnerable perisurgical pahse, can have an indirect negative effect on the manifestation risk of hematogenic metastases owing to intraoperative tumor cell dissemination resulting from tumor manipulation and may thus be prognostically relevant.","publish_time":"1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bruns, Ch.; Sch\u00E4fer, H.; Wolfgarten, B.; Pichlmaier, H.","journal":"Langenbecks Arch Chir","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e65427dff8a5312e0c4d89211478368a15af7cfb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of natural killer cells","Natural killer cell activity","tumor patients","destruction of tumor cells","cytotoxic cellular activity","transthoracic en bloc resection patients","tumor manipulation","transmediastinal esophageal carcinoma resection","transmediastinal dissection patients","control group of thoracic","control groups","target cells","preoperative values","control group members","release of interleukin","cases of transthioracic en bloc esophageal resection","immunological tumor resistance","abdominal surgical patients","intraoperative tumor cell dissemination","patient group","original values","Lymphokines interleukin","postoperative days","TNF-\u03B1","cases of transmediastinal dissection","therapy of esophageal carcinoma","study groups","greater surgical trauma","impact of surgical trauma","THF-\u03B1","perspective study","cytotoxic activities","standardized europium chloride release assay","cellular immune system","non-specific immunological response","standardized ELISA assays","manifestation risk of hematogenic metastases","central role","cavity procedure","esophagus","indirect negative effect","extreme reduction","serum concentrations of interleuin","surgery","non-malignant maladies","vulnerable perisurgical pahse","average","perioperative hematological parameters","main function","comparison","Suppression","order"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all infections caused by S. maltophilia in HSCT recipients in a single center in Israel during a 4 year period. RESULTS: Of 570 patients undergoing HSCT, 19 patients with an invasive S. maltophilia infection were identified. Sixteen had allogeneic HSCT and 3 had autologous HSCT. Seventeen patients (90%) had an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) at the time of infection. S. maltophilia infections were detected in three clinical settings: as a complication of prolonged neutropenia (n = 9), as a CVC-related non-neutropenic infection occurring after CVC manipulation (n = 8) and as a respiratory tract infection (n = 2). Eleven patients (58%) had a polymicrobial infection. Ten patients (52.6%) received carbapenems during the previous month. The treatment for all patients included broad spectrum antibiotics, which were switched according to susceptibilities upon identification of the isolates. All isolates were susceptible in vitro to TMP-SMX. CVCs were removed in 12 patients (70%). Six patients, all after allogeneic HSCT, died. The CVC was removed in only two of the five patients with CVCs who died. CONCLUSIONS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in HSCT recipients, both in the early neutropenic phase and in the non-neutropenic phase. It is commonly associated with the presence and manipulation of an indwelling CVC. Removal of the CVC in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy (TMP-SMX) is crucial for infection control.","publish_time":"2010-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeshurun, M.; Gafter-Gvili, A.; Thaler, M.; Keller, N.; Nagler, A.; Shimoni, A.","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15a476a5530b04bce15b8bb652866b6729955e6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102005/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","CVC"],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["patients","HSCT recipients","allogeneic HSCT","neutropenic infection","autologous HSCT","indwelling CVC","CVC manipulation","maltophilia infections","CVC-related","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","infection control","time of infection","polymicrobial infection","respiratory tract infection","non-neutropenic phase","TMP-SMX","early neutropenic phase","isolates","CVCs","Recipients of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation","indwelling central venous catheter","emerging nosocomial pathogen","addition","appropriate antibiotic therapy","Israel","single center","high risk","complication of prolonged neutropenia","clinical settings","broad spectrum antibiotics","retrospective analysis","BACKGROUND","carbapenems","treatment","CONCLUSIONS","presence","year period","previous month","METHODS","susceptibilities","identification","Removal","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2002 in the Section of Radiology I of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy), 11 patients with transplanted bowel were studied with different methods: traditional radiologic evaluation with contrast agent (all patients), evaluation of transit time with radiopaque markers (five patients), ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the intestinal wall and Doppler US of the vascular axes (five patients), computed tomographic (CT) evaluation (all patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the bowel and the vascular axes (five patients). Traditional contrast examination enabled evaluation of the gastroesophageal transit and cardia functionality; anatomy and integrity of the anastomoses (proximal and distal); time of gastric emptying; morphology, tone, and kinesis of the transplanted small bowel loops and time of global transit. The study of transit with radiopaque markers was carried out in five patients to define the time of transit through the entire transplanted bowel, confirm recovery of intestinal motility, and identify possible abnormalities. The US examination was carried out in five patients to evaluate the morphology, thickness, and echo structural features of the intestinal loops. Color Doppler was performed to visualize the superior mesenteric artery and a wall arteriole of the sampled loop. CT examination was performed 2 to 4 weeks after surgery to evaluate the anatomy of the transplanted organs, arterial and venous anastomoses in case of complications identified with other methods or suspected, and periodically in the follow-up of patients who underwent transplantation due to Gardner syndrome. The protocol for MR evaluation of the bowel included coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, axial and/or sagittal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, coronal fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMP- SPGR) sequences, coronal FMPSPGR sequences with and without administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast agent, and axial or sagittal FMPSPGR fat-saturated sequences performed after dynamic gadolinium administration. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study of transit with radiopaque markers was useful in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction because it identified recovery and normalization of motility. Traditional contrast examination of the gastrointestinal tract continues to play an important role in transplanted patients because it is a simple examination that allows evaluation of the graft anatomy and recovery of motility of the residual native bowel and the transplanted loops. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in early detection of major postoperative complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, fistulas, and anastomotic complications (stenosis and dehiscence). CT examination is crucial for the detection of fluid collections, abscesses, and fistulas because it can serve as a guide of drainage and during follow-up of patients with Gardner syndrome can be used to investigate all possible sites in which desmoids might arise in addition to their relation to the graft. Because patients with transplanted bowel are generally rather a young population of reproductive age and because of technologic advances, MR may represent an effective method that does not use ionizing radiation and can therefore substitute for traditional radiologic evaluation. US represents a quick examination technique that is easily available and well tolerated by patients, and it has a role to play in the follow-up of transplanted patients and in the identification of major postoperative complications. However, its role in monitoring possible rejection remains to be defined with studies on wider and more representative samples.","publish_time":"2005-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pecchi, A.; De Santis, M.; Torricelli, P.; Romagnoli, R.; Francesco, F. di; Cautero, N.; Pinna, A.","journal":"Abdom Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf4e84f5fece446085460d21fc87c1364c2b16ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102087.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPGR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["follow-up of transplanted patients","follow-up of patients","evaluation of transit time","MR evaluation","entire transplanted bowel","transplanted loops","traditional radiologic evaluation","US examination","transplanted small bowel loops","time of transit","transplanted organs","Traditional contrast examination","CT examination","intestinal loops","study of transit","simple examination","recovery of intestinal motility","time of global transit","intestinal wall","intestinal obstruction","gastroesophageal transit","coronal FMPSPGR sequences","residual native bowel","fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences","recovery of motility","radiopaque markers","crucial role","quick examination technique","Doppler US","anastomotic complications","case of complications","graft anatomy","important role","chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction","identification of major postoperative complications","sagittal FMPSPGR fat-saturated sequences","early detection of major postoperative complications","coronal fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo","administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast agent","time of gastric emptying","fistulas","morphology","normalization of motility","vascular axes","different methods","possible abnormalities","Gardner syndrome","possible sites","monitoring possible rejection","wall arteriole","venous anastomoses","University of Modena","Color Doppler","detection of fluid collections","dynamic gadolinium administration","FMP- SPGR","kinesis","perforation","cardia functionality","gastrointestinal tract","young population of reproductive age","technologic advances","Reggio Emilia","integrity","tone","Italy","structural features","superior mesenteric artery","studies","effective method","abscesses","stenosis","thickness","transplantation","magnetic resonance","ultrasonographic","techniques","representative samples","ionizing radiation","addition","sampled loop","desmoids","dehiscence","CONCLUSION","weeks","protocol","Section of Radiology","guide of drainage","indications","times","relation","RESULTS","surgery","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Cryoprecipitate, which can supply fibrinogen and other coagulation factors, is widely used in OLT. However, the effects of intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion on ARF following OLT remain unclear. METHODS: In a series of 389 adult patients who received grafts from deceased donors and underwent their first OLT, the clinical correlation between intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and ARF following OLT was retrospectively studied after adjusting for potential confounders. The distribution of ARF and the causes of death within the first year after OLT were also compared separately in patients with and without cryoprecipitate transfusion. RESULTS: The incidence of ARF in patients with cryoprecipitate transfusion was significantly higher than in patients without cryoprecipitate transfusion (15.9 vs. 7.8 %, p = 0.012). A nonlinear relationship between intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and ARF following OLT was observed. The risk of ARF increased with the cryoprecipitate transfusion level up to the turning point (16 U) (adjusted OR 1.1, 95 % CI 1.1\u20131.2; p \u003C 0.001). When the cryoprecipitate level exceeded 16 U, the level of cryoprecipitate transfusion was not associated with the risk of ARF (OR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.85\u20131.1; p = 0.319). Deaths within the first year after the operation occurred more frequently in cases with cryoprecipitate transfusion (22.9 vs. 14.2 %, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion is associated with ARF following OLT. Cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT should be performed carefully until more convincing evidence has been found.","publish_time":"2013-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shuang; Wang, Xiaoliang; Lu, Yuanshan; Li, Tao; Gong, Zijun; Sheng, Tao; Hu, Bin; Peng, Zhihai; Sun, Xing","journal":"Hepatol Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34b251a0535f1c862315d7ee8155d1a9eab40f24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARF","OLT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cryoprecipitate transfusion level","level of cryoprecipitate transfusion","OLT","cryoprecipitate level","effects of intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion","risk of ARF","incidence of ARF","distribution of ARF","adult patients","definition of risk factors","year","coagulation factors","acute renal failure","orthotropic liver transplantation","clinical correlation","deceased donors","turning point","nonlinear relationship","grafts","causes of death","findings","series","PURPOSE","fibrinogen","cases","operation","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","potential confounders","convincing evidence","METHODS","Deaths"],"language":"en"},

Fifty-eight cases of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome were reported in previously healthy persons, with an incidence of 14.4 cases per million per year in youngsters aged 15\u201324 years old.

Patients often had metastatic infections already on admission and needed prolonged hospitalisation. The overall mortality of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome was 9%. Forty-two elderly patients had disseminated F. necrophorum infections originating from foci in lower parts of the body.

This study shows that the incidence of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome is higher than that previously found and has a characteristic age distribution. Early suspicion of the diagnosis, several weeks of antibiotic therapy, often combined with surgical drainage, is mandatory to lower the mortality.

Many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases use JAKs and STATs to transduce intracellular signals. Mutations in JAK and STAT genes cause a number of immunodeficiency syndromes, and polymorphisms in these genes are associated with autoimmune diseases. The success of small-molecule JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) in the treatment of rheumatologic disease demonstrates that intracellular signaling pathways can be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity. Tofacitinib, the first rheumatologic Jakinib, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for rheumatoid arthritis and is currently under investigation for other autoimmune diseases. Many other Jakinibs are in preclinical development or in various phases of clinical trials. This review describes the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, outlines its role in autoimmunity, and explains the rationale/pre-clinical evidence for targeting JAK\u2013STAT signaling. The safety and clinical efficacy of the Jakinibs are reviewed, starting with the FDA-approved Jakinib tofacitinib, and continuing on to next-generation Jakinibs.

METHODS: All children (0\u201312 y of age) diagnosed and confirmed as dengue fever at a tertiary care hospital at Puducherry, between the 1st of August 2012 and January 31st 2015 were reviewed retrospectively from hospital case records as per the revised World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 2011 for dengue fever. The diagnosis was confirmed by NS1 antigen-based ELISA test or dengue serology for IgM and IgG antibodies and the data was analyzed using SPSS 16.0 statistical software. RESULTS: Out of 254 children admitted with dengue fever, non-severe dengue and severe dengue were seen in 62.6 % and 37.4 % respectively. Atypical manifestations were seen in 106 cases (41.7 %). Mean age of presentation was 6.9(3.3) y. M: F ratio was 1.2:1. The common manifestations of severe dengue infection were shock (37.4 %), bleeding (20.1 %) and multi-organ dysfunction (2.4 %). The most common atypical manifestations of dengue fever were lymphadenopathy (41.7 %), splenomegaly (21.2 %), biphasic fever (18.1 %), hepatitis (11.4 %), febrile diarrhea (6.3 %), refractory shock (2.4 %) and impaired consciousness (1.9 %). The other atypical manifestations present were portal hypertension, acalculous cholecystitis, appendicitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis, pericardial effusion, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), myositis, acute kidney injury (AKI), hemophagocytic syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Platelet count did not always correlate well with the severity of bleeding. There were six deaths (2.4 %) and out of them four presented with impaired consciousness (66.6 %). The common causes for poor outcome were multiorgan failure, encephalopathy and refractory shock. CONCLUSIONS: The atypical manifestations of dengue fever are no more a rare entity. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and vigilance for atypical manifestations of dengue fever as lack of timely detection and management could be fatal. Impaired consciousness was the most ominous atypical manifestation of severe dengue infection.","publish_time":"2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pothapregada, Sriram; Kamalakannan, Banupriya; Thulasingam, Mahalakshmy","journal":"Indian J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa27b604c925d479006c8d4dfb83442a700a01b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Puducherry"],"keyphrases":["common atypical manifestations of dengue fever","dengue serology","non-severe dengue","common manifestations of severe dengue infection","atypical manifestations present","ominous atypical manifestation of severe dengue infection","biphasic fever","children","impaired consciousness","refractory shock","common causes","acute respiratory distress syndrome","hemophagocytic syndrome","poor outcome","y of age","severity of bleeding","acute kidney injury","tertiary care hospital","hospital case records","Mean age of presentation","appendicitis","acalculous cholecystitis","multiorgan failure","PSVT","myositis","myocarditis","ARDS","IgM","portal hypertension","vigilance","pericardial effusion","paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia","NS1 antigen-based ELISA test","lack of timely detection","AKI","encephalopathy","revised World Health Organization","data","IgG antibodies","guidelines","high index of suspicion","lymphadenopathy","clinical profile","management","intravascular coagulopathy","SPSS","Puducherry","CONCLUSIONS","statistical software","multi-organ dysfunction","rare entity","Clinicians","splenomegaly","OBJECTIVES","diagnosis","febrile diarrhea","hepatitis","cases","F ratio","Platelet count","RESULTS","METHODS","deaths"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS: Pulmonary capillaritis likely contributes to the pathogenesis, however is only observed in half of the biopsies. Corticosteroids induce remission in the majority of patients, however almost half recur and require a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive to maintain remission. Cyclophosphamide- or rituximab-based regimens achieve the highest remission rates (50%); other strategies include intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, mycophenolate mofetil, and/or azathioprine.

Picornavirus infections activate a cytosolic RNA sensor, MDA5, which in turn, induces a type I interferon response, a crucial component of antiviral immunity. Moreover, picornaviruses activate the formation of stress granules (SGs), large aggregates of preassembled mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoprotein particles) to temporarily store these molecules upon cellular stress. Meanwhile, picornaviruses actively suppress these antiviral responses to ensure efficient replication.

Over 170 different virus-encoded IFN-antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described up to now, indicating that most viruses interfere with multiple stages of the IFN response. Although every viral IFN antagonist is unique in its own right, four main mechanisms are employed to circumvent innate immune responses: i) general inhibition of cellular gene expression, and ii) sequestration, iii) proteolytic cleavage or iv) proteasomal degradation of key components of the IFN system. The increasing understanding of how different viral IFN antagonists function has been translated to the generation of viruses with mutant IFN antagonists as potential live vaccine candidates. Moreover, IFN antagonists are attractive targets for inhibition by small-molecule compounds.","publish_time":"2010-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Versteeg, Gijs A.; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo","journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3554428b4b39824859a7986329607a3422131ec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d9a9a04d8da9482eac8e25313fd61cf9f888ad43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2920345.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369527410000706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20538505/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2010.05.009; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2920345?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527410000706","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN circuit","IFN response","IFN system","mutant IFN antagonists","different viral IFN antagonists function","different virus-encoded IFN-antagonists","generation of viruses","distinct viruses","viral infections","innate immune avant-garde","innate immune responses","general inhibition of cellular gene expression","potential live vaccine candidates","critical role","attractive targets","proteasomal degradation of key components","increasing understanding","right","sequestration","proteolytic cleavage","small-molecule compounds","antiviral actions","multiple stages","main mechanisms","induction","interferons"],"language":"en"},

To bridge this gap, 14 commercially available primary antibodies were tested for their suitability to demonstrate immune cell populations on formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of dromedaries, Bactrian camels, llamas, and alpacas in the present study. Out of these, 9 antibodies directed against CD3, CD20, CD79\u03B1, HLA-DR, Iba-1, myeloid/histiocyte antigen, CD204, CD208, and CD68 antigen exhibited distinct immunoreaction patterns to certain camelid immune cell subsets.

Here we examine the structural basis for PLpro\u0027s ubiquitin chain and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) specificity. We present the X-ray crystal structure of PLpro in complex with ubiquitin-aldehyde and model the interaction of PLpro with other ubiquitin-chain and ISG15 substrates. We show that PLpro greatly prefers K48- to K63-linked ubiquitin chains, and ISG15-based substrates to those that are mono-ubiquitinated. We propose that PLpro\u0027s higher affinity for K48-linked ubiquitin chains and ISG15 stems from a bivalent mechanism of binding, where two ubiquitin-like domains prefer to bind in the palm domain of PLpro with the most distal ubiquitin domain interacting with a \u201Cridge\u201D region of the thumb domain. Mutagenesis of residues within this ridge region revealed that these mutants retain viral protease activity and the ability to catalyze hydrolysis of mono-ubiquitin. However, a select number of these mutants have a significantly reduced ability to hydrolyze the substrate ISG15-AMC, or be inhibited by K48-linked diubuiquitin. For these latter residues, we found that PLpro antagonism of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF\u03BAB) signaling pathway is abrogated. This identification of key and unique sites in PLpro required for recognition and processing of diubiquitin and ISG15 versus mono-ubiquitin and protease activity provides new insight into ubiquitin-chain and ISG15 recognition and highlights a role for PLpro DUB and deISGylase activity in antagonism of the innate immune response.","publish_time":"2014-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ratia, Kiira; Kilianski, Andrew; Baez-Santos, Yahira M.; Baker, Susan C.; Mesecar, Andrew","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4031219.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ubiquitin-chain","ubiquitin-aldehyde","PLpro\u0027s ubiquitin chain","PLpro antagonism","PLpro DUB","distal ubiquitin domain","K48-linked ubiquitin chains","ISG15 recognition","interaction of PLpro","ISG15 substrates","K63-linked ubiquitin chains","ISG15 stems","palm domain of PLpro","ISG15-based substrates","substrate ISG15-AMC","X-ray crystal structure of PLpro","chain-enhancer","viral protease activity","K48-linked diubuiquitin","deISGylase activity","ridge region","mutants","hydrolysis of mono","innate immune response","thumb domain","mono-ubiquitinated","reduced ability","Mutagenesis of residues","PLpro\u0027s higher affinity","interferon stimulated gene","nuclear factor kappa-light","SARS-CoV","new insight","molecules","complex","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","role","activated B-cells","unique sites","processing of diubiquitin","bivalent mechanism of binding","structural basis","NF\u03BAB","papain","identification of key","post-translational modification","deISGylating activities","specificity","pathway","domains","number"],"language":"en"},

In this study, label-free proteomics was performed to examine protein expression in tongue sole spleen induced by megalocytivirus at 8 and 12 days post infection (dpi). Compared to uninfected control fish, virus-infected fish displayed 315 up-regulated proteins and 111 down-regulated proteins at 8 dpi, and 48 up-regulated proteins and 43 down-regulated proteins at 12 dpi. The expressions of five differentially expressed proteins were confirmed by Western blot. The differentially expressed proteins were enriched in the pathways and processes associated with innate immune response and viral infection. Interference with the expression of two up-regulated proteins of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), i.e. proteasome assembly chaperone 2 and proteasome maturation protein, significantly reduced viral propagation in fish, whereas overexpression of these two proteins significantly enhanced viral propagation. Consistently, inhibition of the functioning of proteasome significantly impaired viral replication in vivo. This study provided the first global protein profile responsive to megalocytivirus in tongue sole, and revealed an essential role of UPS in viral infection.","publish_time":"2018-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jian; Sun, Li","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35f87b9cc72a9beeb05dc649742ce334db48c854.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102559.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2018.11.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X18304269; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X18304269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulated proteins","viral infection","viral propagation","Megalocytivirus","proteasome maturation protein","farmed fish","functioning of proteasome","protein expression","tongue sole spleen","virus-infected fish","impaired viral replication","proteasome assembly chaperone","ubiquitin proteasome system","uninfected control fish","study","days post infection","global protein profile responsive","DNA virus","essential role of UPS","broad host range","innate immune response","Cynoglossus semilaevis","processes","label-free proteomics","pathways","overexpression","inhibition","Western blot","Interference","expressions"],"language":"en"},

To assess the role of receptors in the limited tissue tropism of enterotropic MHV strains, the permissiveness of MHVR- and mmCGM2-expressing cell lines and peritoneal exudate cells from BALB/c and SJL mice for MHV-RI and MHV-Y replication was determined. MHVR transfected BHK cells were susceptible to infection with both MHV-RI and MHV-Y. Additionally, the anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody CC1 blocked MHV-RI and MHV-Y infection. mmCGM2-transfected BHK cells were susceptible to infection with MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI. Peritoneal exudate cells from BALB/c mice were susceptible to infection with MHV-Y and MHVRI, whereas peritoneal exudate cells from SJL- mice were susceptible to infection with MHV-Y but not MHV-RI.

For example, risk for transmission of zoonotic pathogens from bush-meat hunting is primarily focused on human hygiene and personal protection. However, bush-meat hunting is a complex issue promoting the need for holistic strategies to reduce transmission of zoonotic disease while addressing food security and wildlife conservation issues. Temporal and spatial separation of humans and wildlife, risk communication, and other preventative strategies should allow wildlife and humans to co-exist. Upstream surveillance, vaccination, and other tools to prevent pathogen spillover are also needed. Clear multi-sector outcomes should be defined, and a systems-based approach is needed to develop interventions that reduce risks and balance the needs of humans, wildlife, and the environment.

We aimed to describe the clinical epidemiology and associated risk factors for RVIs among symptomatic preterm infants \u226432 weeks up to 2 years of life. METHODS: We performed a data linkage analysis of clinical and hospital laboratory databases for preterm infants born at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital, Singapore, from 2005 to 2015. RVI episodes during initial admission and subsequent hospital readmissions were included. RESULTS: Of 1854 infants in the study, 270 (14.5%) infants were diagnosed with at least 1 RVI. A total of 285 (85.3%) episodes were diagnosed postdischarge, with the highest risk for RVIs being from 3 to 5 months of age. The incidence of RVI in this population was 116 per 1000 infant-years and respiratory syncytial virus was the main overall causative pathogen. Infants with RVIs were more likely to be born at \u226427 weeks\u2019 gestational age (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2\u20132.3), to have received postnatal steroids (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0\u20132.1), and to be diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2\u20132.4). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of RVIs is high in preterm infants in the tropics, affecting \u003E1 of 10 infants born at \u226432 weeks\u2019 gestation before 2 years of age. Respiratory syncytial virus was the main causative pathogen identified.

The aim of this study was to determine the innate immune mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to frequent exacerbations in COPD. We measured sputum expression of immune mediators and bacterial loads in samples from patients with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbations. Ex vivo immune responses to rhinovirus infection in differentiated bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) sampled from patients with COPD were additionally evaluated. Patients were stratified as frequent exacerbators (\u22652 exacerbations in the preceding year) or infrequent exacerbators (\u003C2 exacerbations in the preceding year) with comparisons made between these groups. Frequent exacerbators had reduced sputum cell mRNA expression of the anti-viral immune mediators type I and III interferons and reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when clinically stable and during virus-associated exacerbation. RV-induction of interferon and ISGs ex vivo was also impaired in differentiated BECs from frequent exacerbators. Frequent exacerbators also had reduced sputum levels of the anti-microbial peptide mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-2 with an associated increase in sputum bacterial loads at 2 weeks following virus-associated exacerbation onset. MBL-2 levels correlated negatively with bacterial loads during exacerbation. These data implicate deficient airway innate immunity in the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in some patients with COPD. Therapeutic approaches to boost innate antimicrobial immunity in the lung could be a viable strategy for prevention/treatment of frequent exacerbations.","publish_time":"2019-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singanayagam, Aran; Loo, Su-Ling; Calderazzo, Maria; Finney, Lydia J; Trujillo Torralbo, Maria-Belen; Bakhsoliani, Eteri; Girkin, Jason; Veerati, Punnam; Pathinayake, Prabuddha S; Nichol, Kristy S; Reid, Andrew; Foottit, Joseph; Johnston, Sebastian L; Bartlett, Nathan W; Mallia, Patrick","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55743de644f6eda86bbf752de5b73adaf33676df.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4ce668fe6eee9f59ed5ad0dfc0e9787777acd3be.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/632372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of frequent exacerbations","COPD","Patients","virus-associated exacerbations","sputum bacterial loads","sputum expression of immune mediators","reduced sputum levels","infrequent exacerbators","virus-associated exacerbation onset","innate immune mechanisms","immune responses","associated increase","sputum cell mRNA expression","anti-viral immune mediators","innate antimicrobial immunity","differentiated BECs","preceding year","MBL","deficient airway innate immunity","reduced interferon-stimulated gene","stable state","ISGs ex","better treatment options","differentiated bronchial epithelial cells","anti-microbial peptide mannose-binding lectin","rhinovirus infection","sub-group","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weeks","samples","interferons","increased propensity","susceptibility","lung","prevention","viable strategy","Therapeutic approaches","data","RV-induction","comparisons","study","groups","aim"],"language":"en"},

From 1950 to 2015, 130,494 human rabies cases were reported in Mainland China with an average of 1977 cases per year. It is estimated that 95% of these human rabies cases are due to dog bites. The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained recently on studying the transmission of rabies in China. We first construct a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and use the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010. Then we modify the basic model by including both domestic and stray dogs and apply the model to simulate the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. To study the seasonality of rabies, in Section 4 we further propose a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates and employ the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010. To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Section 5 we add diffusion to the dog population in the basic SEIR model to obtain a reaction\u2013diffusion equation model and determine the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium. Finally, in order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Section 6 we propose a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and use the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively.

As the environment dictates the success or failure of remyelination, it is critical to understand the role that the immune system plays in transplant-mediated remyelination. In this study, we evaluated the severity of neuroinflammation following transplantation of glial-committed progenitor cells into the spinal cords of mice chronically infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model in which T cells and macrophages are critical in amplifying the severity of demyelination. Transplantation was performed following viral persistence in which inflammation and demyelination are established and clinical disease is evident. Mice were sacrificed 10 and 21 days following progenitor cell transplantation and the effect on neuroinflammation evaluated. Treatment did not alter accumulation of T cells or macrophages within the CNS as compared to control mice. Moreover, progenitor cell implantation did not affect local cytokine/chemokine gene expression in the CNS. Finally, remyelination associated with transplantation did not result in an imbalance of TH1-associated cytokine production by virus-specific T cells. These studies demonstrate that progenitor cell-mediated remyelination is not the result of modulating the composition of the cellular infiltrate nor cytokine expression by virus-specific T cells and suggest that remyelination may not depend on amelioration of the inflammatory response or alteration of cytokine secretion by virus-specific T cells.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hardison, Jenny L.; Nistor, Gabriel; Gonzalez, Rafael; Keirstead, Hans S.; Lane, Thomas E.","journal":"Experimental Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094399.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001448860500364X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001448860500364X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["progenitor cells","virus-specific T cells","accumulation of T cells","competent cells","progenitor cell transplantation","Abstract Transplantation of remyelination","progenitor cell-mediated remyelination","failure of remyelination","cytokine expression","transplantation of glial","transplant-mediated remyelination","progenitor cell implantation","local cytokine","associated cytokine production","alteration of cytokine secretion","mouse hepatitis virus","macrophages","CNS","severity of demyelination","severity of neuroinflammation","control mice","result","spinal cords of mice","following viral persistence","chemokine gene expression","treatment of demyelinating diseases","promising strategy","inflammatory response","cellular infiltrate","imbalance of TH1","model","immune system","MHV","amelioration","composition","effect","days","clinical disease","role","success","studies","environment","study"],"language":"en"},

Quality Improvement Plan Provision of in-patient rehabilitation with on-site dialysis; a simplified referral system; preferential admission of elderly dialysis patients; short daily dialysis sessions; integrated multidisciplinary care by experts in rehabilitation, geriatric medicine, and nephrology; and reciprocal continued medical education among staff. Measures Outcome measures were percentage of patients discharged home, score on the Functional Independence Measure, and attainment of rehabilitation goals. Results In the first 36 months, 164 dialysis patients aged 74.5 \u00B1 7.8 years were admitted. On admission, patients had a mean Charlson comorbidity score of 7.8 \u00B1 2.5, 98% had difficulty walking, and 84% required help with bed-to-chair transfers. After a median of 48.5 days, 111 patients (69%) were discharged home; 15 patients (9%), to an assisted-living setting; 20 patients (12%), to a long-term care facility; and 18 patients (11%), to other facilities for acute or palliative care. Of those completing therapy, 82% met some or all of their rehabilitation goals. Limitations The program relied on the leadership and drive of key personnel. Discharge disposition as an outcome can be affected by many factors, and definition of attainment of rehabilitation goals is arbitrary.

Although it is known that macrophage numbers are elevated in the respiratory tract of IBV infected chickens, the role played by macrophages in IBV infection, particularly as a target cell for viral replication, is unknown. In this study, first, we investigated the ability of IBV to establish productive replication in macrophages in lungs and trachea in vivo and in macrophage cell cultures in vitro using two pathogenic IBV strains. Using a double immunofluorescent technique, we observed that both IBV Massachusetts-type 41 (M41) and Connecticut A5968 (Conn A5968) strains replicate in avian macrophages at a low level in vivo. This in vivo observation was substantiated by demonstrating IBV antigens in macrophages following in vitro IBV infection. Further, IBV productive infection in macrophages was confirmed by demonstrating corona viral particles in macrophages and IBV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in culture supernatants. Evaluation of the functions of macrophages following infection of macrophages with IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains revealed that the production of antimicrobial molecule, nitric oxide (NO) is inhibited. It was also noted that replication of IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains in macrophages does not interfere with the induction of type 1 IFN activity by macrophages. In conclusion, both M41 and Con A5968 IBV strains infect macrophages in vivo and in vitro resulting productive replications. During the replication of IBV in macrophages, their ability to produce NO can be affected without affecting the ability to induce type 1 IFN activity. Further studies are warranted to uncover the significance of macrophage infection of IBV in the pathogenesis of IBV infection in chickens.","publish_time":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amarasinghe, Aruna; Abdul-Cader, Mohamed Sarjoon; Nazir, Sadiya; De Silva Senapathi, Upasama; van der Meer, Frank; Cork, Susan Catherine; Gomis, Susantha; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef485cbb4af39866ed7fdb5ec0ce66f92e39511f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5538654.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763472/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Conn"],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of IBV","infection of macrophages","A5968 IBV strains","IBV antigens","IBV productive infection","replication of IBV M41","pathogenesis of IBV infection","pathogenic IBV strains","IBV Massachusetts-type","avian macrophages","functions of macrophages","significance of macrophage infection of IBV","IBV ribonucleic acid","respiratory tract of IBV infected chickens","Conn A5968 strains","Connecticut A5968","viral replication","macrophage cell cultures","induction of type","macrophage numbers","IFN activity","productive replications","respiratory disease","meat production","target cell","corona viral particles","production of antimicrobial molecule","trachea","role","loss of egg","lungs","nitric oxide","Infectious bronchitis virus","culture supernatants","low level","double immunofluorescent technique","Evaluation","observation","conclusion","studies","study"],"language":"en"},

Submission of genomic data to NCBI GenBank is a requirement prior to publication and plays a critical role in making scientific data publicly available. GenBank currently has automatic prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome annotation pipelines but has no viral annotation pipeline beyond influenza virus. Annotation and submission of viral genome sequence is a non-trivial task, especially for groups that do not routinely interact with GenBank for data submissions. RESULTS: We present Viral Annotation Pipeline and iDentification (VAPiD), a portable and lightweight command-line tool for annotation and GenBank deposition of viral genomes. VAPiD supports annotation of nearly all unsegmented viral genomes. The pipeline has been validated on human immunodeficiency virus, human parainfluenza virus 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses (229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1/SARS/MERS), human enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, Hepatitis A-E Virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, as well the human polyomaviruses BK/JC/MCV, human adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses. The program can handle individual or batch submissions of different viruses to GenBank and correctly annotates multiple viruses, including those that contain ribosomal slippage or RNA editing without prior knowledge of the virus to be annotated. VAPiD is programmed in Python and is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS systems. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a portable, lightweight, user-friendly, internet-enabled, open-source, command-line genome annotation and submission package to facilitate virus genome submissions to NCBI GenBank.

Internet search interest was found to be correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but has not yet been applied to the USA. Therefore, we examined the association of internet search-interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the USA. METHODS: We extracted COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA from two population-based datasets, namely 1-point-3-acres.com and the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data repository. The internet search-interest of COVID-19-related terms was obtained using Google Trends. The Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict trends, respectively. RESULTS: There were 636,282 new cases and,325 deaths of COVID-19 in the USA from March 1 to April 15, 2020, with a crude mortality of 4.45%. The daily new cases peaked at 35,098 cases on April 10, 2020 and the daily deaths peaked at 2,494 on April 15, 2020. The search interest of COVID, \u201CCOVID pneumonia\u201D and \u201CCOVID heart\u201D were correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence, with 12 or 14 days of delay (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19 days of delay (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively). The 7-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed no significant correlations of the observed data with the predicted daily new cases or daily deaths, using search interest of COVID, COVID heart, and COVID pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Search terms related to COVID-19 are highly correlated with the COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Xiaoling; Xu, Jie; Hussain, Sabiha; Wang, He; Gao, Nan; Zhang, Lanjing","journal":"Explor Res Hypothesis Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/924855757497658770d841c959cec97eebff5c41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176069.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348380/; https://doi.org/10.14218/erhm.2020.00023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","Johns Hopkins","Google","COVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deaths of COVID","COVID heart","COVID pneumonia","daily deaths","daily incidence","Johns Hopkins COVID","USA","predicted daily new cases","Search terms","deaths of coronavirus disease","association of internet search","observed data","data repository","days of delay","Pearson\u2019s r","related terms","significant correlations","Google Trends","general linear model","Pearson correlation test","OBJECTIVES","population-based datasets","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","China","day follow-up","RESULTS","crude mortality","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Design A retrospective, case-controlled study. Setting and participants A French nursing home for older adults between December 27, 2014 and January 20, 2015. Probable cases were residents presenting at least 1 respiratory symptom or 1 constitutional symptom. Confirmed cases identified in the same way as probable cases but with a positive RT-PCR test for hMPV. Controls were residents with no symptoms of respiratory infection. Measures Identification of hMPV was realized on nasal swab samples by RT-PCR. Results Seventy-eight older people were resident at the time of the outbreak. Three of the 4 tested were positive for hMPV by RT-PCR and negative for 13 other viruses or bacteria. All probable infected residents presented cough; other symptoms were scarcer. An inflammatory response was present, with median C-reactive protein at 50 mg/L. The median duration of the illness was 7 days. The rate of infection among residents was high (51%), with 5 hospitalizations (12.5%) and 1 death (2.5%). In multivariate analysis, vaccination against influenza virus appeared to emerge as associated with a probable hMPV infection, but this might be an artifact, as the proportion of unvaccinated residents was low (15%). A clear infected population profile was hard to define, although limited autonomy and low ADL score may play a role. Basic hygiene precautions were reinforced, but droplet precautions seemed difficult to apply rigorously to this population. Conclusions/Implications Clinical and biological presentations were nonspecific. The rate of infection was high, highlighting the need for the rapid introduction of strict precautions to contain the infection.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seynaeve, Damien; Augusseau-Rivi\u00E8re, Brigitte; Couturier, Pascal; Morel-Baccard, Christine; Landelle, Caroline; Bosson, Jean-Luc; Gavazzi, Ga\u00EBtan; Mallaret, Marie-Reine","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51493b0b75744eb4c140824fe17b1d83c6c5b172.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105973.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861019303020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101588/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2019.03.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861019303020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probable hMPV infection","clinical infection","rate of infection","probable infected residents","Probable cases","symptoms of respiratory infection","older adults","proportion of unvaccinated residents","Measures Identification of hMPV","positive RT-PCR test","older people","droplet precautions","respiratory symptom","outbreak","Confirmed cases","French nursing home","Basic hygiene precautions","Implications Clinical","rapid introduction of strict precautions","median duration","clear infected population profile","constitutional symptom","low ADL score","median C-reactive protein","nasal swab samples","biological presentations","limited autonomy","human metapneumovirus","need","risk factors","multivariate analysis","vaccination","influenza virus","Conclusions","time","participants","way","cough","inflammatory response","retrospective","case-controlled study","Abstract Objectives","illness","role","viruses","Results","days","artifact","bacteria","Controls","hospitalizations","death"],"language":"en"},

In the time of COVID-19\u0027s outbreak in Italy, the focus of the media was on elderly people for two main reasons. First, many older people demonstrated a very high civic sense and they were helping society to fight against the pandemic. Second, also in Italy, like in China, the older adults are at higher risk in being infected with COVID-19 and if they get ill, they have a higher risk of death. The balance previously achieved between age-related disorders and a good quality of life and good health is now under high pressure. It is very important to protect elderly people from infection, but also it is important to respect them and to support them in this complex situation. There is a great risk of \u0022ageism\u0022.

Infections are the first cause of hospital admission, which often occurs in the home country of pilgrims. Methods Literature review on PubMed from 1952 to November 2015 on the epidemiology and prevention of infections contracted during the Hajj, using the keywords \u201CHajj\u201D and \u201Cinfections\u201D. Results Respiratory tract infections, ENT infections, influenza, pyogenic pneumonia, whooping cough, and tuberculosis are most frequently observed during the Hajj. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been reported in pilgrims and their contacts. Waterborne infections such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis A are common, despite the improvement of health conditions. Pyoderma and furuncles are also frequently observed.

By using R18 labeled virus, we found that virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(6), 453\u2013e475. The clinical course of influenza and the extent of lung injury are determined by both viral and host factors, as well as sometimes secondary bacterial infections and exacerbations of underlying conditions. The balance between viral replication and the host immune responses is central to disease pathogenesis, and the extent of lung injury in severe influenza infections may be due in part to overly exuberant or dysregulated innate inflammatory responses or sometimes deficient responses. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the principal cause of respiratory failure associated with severe influenza. ARDS can be triggered by both direct lung insults (e.g. respiratory pathogens) and systemic insults (e.g. sepsis), and the lung damage is exacerbated by the inflammatory response associated with either infectious or non\u2010infectious insults. This workshop aimed to review the current understanding of lung injury in acute influenza and describe cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung injury that are common to influenza and infections by other respiratory pathogens. In addition, therapeutic agents that target host response proteins and pathways were identified and investigational agents in development reviewed. A logical strategy would be to combine antiviral treatment with drugs that modify excessive host responses or supplement deficient ones. However, a better understanding of common cell signalling pathways associated with acute lung injury caused by influenza and other pathogens is necessary to understand immunopathologic causes of lung injury. This will help determine which immunomodulatory interventions might be useful, and to predict the appropriate timing and consequences of their use.","publish_time":"2011-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Howard, Wendy A.; Peiris, Malik; Hayden, Frederick G.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba581dc8851307204bba0a4d63c9e1bf10ff6e26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780662.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00278.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21848616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Howard"],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute lung injury","extent of lung injury","acute influenza","lung damage","molecular mechanisms of lung injury","current understanding of lung injury","severe influenza infections","direct lung insults","respiratory pathogens","clinical course of influenza","excessive host responses","host immune responses","deficient responses","Respiratory Viruses","host factors","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","host response proteins","dysregulated innate inflammatory responses","principal cause of respiratory failure","ARDS","systemic insults","non\u2010infectious insults","workshop","secondary bacterial infections","better understanding of common cell signalling pathways","viral replication","immunomodulator interventions","therapeutic agents","investigational agents","immunomodulatory interventions","supplement deficient ones","disease pathogenesis","antiviral treatment","drugs","exacerbations of underlying conditions","sepsis","immunopathologic","appropriate timing","consequences","Ventura","addition","balance","Report","logical strategy","Howard","California","USA","development","paper","e475"],"language":"en"},

The nucleotide sequence revealed open reading frames of 1443 or 1453 amino acids, respectively. Structural features include an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, a hydrophilic cysteine-rich cluster near the C-terminus, two heptad repeats and 29 or 33 potential N-glycosylation sites. Pairwise comparisons of S amino acid sequences from these isolates with other CCV strains (Insavc1 and K378) revealed that heterogeneity, found mostly in the form of conservative substitutions, is distributed throughout the canine sequences. However, 5 variable regions could be identified. Similar analysis with feline, porcine, murine, chicken and human coronavirus sequences revealed that the canine sequences are much more closely related to the feline S protein sequence than to the porcine S protein sequences even though they are all from the same antigenic group. Moreover, the sequence similarity between CCV isolates and the feline coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was comparable. Expression of the CCV or the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) S gene using the vaccinia virus system produced a protein of the expected size which could induce extensive syncytia formation in infected canine A72 cells.","publish_time":"1995-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horsburgh, Brian C.; Brown, T.David K.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2190fffc3f76cc85a24e636882bd17bf2d3706aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170295000682; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170295000682","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["canine sequences","feline S protein sequence","porcine S protein sequences","feline coronavirus","S gene","canine coronavirus","CCV isolates","human coronavirus sequences","CCV strains","comparisons of S amino acid sequences","nucleotide sequence","sequence similarity","feline infectious peritonitis virus","N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence","infected canine A72 cells","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","vaccinia virus system","distinct strains","amino acids","potential N-glycosylation sites","extensive syncytia formation","hydrophilic cysteine-rich cluster","TGEV","chicken","C-terminus","expected size","open reading frames","FIPV","Insavc1","heptad repeats","K378","Structural features","Similar analysis","heterogeneity","spike","form of conservative substitutions","Expression","variable regions","antigenic group"],"language":"en"},

Background Human metapneumovirus (hPMV) is a recently identified virus that is recognized as a cause of respiratory tract illness in the pediatric population. Objectives To determine the incidence of respiratory tract infections caused by hPMV in hospitalized infants and to describe the clinical characteristics and possible presence of coinfection with other viral agents. Patients and methods We performed a prospective study from September to June 2003 in all children aged less than 24 months who were admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Legan\u00E9s, Madrid) with a respiratory tract infection. Virological diagnosis was made with a direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washing. Demographic and clinical data from patients with an hPMV respiratory tract infection were analyzed. Results During the study period, 200 infants were admitted with a respiratory tract infection, of which 18 (9 %) had an hPMV infection. HPMV was the viral agent isolated in 13.8% of positive nasopharyngeal washings. All patients were admitted between March and April. The mean age was 6.7 \u00B1 6.1 months. The most common diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (55.5 %) and bronchiolitis (38.8%). Oxygen therapy was required by 55.5 % of infants during hospitalization. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was confirmed in 33.3% of the patients. Conclusions Human metapneumovirus is a major cause of respiratory tract illness in hospitalized infants. This virus causes mainly bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing and is more frequent in spring. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses is frequent.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa Garc\u00EDa, M.aL.; Calvo Rey, C.; Mart\u00EDn del Valle, F.; L\u00F3pez Huertas, M.

OBJECTIVES: To develop and technically validate a novel one-step real-time RT-PCR assay which can be used for influenza A virus screening and subtyping of A/H1N1v in a singleplex fashion. To assess the clinical performance of a novel commercial influenza RT-PCR kit based on the in-house version. STUDY DESIGN: A real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the matrix gene of influenza A viruses was developed and validated using in vitro transcribed RNA derived from influenza A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus as well as plaque-quantified influenza A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus samples. After validation of the in-house version the commercial RealStar kit was used to assess the clinical performance and specificity on a panel of influenza viruses including A/H1N1v, A/H1N1, swine A/H1N1, A/H3N2, avian A/H5N1 as well as patient specimens. RESULTS: The lower limit of detection of the in-house version was 2149, 1376 and 2994 RNA copies/ml for A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, respectively. The RealStar kit displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity and could reliably discriminate influenza A viruses from A/H1N1v. No cross reaction with swine A/H1N1 and A/H1N2 was observed with the RealStar A/H1N1v specific probe. CONCLUSION: Both assays demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity and might assist in the diagnosis of suspected influenza cases.","publish_time":"2010-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panning, Marcus; Baumgarte, Sigrid; Laue, Thomas; Bierbaum, Sibylle; Raith, Sabine; Drexler, Jan Felix; Helmer, Angelika; Falcone-Kapper, Valeria; Kochs, Georg; Campe, Hartmut; Huzly, Daniela; Eis-H\u00FCbinger, Anna Maria; Drosten, Christian","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f9f539f4b33b310b7db749ded58064706a68e19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172518.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210004166; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.10.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210004166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21075679/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel influenza","discriminate influenza","influenza pandemic","seasonal influenza viruses","panel of influenza viruses","matrix gene of influenza","plaque-quantified influenza","novel commercial influenza RT-PCR kit","diagnosis of suspected influenza cases","H1N1v specific probe","specificity","in-house version","H3N2 virus samples","commercial RealStar kit","virus screening","novel one-step real-time RT-PCR assay","clinical performance","swine","Reliable detection","high sensitivity","RNA copies","transcribed RNA","lower limit of detection","appropriate case management","differentiation","H5N1","assays","subtype","public health","STUDY DESIGN","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","cross reaction","validation","BACKGROUND","patient specimens","singleplex fashion","century","H1N2","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Here, we will review how the classical type I interferon response and the recently described antiviral RNAi pathways interact in mammalian cells. Specifically, we will uncover how the small RNA biogenesis pathway, composed by the nucleases Drosha and Dicer can act as direct antiviral factors, and how the type-I interferon response regulates the function of these. We will also describe how the factors involved in small RNA biogenesis and specific small RNAs impact the activation of the type I interferon response and antiviral activity.

For instance, the outward facing apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells lacks receptors for agents, such as hepatitis C virus, herpesvirus, reovirus, poliovirus or adenovirus. In addition, macrophages eliminate pathogens from the luminal space. Here we show that human adenovirus type 5 engages an antiviral immune response to enter polarized epithelial cells. Blood-derived macrophages co-cultured apically on polarized epithelial cells facilitate epithelial infection. Infection also occurs in the absence of macrophages, if virus-conditioned macrophage-medium containing the chemotactic cytokine CXCL8 (interleukin-8), or recombinant CXCL8 are present. In polarized cells, CXCL8 activates a Src-family tyrosine kinase via the apical CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors. This activation process relocates the viral co-receptor \u03B1\u03BD\u03B23 integrin to the apical surface, and enables apical binding and infection with adenovirus depending on the primary adenovirus receptor CAR.

Controlling these viruses in birds as well as understanding their emergence into, and transmission amongst, humans will require considerable ingenuity and understanding of how different species defend themselves. The type I interferon-coordinated response constitutes the major antiviral innate defence. Although interferon was discovered in chicken cells, details of the response, particularly the identity of hundreds of stimulated genes, are far better described in mammals. Viruses induce interferon-stimulated genes but they also regulate the expression of many hundreds of cellular metabolic and structural genes to facilitate their replication. This study focusses on the potentially anti-viral genes by identifying those induced just by interferon in primary chick embryo fibroblasts. Three transcriptomic technologies were exploited: RNA-seq, a classical 3\u2032-biased chicken microarray and a high density, \u201Csense target\u201D, whole transcriptome chicken microarray, with each recognising 120\u2013150 regulated genes (curated for duplication and incorrect assignment of some microarray probesets).

For example, medium consumption should be low to obtain a very high concentration of viable host cells in an economical way but must be balanced against the requirement that accumulation of toxic metabolites and limitation of nutrients have to be avoided. HCD cultivations should also be optimized to avoid unwanted induction of apoptosis or autophagy during the early phase of virus infection. To realize the full potential of HCD cultivations, a rational analysis of the cultivation conditions of the appropriate host cell line together with the optimal infection conditions for the chosen viral vaccine strain needs to be performed for each particular manufacturing process. We here illustrate our strategy for production of the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus isolate MVA-CR19 in the avian suspension cell line AGE1.CR.pIX at HCD. As a first step we demonstrate that the adjustment of the perfusion rate strictly based on the measured cell concentration and the glucose consumption rate of cells enables optimal growth in a 0.8 L bioreactor equipped with an ATF2 system. Concentrations up to 57 \u00D7 106 cells/mL (before infection) were obtained with a viability exceeding 95%, and a maximum specific cell growth rate of 0.019 h\u22121 (doubling time = 36.5 h). However, not only the cell-specific MVA-CR19 virus yield but also the volumetric productivity was reduced compared to infections at conventional-cell-density (CCD). To facilitate optimization of the virus propagation phase at HCD, a larger set of feeding strategies was analyzed in small-scale cultivations using shake flasks. Densities up to 63 \u00D7 106 cells/mL were obtained at the end of the cell growth phase applying a discontinuous perfusion mode (semi-perfusion) with the same cell-specific perfusion rate as in the bioreactor (0.060 nL/(cell d)). At this cell concentration, a medium exchange at time of infection was required to obtain expected virus yields during the first 24 h after infection. Applying an additional fed-batch feeding strategy during the whole virus replication phase resulted in a faster virus titer increase during the first 36 h after infection. In contrast, a semi-continuous virus harvest scheme improved virus accumulation and recovery at a rather later stage of infection. Overall, a combination of both fed-batch and medium exchange strategies resulted in similar cell-specific virus yields as those obtained for CCD processes but 10-fold higher MVA-CR19 titers, and four times higher volumetric productivity.","publish_time":"2018-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"V\u00E1zquez-Ram\u00EDrez, Daniel; Genzel, Yvonne; Jordan, Ingo; Sandig, Volker; Reichl, Udo","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433897/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.112; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18300653; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18300653","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCD","CCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-cell","conventional-cell","similar cell-specific virus","cell d","cell-specific MVA-CR19 virus","cell growth phase","cell-specific perfusion rate","virus accumulation","measured cell concentration","expected virus","early phase of virus infection","virus propagation phase","virus replication phase","maximum specific cell growth rate","virus isolate MVA-CR19","appropriate host cell line","time of infection","avian suspension cell line","cell culture-based vaccine manufacturing","faster virus titer","optimal infection conditions","potential of HCD cultivations","semi-continuous virus harvest scheme","semi-perfusion","later stage of infection","glucose consumption rate of cells","optimal growth","higher MVA-CR19 titers","medium consumption","small-scale cultivations","high concentration of viable host cells","medium exchange strategies","discontinuous perfusion mode","strategy","bioreactor","density","times higher volumetric productivity","yield","additional fed-batch","cultivation conditions","larger set of feeding strategies","doubling time","CCD processes","accumulation of toxic metabolites","particular manufacturing process","chosen viral vaccine strain","modified vaccinia Ankara","recovery","autophagy","rational analysis","pIX","infections","production","economical way","contrast","unwanted induction of apoptosis","limitation of nutrients","requirement","shake flasks","example","adjustment","nL","optimization","end","number of challenges","ATF2 system","Abstract","step","combination","Concentrations","Densities","viability"],"language":"en"},

A number of public health issues significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in the UAE. This article summarises the findings of a panel of medical and public health specialists from UAE University and various government health agencies commissioned to report on the health status of the UAE population. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed articles on health in the UAE, and unpublished data were provided by government health authorities and local hospitals. RESULTS: The panel reviewed and evaluated all available evidence to list and rank (1=highest priority) the top four main public health issues: 1) Cardiovascular disease accounted for more than 25% of deaths in 2010; 2) Injury caused 17% of mortality for all age groups in 2010; 3) Cancer accounted for 10% of all deaths in 2010, and the incidence of all cancers is projected to double by 2020; and 4) Respiratory disorders were the second most common non-fatal condition in 2010. CONCLUSION: The major public health challenges posed by certain personal (e.g. ethnicity, family history), lifestyle, occupational, and environmental factors associated with the development of chronic disease are not isolated to the UAE; rather, they form part of a global health problem, which requires international collaboration and action. Future research should focus on population-based public health interventions that target the factors associated with the development of various chronic diseases.","publish_time":"2013-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loney, Tom; Aw, Tar-Ching; Handysides, Daniel G.; Ali, Raghib; Blair, Iain; Grivna, Michal; Shah, Syed M.; Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud; El-Sadig, Mohamed; Sharif, Amer A.; El-Obaid, Yusra","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60e49bb744eb678ae1ac1fb9bb920a5b01954041.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3566378.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23394856/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v6i0.20100","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UAE University"],"locations":["United Arab Emirates","UAE"],"keyphrases":["public health specialists","public health interventions","public health strategies","health status","main public health issues","number of public health issues","UAE population","major public health challenges","government health authorities","global health problem","various government health agencies","UAE University","multinational population","development of chronic disease","mortality","deaths","development of various chronic diseases","panel of medical","environmental factors","Cardiovascular disease","peer-reviewed articles","religious beliefs","varying educational backgrounds","lifestyle","family history","rank","ethnicity","unpublished data","morbidity","cultural practices","international collaboration","available evidence","highest priority","United Arab Emirates","local hospitals","developing country","CONCLUSION","common non-fatal condition","systematic literature search","METHODS","findings","Respiratory disorders","age groups","action","incidence","Future research","Injury","cancers","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this experiment was to assess the productivity and economic importance of naturally occurring health challenges (HC) under commercial conditions. Three 1,000 pig grow-finish facilities received 936 pigs each. The experimental period started approximately 34 d post placement at an average start BW of 13.1 \u00B1 0.2 kg. Barns were characterized based on the relative HC, determined by diagnostic assessments as the main characterization tool, along with other health indicators. Barns were characterized as low challenge health (LCh), moderate challenge health (MCh), and high challenge health (HCh). All barns tested positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection prior to the start of the experiment. Additionally, the MCh and HCh barns experienced influenza type A virus of swine. Similar to commercial production conditions, the disease challenge was not imposed but rather occurred naturally. Reduced ADG, ADFI, and G:F were observed with an increased HC (P \u003C 0.001). Similarly, mortality was increased when the HC increased (P \u003C 0.001). Decreased ADG increased days to achieve harvest BW, by 10 and 15 d in the MCh and HCh treatments compared with LCh, respectively (P \u003C 0.001). No differences were observed for percent lean, loin depth, or fat depth (P \u003E 0.10). The economic impact of the HC was assessed by applying these growth performance data to two economic models encompassing the two main marketing methods used by U.S. pig producers: fixed-weight and fixed-time. Financial losses attributed to the variation in disease severity that occurred in the present study ranged from $8.49 and $26.10 U.S. dollars (USD)/pig marketed using a fixed-market weight model, or between $11.02 and $29.82 USD/pig using a fixed-time model, depending on feed costs and market hog prices. In conclusion, increasing severity of HC under commercial conditions reduced ADG by 8% and 14% and resulted in mortality as high as 19.9%. Losses of $8.49 to $29.82/pig marketed underscore the potential magnitude of the economic impact of mixed etiology concurrent diseases in pork production.","publish_time":"2018-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cornelison, A S; Karriker, L A; Williams, N H; Haberl, B J; Stalder, K J; Schulz, L L; Patience, J F","journal":"Transl Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93857e54224281141f7abaa8365dc43fad5ae9a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289106/; https://doi.org/10.1093/tas/txx005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["increased HC","pig producers","pig performance","severity of HC","high challenge health","commercial conditions","disease challenge","relative HC","moderate challenge health","low challenge health","commercial production conditions","health challenges","MCh","health indicators","fixed-weight","fixed-time model","economic models","economic importance","fixed-market weight model","disease severity","Reduced ADG","HCh barns experienced influenza","Decreased ADG increased days","pork production","LCh","HCh treatments","USD","mortality","economic impact of mixed etiology concurrent diseases","average start BW","loin depth","fat depth","virus of swine","harvest BW","Financial losses","d post placement","main characterization tool","main marketing methods","growth performance data","market hog prices","respiratory syndrome virus infection","feed costs","diagnostic assessments","carcass quality","percent lean","potential magnitude","ADFI","variation","net returns","experimental period","finish facilities","productivity","present study","pigs","differences","conclusion","dollars","objective"],"language":"en"},

Although the microbiology of the nasopharynx is an important determinant of the complications of URI, little is known of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota of children, the factors that affect its composition, and its precise relationship with URI. RESULTS: Healthy children (n = 47) aged 49\u201384 months from a prospective cohort study based in Wisconsin, USA, were examined. Demographic and clinical data and NP swab samples were obtained from participants upon entry to the study. All NP samples were profiled for bacterial microbiota using a phylogenetic microarray, and these data were related to demographic characteristics and upper respiratory health outcomes. The composition of the NP bacterial community of children was significantly related prior to the history of acute sinusitis (R(2) = 0.070, P \u003C 0.009). History of acute sinusitis was associated with significant depletion in relative abundance of taxa including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia spp. and enrichment of Moraxella nonliquefaciens. Enrichment of M. nonliquefaciens was also a characteristic of baseline NP samples of children who subsequently developed acute sinusitis over the 1-year study period. Time to develop URI was significantly positively correlated with NP diversity, and children who experienced more frequent URIs exhibited significantly diminished NP microbiota diversity (P \u2264 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that previous history of acute sinusitis influences the composition of the NP microbiota, characterized by a depletion in relative abundance of specific taxa. Diminished diversity was associated with more frequent URIs.

However, the pathogenesis of severe dengue remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the Rac1-microfilament signal pathway was involved in the process of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) infection in EAhy926 cells. DENV2 infection induced dynamic changes in actin organization, and treatment with Cytochalasin D or Jasplakinolide disrupted microfilament dynamics, reduced DENV2 entry, and inhibited DENV2 assembly and maturation. Rac1 activities decreased during the early phase and gradually increased by the late phase of infection. Expression of the dominant-negative form of Rac1 promoted DENV2 entry but inhibited viral assembly, maturation and release. Our findings demonstrated that Rac1 plays an important role in the DENV2 life cycle by regulating actin reorganization in EAhy926 cells. This finding provides further insight into the pathogenesis of severe dengue.","publish_time":"2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jing; Wu, Na; Gao, Na; Yan, Wenli; Sheng, Ziyang; Fan, Dongying; An, Jing","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/328d3308c2b143141a3302cc60e7872b8786e75a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-016-5042-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27056258/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV2 infection","inhibited DENV2 assembly","reduced DENV2 entry","DENV2 life cycle","pathogenesis of severe dengue","Rac1 activities","Rac1-microfilament signal pathway","late phase of infection","maturation","clinical characteristic of severe dengue","EAhy926 cells","dominant-negative form of Rac1","actin organization","actin reorganization","microfilament dynamics","viral assembly","early phase","Jasplakinolide","Cytochalasin D","treatment","important role","dynamic changes","process of DENV serotype","Expression","Bleeding","release","insight","findings","vascular permeability","study"],"language":"en"},

We determined the nucleotide sequence of the N gene and the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of eight naturally occurring strains of IBV which differed in pathogenicity and tissue tropism. In pairwise comparisons, the deduced amino acid sequences of N of five strains Vic S, N1/62, N9/74, N2/75, and V5/90 (group I) shared 92.3\u201398.8% identity. The three strains N1/88, Q3/88, and V18/91 (group II) shared 85.8\u201389.2% identity with each other, but only 60.0\u201363.3% identity with viruses of group I. Amino acid substitutions, deletions, and insertions occurred throughout the N protein and involved regions previously identified as being conserved. Despite the considerable variation observed between the two virus groups, all N proteins contained a high proportion of basic residues, 80% of which were conserved in position. In addition, all strains contained approximately 30 serine residues of which 10 were conserved, the majority occurring between positions 168 and 194. As for all other coronaviruses, the region between positions 92 and 103 was highly conserved. Hence, a large number of amino acid changes can be tolerated within the N protein without affecting its integrity or functioning. The 3\u2032 UTR immediately downstream from the N gene was highly heterogeneous with extensive deletions occurring in the group II strains.","publish_time":"1996-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sapats, S.

More than one agent was identified in 12 infants with diarrhea and in five asymptomatic room contacts. No wardwide etiologic pattern was evident, but minirotavirus or calicivirus or both were associated with diarrhea in 20 patients, accompanied by vomiting in 15 of these infants. Moreover, spread of individual agents was almost entirely limited to minirotavirus and calicivirus, with diarrhea in six of ten, and four of seven, virus positive room contacts, respectively. These viruses were also identified in stools from 12 infants without diarrhea, seven of whom had repeated vomiting.

Totally 5775 occupants (\u226518 years old) from a stratified random sample of multi-family buildings in Sweden participated (46%). 51.0% had rhinitis in the last 3 months (current rhinitis); 11.5% doctor diagnosed asthma; 46.4% respiratory infections in the last 3 months and 11.9% antibiotic medication for respiratory infections in the last 12 months. Associations between home environment and health were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, controlling for gender, age and smoking and mutual adjustment. Buildings constructed during 1960\u20131975 were risk factors for day time breathlessness (OR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.03\u20132.29). And those constructed during 1976\u20131985 had more current rhinitis (OR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.12\u20131.84) and respiratory infections (OR = 1.46, 95%CI 1.21\u20131.78). Cities with higher population density had more current rhinitis (p = 0.008) and respiratory infections (p\u003C0.001). Rented apartments had more current rhinitis (OR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.07\u20131.40), wheeze (OR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.02\u20131.41), day time breathlessness (OR = 1.31, 95%CI 1.04\u20131.66) and respiratory infections (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 1.01\u20131.26). Living in colder parts of the country was a risk factor for wheeze (p = 0.03) and night time breathlessness (p = 0.002). Building dampness was a risk factor for wheeze (OR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.08\u20131.86) and day time breathlessness (OR = 1.57, 95%CI 1.09\u20132.27). Building dampness was a risk factor for health among those below 66 years old. Odor at home was a risk factor for doctor diagnosed asthma (OR = 1.49, 95%CI 1.08\u20132.06) and current asthma (OR = 1.52, 95%CI 1.03\u20132.24). Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) was a risk factor for current asthma (OR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.09\u20132.16). Window pane condensation was a risk factor for antibiotic medication for respiratory infections (OR = 1.41, 95%CI 1.10\u20131.82).

Over the past decade, we aimed to decipher how the extra domains/co-factors mediate the catalytic machineries of SARS 3C-like, Dengue and Zika NS2B-NS3 proteases by characterizing their folding, structures, dynamics and inhibition with NMR, X-ray crystallography and MD simulations, and the results revealed: 1) the chymotrypsin fold of the SARS 3C-like protease can independently fold, while, by contrast, those of Dengue and Zika proteases lack the intrinsic capacity to fold without co-factors. 2) Mutations on the extra domain of SARS 3C-like protease can transform the active catalytic machinery into the inactive collapsed state by structurally-driven allostery. 3) Amazingly, even without detectable structural changes, mutations on the extra domain are sufficient to either inactivate or enhance the catalytic machinery of SARS 3C-like protease by dynamically-driven allostery. 4) Global networks of correlated motions have been identified: for SARS 3C-like protease, N214A inactivates the catalytic machinery by decoupling the network, while STI/A and STIF/A enhance by altering the patterns of the network. The global networks of Dengue and Zika proteases are coordinated by their NS2B-cofactors. 5) Natural products were identified to allosterically inhibit Zika and Dengue proteases through binding a pocket on the back of the active site. Therefore, by introducing extra domains/cofactors, nature develops diverse strategies to regulate the catalytic machinery embedded on the chymotrypsin fold through folding, structurally- and dynamically-driven allostery, all of which might be exploited to develop antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Liangzhong; Gupta, Garvita; Roy, Amrita; Kang, Jian; Srivastava, Shagun; Shi, Jiahai; Song, Jianxing","journal":"Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba817ff6b435579197b0e13495447338a7a0f9a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111307.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217495/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718301421; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.08.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610718301421","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","STI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catalytic machinery of SARS","Zika proteases","Dengue proteases","catalytic machineries of SARS","active catalytic machinery","chymotrypsin fold","extra domain of SARS","Zika NS2B-NS3 proteases","extra domains","co-factors","driven allostery","Flavivirus NS2B-NS3 proteases","global networks of Dengue","NS2B-cofactors","Mutations","additional domains","folding","Global networks of correlated motions","active site","NMR","inactive collapsed state","inhibition","X-ray crystallography","diverse strategies","intrinsic capacity","MD simulations","dynamics","structures","nature","detectable structural changes","N214A","results","pocket","contrast","Abstract Coronavirus","Natural products","past decade","antiviral drugs","STIF","patterns"],"language":"en"},

Lactobacillus spp. have emerged as attractive candidates to meet this need and are known to activate the host innate immune response in a species- and strain-specific manner. For selected bacterial isolates and mutants, we investigated the role of key innate immune pathways required for induction of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Co-culture of murine macrophages with L. gasseri (strain NCK1785), L. acidophilus (strain NCFM), or NCFM-derived mutants\u2014NCK2025 and NCK2031\u2014elicited an M2b-like phenotype associated with TH2 skewing and immune regulatory function. For NCFM, this M2b phenotype was dependent on expression of lipoteichoic acid and S layer proteins. Through the use of macrophage genetic knockouts, we identified Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) receptor, and the inflammasome-associated caspase-1 as contributors to macrophage activation, with NOD2 cooperating with caspase-1 to induce inflammasome derived interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2 in a pyroptosis-independent fashion. Finally, utilizing an NCFM-based mucosal vaccine platform with surface expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag or membrane proximal external region (MPER), we demonstrated that NOD2 signaling is required for antigen-specific mucosal and systemic humoral responses. We show that lactobacilli differentially utilize innate immune pathways and highlight NOD2 as a key mediator of macrophage function and antigen-specific humoral responses to a Lactobacillus acidophilus mucosal vaccine platform.","publish_time":"2018-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bumgardner, Sara A.; Zhang, Lin; LaVoy, Alora S.; Andre, Barbara; Frank, Chad B.; Kajikawa, Akinobu; Klaenhammer, Todd R.; Dean, Gregg A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4a0898920270c599908b3efbf4f7342a8b56c8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5937747.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29734365/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strain NCFM","antigen-specific mucosal","role of key innate immune pathways","mucosal vaccine platforms","immune regulatory function","NCFM-derived mutants","Lactobacillus acidophilus mucosal vaccine platform","antigen-specific humoral responses","subsequent adaptive immune responses","induction of innate","NOD2 cooperating","strain-specific manner","systemic humoral responses","macrophage activation","key mediator of macrophage function","strain NCK1785","M2b phenotype","inflammasome-associated caspase","receptor","inflammasome derived interleukin","use of macrophage genetic knockouts","expression of lipoteichoic acid","surface expression of human immunodeficiency virus type","HIV","species","membrane proximal external region","cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain","Gag","gasseri","MPER","Toll","NCK2025","TH2","contributors","S layer proteins","Co-culture of murine macrophages","TLR2","NCK2031","plethora of mucosally transmitted pathogens","pyroptosis-independent fashion","selected bacterial isolates","attractive candidates","host","lactobacilli","need"],"language":"en"},

AVFluIgG01 is a potent and broad-reactive H5N1-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb) showing great potential for use either for therapeutic purposes or as a basis of vaccine development, but its antigenic epitope and neutralization mechanism have not been finely characterized. In this study, we first demonstrated that AVFluIgG01 targets a novel conformation-dependent epitope in the globular head region of H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA). By selecting mimotopes from a random peptide library in combination with computational algorithms and site-directed mutagenesis, the epitope was mapped to three conserved discontinuous sites (I-III) that are located closely at the three-dimensional structure of HA. Further, we found that this HA1-specific human mAb can efficiently block both virus-receptor binding and post-attachment steps, while its Fab fragment exerts the post-attachment inhibition only. Consistently, AVFluIgG01 could inhibit HA-mediated cell-cell membrane fusion at a dose-dependent manner and block the acquisition of pH-induced protease sensitivity. These results suggest a neutralization mechanism of AVFluIgG01 by simultaneously blocking viral attachment to the receptors on host cells and interfering with HA conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. The presented data provide critical information for developing novel antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against HPAI H5N1 virus.","publish_time":"2012-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Zhiliang; Meng, Jiazi; Li, Xingxing; Wu, Ruiping; Huang, Yanxin; He, Yuxian","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03d40dcd5d29728439528bd955afcba42bc0c2b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3360650.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22662275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA","HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPAI H5N1 virus","neutralization mechanism of AVFluIgG01","HA-mediated cell-cell membrane fusion","broad-reactive H5N1","novel conformation-dependent epitope","post-attachment steps","viral attachment","antigenic epitope","post-attachment inhibition","HA conformational rearrangements","three-dimensional structure of HA","novel antiviral therapeutics","virus-receptor binding","globular head region of H5N1 hemagglutinin","HA1-specific human mAb","human monoclonal antibody","dose-dependent manner","importance of effective antiviral approaches","computational algorithms","pathogenic avian influenza","Fab fragment","combination","great potential","critical information","host cells","vaccines","random peptide library","acquisition of pH","therapeutic purposes","use","basis of vaccine development","induced protease sensitivity","continued spread","mutagenesis","receptors","presented data","mimotopes","results","conserved discontinuous sites","study"],"language":"en"},

We sought to examine the functional role of miR-155 in a model of viral-induced neuroinflammation. METHODS: Acute encephalomyelitis and immune-mediated demyelination were induced by intracranial injection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) into C57BL/6 miR-155(\u002B/\u002B) wildtype (WT) mice or miR-155(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Morbidity and mortality, viral load and immune cell accumulation in the CNS, and spinal cord demyelination were assessed at defined points post-infection. T cells harvested from infected mice were used to examine cytolytic activity, cytokine activity, and expression of certain chemokine receptors. To determine the impact of miR-155 on trafficking, T cells from infected WT or miR-155(\u2212/\u2212) mice were adoptively transferred into RAG1(\u2212/\u2212) mice, and T cell accumulation into the CNS was assessed using flow cytometry. Statistical significance was determined using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test or Student\u2019s T tests. RESULTS: Compared to WT mice, JHMV-infected miR-155(\u2212/\u2212) mice developed exacerbated disease concomitant with increased morbidity/mortality and an inability to control viral replication within the CNS. In corroboration with increased susceptibility to disease, miR-155(\u2212/\u2212) mice had diminished CD8(\u002B) T cell responses in terms of numbers, cytolytic activity, IFN-\u03B3 secretion, and homing to the CNS that corresponded with reduced expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Both IFN-\u03B3 secretion and trafficking were impaired in miR-155(\u2212/\u2212), virus-specific CD4(\u002B) T cells; however, expression of the chemokine homing receptors analyzed on CD4(\u002B) cells was not affected. Except for very early during infection, there were not significant differences in macrophage infiltration into the CNS between WT and miR-155(\u2212/\u2212) JHMV-infected mice, and the severity of demyelination was similar at 14 days p.i. between WT and miR-155(\u2212/\u2212) JHMV-infected mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a novel role for miR-155 in host defense in a model of viral-induced encephalomyelitis. Specifically, miR-155 enhances antiviral T cell responses including cytokine secretion, cytolytic activity, and homing to the CNS in response to viral infection. Further, miR-155 can play either a host-protective or host-damaging role during neuroinflammation depending on the disease trigger.","publish_time":"2016-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dickey, Laura L.; Worne, Colleen L.; Glover, Jessica L.; Lane, Thomas E.; O\u2019Connell, Ryan M.","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f37275235174f60a5028e7d86859fecd6550f737.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5015201.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-016-0699-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WT mice","JHMV-infected miR","impact of miR","JHMV-infected mice","CNS","functional role of miR","T cells","infected WT","T cell accumulation","viral infection","cytolytic activity","antiviral T cell responses","model of viral","cytokine activity","Student\u2019s T tests","viral load","viral replication","immune cell accumulation","chemokine homing receptors","cytokine secretion","reduced expression","expression of certain chemokine receptors","induced encephalomyelitis","induced neuroinflammation","IFN-\u03B3 secretion","host-damaging role","immune-mediated demyelination","mortality","cellular gene expression","severity of demyelination","increased morbidity","trafficking","host-protective","host defense","disease trigger","novel role","defined points post-infection","spinal cord demyelination","exacerbated disease concomitant","virus-specific CD4","chemokine receptor CXCR3","increased susceptibility","Acute encephalomyelitis","post-transcriptional level","neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","Mantel-Cox log-rank test","terms of numbers","intracranial injection","noncoding RNAs","macrophage infiltration","inability","significant differences","diminished CD8","MicroRNAs","miRNAs","findings","C57BL","days","METHODS","corroboration","wildtype","Statistical significance","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","flow cytometry","RESULTS","RAG1"],"language":"en"},

The evolutionary processes of the gene cluster, from marsupials to primates, were proposed based upon their genomic structures and phylogenetic relationships.","publish_time":"2009-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Y.W.; Meng, X.J.","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7efa4d3c6840cd707b87431df0f0f8c7749118d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103215.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2008.12.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X09000135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19166875/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X09000135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pCLEC4G gene","Human CLEC4G","porcine CLEC4G","DC-SIGN","human cluster of genes CD23","lectin gene cluster","Full-length pCLEC4G cDNA","gene structure","rat CLEC4G genes","SIGN homologues","pCLEC4G mRNA expression","unidentified porcine CD23 cDNA","untranslated region of CLEC4G mRNAs","lymph node","non-primates mammals","series of sequential intermediate products of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA","pig liver","domesticated animals","spleen tissues","predicted bovine","microRNA miR","representative mammalian species","complete coding region","multi-species-conserved site","important C-type lectins capable of mediating viral","canis","splicing","mouse","transmembrane protein","bacterial pathogen recognitions","chromosomal regions syntenic","rodents","chromosome 19p13","LSECtin","amino acids","genomic structures","phylogenetic relationships","opossum","thymus","evolutionary processes","exons","marsupials","study"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of PRRS virus and PED virus, alone or in combination, on growth performance, feed efficiency, and digestibility in grower pigs. Forty-two gilts (16 \u00B1 0.98 kg BW) na\u00EFve for PRRS and PED were selected and allocated to 1 of 4 treatments. Treatments included 1) a control, 2) PRRS virus infected, 3) PED virus infected, and 4) PRRS\u002BPED coinfection (PRP). Pigs in treatments 2 and 4 were inoculated with a live field strain of PRRS virus via intramuscular and intranasal routes at 0 d after inoculation (dpi). Treatments 3 and 4 were orally inoculated with a cloned PED virus at 15 dpi. Infection with PRRS virus was confirmed by quantitative PCR and seroconversion. Infection with PED virus was confirmed with PCR. Control pigs remained PRRS and PED virus negative throughout the study. All pigs were offered, ad libitum, a standard diet with free access to water. During the test period, PRRS reduced ADG and ADFI by 30 and 26%, respectively (P \u003C 0.05), compared with control pigs, whereas PRP decreased ADG, ADFI, and G:F by 45, 30, and 23%, respectively (P \u003C 0.05). Additional reductions in ADG and G:F were detected in PRP pigs compared with singular PED or PRRS treatments (33 and 16%, respectively). The impact of PED, alone or in combination, on performance (15\u201321 dpi) reduced ADG (0.66 vs. 0.35 vs. 0.20 kg/d; P \u003C 0.01), ADFI (1.22 vs. 0.88 vs. 0.67 kg/d; P = 0.003), and G:F (0.54 vs. 0.39 vs. 0.31; P = 0.001) compared with control pigs. Compared with control pigs, PRRS infection did not reduce apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and energy. However, PED infection, alone or in combination, decreased ATTD of DM and energy by 8 and 12%, respectively (P \u003C 0.05). Compared with control pigs, PRP reduced N and OM ATTD by 13 and 3%, respectively (P \u003C 0.05). No significant differences in apparent ileal digestibility (AID) were detected between virus challenges. However, Lys AID tended to be reduced in both PED treatments compared with the control (10 and 12%; P = 0.095). Altogether, PRRS reduced growth but did not alter digestibility. Pigs challenged with PED and, to a greater extent, the coinfection of PED and PRRS viruses had reduced ADG, ADFI, G:F, and ATTD of nutrients and energy.","publish_time":"2016-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schweer, W.

Rotaviruses, the leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children, are formed by three concentric layers of protein, and a genome composed of 11 segments of dsRNA. Here, we show that the RNAi machinery can be triggered to silence rotavirus gene expression by sequence-specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). RNAi is also useful for the study of the virus-cell interactions, through the silencing of cellular genes that are potentially important for the replication of the virus. Interestingly, while the translation of mRNAs is readily stopped by the RNAi machinery, the viral transcripts involved in virus genome replication do not seem to be susceptible to RNAi. Since gene silencing by RNAi is very efficient and specific, this system could become a novel therapeutic approach for rotavirus and other virus infections, once efficient methods for in vivo delivery of siRNAs are developed. Although the use of RNAi as an antiviral therapeutic tool remains to be demonstrated, there is no doubt that this technology will influence drastically the way postgenomic virus research is conducted.","publish_time":"2004-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arias, Carlos F; Dector, Miguel A; Segovia, Lorenzo; L\u00F3pez, Tom\u00E1s; Camacho, Minerva; Isa, Pavel; Espinosa, Rafaela; L\u00F3pez, Susana","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24ce4c59e7357e655bb893f951e05f25a936d849.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126860.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170204000310; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170204000310","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rotaviruses"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNAi machinery","use of RNAi","virus infections","virus genome replication","gene silencing","rotavirus gene expression","gene function","virus-cell interactions","way postgenomic virus research","study","antiviral therapeutic tool","efficient methods","triggered mechanism","delivery of siRNAs","powerful tool","segments of dsRNA","novel therapeutic approach","double-stranded RNA","Abstract RNA interference","silencing of cellular genes","sequence-specific short interfering RNAs","viral transcripts","leading cause of severe diarrhea","young children","system","technology","Rotaviruses","concentric layers of protein","evolution","translation of mRNAs","doubt"],"language":"en"},

We attempt to report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. Methods To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). Results Compared to other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To raise the understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we grouped the period into four different phases: Phase 1 (there was confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases found in Yogyakarta), Phase 2 (the first case in Yogyakarta detected), Phase 3 (the time when the cumulative cases surpass its peak), and Phase 4 (the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in Phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 procedures per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 procedures per week. Conclusions A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities. A comprehensive plan can improve both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manusubroto, Wiryawan; Wicaksono, Adiguno S.; Tamba, Daniel Agriva; Sudiharto, Paulus; Pramusinto, Handoyo; Hartanto, Rachmat Andi; Basuki, Endro","journal":"World Neurosurgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04370cab067c5371a34c90e8f7551926466a6290.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.124; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020310950?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442732/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020310950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery"],"locations":["Yogyakarta","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["Yogyakarta","pandemic ends","neurosurgical services","time","local data","neurosurgical staff","national data","records of","effect","outpatient neurosurgical activities","average","cumulative cases","impact of COVID","week","number of emergency surgical procedures","local government records","Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery","developed countries","number of elective operations","Indonesian Ministry of Health online database","utilization","safety","articles","decrease","period","Abstract Background","natural history","different phases","information","peak","comprehensive plan","understanding","Methods","Results","experience","writing","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Interaction of two extra-virion heptad repeats (HRs) in the gp41 plays a pivotal role in the fusion, and its inhibitor, enfuvirtide (T-20), blocks HIV-1 entry. To identify agents that block HIV-1 fusion, two screening methods based on detection and quantification by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle have been established. One method uses an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated antibody (Ab-ELISA) and the other uses an ALP-fused HR (F-ELISA) to detect and quantify the interaction of the two HRs. The F-ELISA was more simple and rapid, since no ALP-conjugated antibody reaction was required. Both ELISAs detected all the fusion inhibitors tested except for T-20. Interaction of the two HRs was observed in both ELISAs, even in the presence of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Ab-ELISA performed best in a pH ranging from 6 to 8, while F-ELISA performed best at a pH ranging from 7 to 8.

This article will focus on advances in laboratory tests that are available for the general practitioner for diagnosis of GI diseases. Laboratory tests for diagnosis of gastric and intestinal infectious diseases include fecal parasite screening tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for parvoviral enteritis, and some specific bacterial tests like fluorescent in situ hybridization for identification of specific bacteria attached to the intestinal epithelial cells. Serum concentrations of folate and cobalamin are markers of intestinal absorption, but are also changed in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Hypocobalaminemia is common in GI and pancreatic disease. Decreased serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity is a very sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in dogs and cats. Serum pancreatic lipase is currently the most sensitive and specific test to identify pancreatic cell damage and acute pancreatitis. However, serum canine pancreas-specific lipase is less sensitive in canine chronic pancreatitis. Increased serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity is also specific for pancreatic damage but is less sensitive. It is very likely that further studies will help to better specify the role of these new tests in the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatic diseases.","publish_time":"2011-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dossin, Olivier","journal":"Topics in Companion Animal Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51831f775b345bb4258cac71ca0473e528967dce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104967.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.tcam.2011.02.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1938973611000274; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1938973611000274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21596348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific bacterial tests","Serum pancreatic lipase","pancreatic damage","new tests","diagnosis of canine","diagnosis of GI diseases","diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency","specific test","feline pancreatic diseases","serum canine pancreas-specific lipase","pancreatic cell damage","panel of laboratory tests available","diagnosis of gastric","diagnosis of gastrointestinal","intestinal infectious diseases","identification of specific bacteria","Decreased serum trypsin","Increased serum trypsin","fecal parasite screening tests","intestinal bacterial overgrowth","Serum concentrations of folate","immunoreactivity","dogs","markers of intestinal absorption","intestinal epithelial cells","canine chronic pancreatitis","cats","acute pancreatitis","situ hybridization","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","parvoviral enteritis","fluorescent","general practitioner","advances","Hypocobalaminemia","article","role","studies"],"language":"en"},

The minimal \u2018cap0\u2019 consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate (ppp) bridge. Cap0 is further modified by 2\u2032-O-methylation of the next two riboses, yielding \u2018cap1\u2019 (m7GpppNmN) and \u2018cap2\u2019 (m7GpppNmNm). However, some viral RNAs lack 2\u2032-O-methylation, whereas others contain only ppp- at their 5\u2032-end. Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed effectors of innate immunity that inhibit viral replication by incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we investigated the ability of IFIT family members to interact with cap1-, cap0- and 5\u2032ppp- mRNAs and inhibit their translation. IFIT1 and IFIT1B showed very high affinity to cap-proximal regions of cap0-mRNAs (K(1/2,app) \u223C9 to 23 nM). The 2\u2032-O-methylation abrogated IFIT1/mRNA interaction, whereas IFIT1B retained the ability to bind cap1-mRNA, albeit with reduced affinity (K(1/2,app) \u223C450 nM). The 5\u2032-terminal regions of 5\u2032ppp-mRNAs were recognized by IFIT5 (K(1/2,app) \u223C400 nM). The activity of individual IFITs in inhibiting initiation on a specific mRNA was determined by their ability to interact with its 5\u2032-terminal region: IFIT1 and IFIT1B efficiently outcompeted eIF4F and abrogated initiation on cap0-mRNAs, whereas inhibition on cap1- and 5\u2032ppp- mRNAs by IFIT1B and IFIT5 was weaker and required higher protein concentrations.","publish_time":"2013-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Parimal; Sweeney, Trevor R.; Skabkin, Maxim A.; Skabkina, Olga V.; Hellen, Christopher U.

Rhinoviruses (RH) are responsible for acute respiratory illnesses, mainly in the upper respiratory tract. Population and methods. \u2014 3,152 children aged under 16 years, admitted to the Paediatrics department of the University Hospital Centre of Poitiers from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1995 with ear, nose and throat (ENT) and/or respiratory symptoms were systematically investigated. One hundred and forty-five RH strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions of 87 boys and 58 girls (mean age: 20.3 months). Among these, 92 (63.4%) were less than 1 year of age. Bacteriological investigations were done for 29 patients when a concomitant bacterial infection was suspected. Results. RH infection rate was maximum before 1 year of age (median age: 6.5 months) and decreased with age. RH were isolated throughout the 3 years, with a first peak from February to April, and a second one in autumn. The main symptoms were sibilants (27.6%) and cough (24.1%). Sibilants were more frequently associated in children under 12 months of age (P = 0.01). Sometimes, ophthalmologic or digestive symptoms were present. Three children with respiratory distress were transferred to the reanimation ward. In addition, a RH strain was isolated from a child who died of sudden infant death. Thirty-four children (23.4%) were co-infected by one or several viruses; the most frequently detected were the respiratory syncytial virus (41.2%) and the adenoviruses (35.3%). Twenty-nine children were infected by two viruses and five by three. Associated bacterial infections were diagnosed in 23 children, especially conjunctivitis due to Haemophilus influenzae (21.7%). Among these children, eight had a multiple viral infection. Conclusion. RH have a limited pathogenicity but can be associated with serious illnesses among infants and childen.","publish_time":"1998-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pierr\u00E8s-Surer, N; Beby-Defaux, A; Bourgoin, A; Venot, C; Berthier, M; Grollier, G; Oriot, D; Agius, G","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X97834598; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X97834598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Associated"],"locations":["Paediatrics"],"keyphrases":["children","months of age","year of age","respiratory symptoms","mean age","median age","RH strains","RH infection rate","respiratory distress","acute respiratory illnesses","upper respiratory tract","respiratory syncytial virus","concomitant bacterial infection","digestive symptoms","years","main symptoms","sibilants","multiple viral infection","serious illnesses","bacterial infections","Paediatrics department","boys","patients","girls","University Hospital Centre of Poitiers","nasopharyngeal secretions","sudden infant death","nose","throat","infants","childen","conjunctivitis","reanimation ward","Haemophilus influenzae","limited pathogenicity","Bacteriological investigations","addition","Rhinoviruses","Summary Background","Population","methods","cough","peak","Results","autumn","adenoviruses","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We show that cholesterol depletion of either the plasma membrane or the viral membrane by M\u03B2CD significantly impaired the infectivity of PrV strains Kaplan, Becker, and Bartha K-61. The virus was shown to have lower cholesterol content and to respond to lower M\u03B2CD concentrations. Exogenous cholesterol added to either M\u03B2CD-treated cells or virions partially restored the virus infectivity.

This review is devoted to interferon-inducible myxovirus resistance proteins as potential biomarkers for differentiating viral from bacterial infections. CONTENT: After viral infection, a branch of the interferon (IFN)-induced molecular reactions is triggered by the binding of IFNs with their receptors, a process leading to the activation of mx1 and mx2, which produce antiviral Mx proteins (MxA and MxB). We summarize current knowledge of the structures and functions of type I and III IFNs. Antiviral mechanisms of Mx proteins are discussed in reference to their structural and functional data to provide an in-depth picture of protection against viral attacks. Knowing such a mechanism may allow the development of countermeasures and the specific detection of any viral infection. Clinical research data indicate that Mx proteins are biomarkers for many virus infections, with some exceptions, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin have established positions as general biomarkers for bacterial infections. SUMMARY: Mx genes are not directly induced by viruses and are not expressed constitutively; their expression strictly depends on IFN signaling. MxA protein production in peripheral blood cells has been shown to be a clinically sensitive and specific marker for viral infection. Viral infections specifically increase MxA concentrations, whereas viruses have only a modest increase in CRP or procalcitonin concentrations. Therefore, comparison of MxA and CRP and/or procalcitonin values can be used for the differentiation of infectious etiology.","publish_time":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zav\u0027yalov, Vladimir P; H\u00E4m\u00E4l\u00E4inen-Laanaya, Heli; Korpela, Timo K; Wahlroos, Tony","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77d3990b78e6205191e981b785a3c3669fbce383.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108468.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2018.292391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral infections","viral attacks","antiviral Mx proteins","CRP","MxA concentrations","bacterial infections","Antiviral mechanisms of Mx proteins","procalcitonin concentrations","Mx genes","virus infections","comparison of MxA","MxA protein production","potential biomarkers","general biomarkers","procalcitonin values","viruses","interferon-inducible myxovirus resistance proteins","functional data","specific detection","specific marker","modest increase","binding of IFNs","C-reactive protein","Clinical research data","positions","in-depth picture of protection","low-cost diagnostic tools","peripheral blood cells","exceptions","mx2","reference","structures","optimal use of antibiotics","process","functions of type","development of countermeasures","branch","MxB","World Health Assembly","activation of mx1","molecular reactions","medicine","current knowledge","receptors","differentiation of infectious etiology","review","SUMMARY","CONTENT","expression","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) are antisense agents that enter cells readily and interfere with gene expression. Four PPMOs, targeting various locations in the JEV genome, were evaluated for antiviral activity against JEV in cultured cells and the mouse model of JEV infection. RESULTS: A PPMO (P10882) targeting the JEV 3\u2032 cyclization sequence (3\u2032CSI) had significant antiviral activity in Vero (epithelial), Neuro2A (neuronal) and J774E (macrophage) cells at concentrations that were not cytotoxic. P10882 added before infection suppressed JEV replication to an undetectable level in Vero cells and produced a 93% and 66% reduction in titre in J774E and Neuro2A cells, respectively, when measured at 24 h post-infection. In uninfected cells, fluorescein-labelled PPMOs entered J774E cells most efficiently, followed by Vero and Neuro2A cells. The antiviral effect of P10882 was also demonstrated in vivo, where 60%\u201380% of 1-week-old mice treated intracerebrally with a 20 mg/kg dose of P10882 every 12 h for 5 days were protected from a lethal dose of JEV and showed an undetectable level of virus in brain tissue at 2 days post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: P10882, which targets sequence that is highly conserved across members of the JEV serocomplex, was previously shown to be effective in a mouse model of West Nile disease, and represents a candidate antiviral agent against members of the JEV serocomplex.","publish_time":"2010-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anantpadma, Manu; Stein, David A.; Vrati, Sudhanshu","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d69cb1dd202569b16047de0d8ef3b7ac3b76310.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["J774E cells","JEV serocomplex","Vero cells","Neuro2A cells","JEV replication","JEV genome","cultured cells","uninfected cells","mouse model of JEV infection","lethal dose of JEV","dose of P10882","antiviral effect of P10882","significant antiviral activity","days post-infection","h post-infection","undetectable level of virus","candidate antiviral agent","members","fluorescein-labelled PPMOs","significant impact","cyclization sequence","mouse model of West Nile disease","Japanese encephalitis virus","brain tissue","Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers","Asia","CSI","pressing need","antisense agents","development of new therapeutics","METHODS","public health","BACKGROUND","concentrations","macrophage","various locations","titre","reduction","RESULTS","gene expression","CONCLUSIONS","week-old mice"],"language":"en"},

Using multiplex-PCR as the reference standard, the overall sensitivity was 77.9% and the specificity was 73.6%. Taking shell-viral culture as the reference method, the Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest (Leti diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain) sensitivity and specificity values were 80.0% and 60.9%, respectively. Using RT-PCR (Clart Pneumovir Version 3.0, Genomica, Madrid, Spain) as the reference standard, the viral culture sensitivity was 53.2% and the specificity was 100%. The Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest (Leti diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain) assay could be a simple and rapid method for antigenic detection of adenovirus in pediatric respiratory samples although it would be necessary to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the test.","publish_time":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romero-G\u00F3mez, Mar\u00EDa Pilar; L\u00F3pez, Rosario L\u00F3pez; Montes, Remedios Gonz\u00E1lez; Ruiz, Cristina Ots; Cuesta, Sara Hierro; Crespo, Mar\u00EDa Antonia Mart\u00EDn; Garc\u00EDa, Santos Garc\u00EDa","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e77157efd5d13bd2ed78788e151f191d5086ce37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119683.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.09.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093413003893; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093413003893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24096271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Barcelona","IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["Spain","IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest","respiratory tract infections","adenovirus antigen immunochromatography Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest","Leti diagnostics","pediatric respiratory samples","Barcelona","viral culture sensitivity","Rapid diagnosis of adenoviral respiratory infections","reference method","reference standard","multiplex PCR","multiplex-PCR","overall sensitivity","specificity values","shell-viral culture","Clart Pneumovir Version","rapid method","Madrid","Genomica","RT-PCR","shell-vial culture","patients","antigenic detection of adenovirus","oropharyngeal swabs specimens","subjects","nasopharyngeal washes","order","assay","optimal treatment strategies","bedside"],"language":"en"},

For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient\u0027s specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimens. Amplification techniques, most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently the workhorse of nucleic acid testing for the detection and quantitation of virus genomes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient\u0027s specimens, whereas virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels and/or avidity of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), for antigens, antibodies, and also nucleic acids are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use.

Among them, truncated glycans present terminal non-reducing \u03B2-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues that are rare on healthy tissues. Lectins from unconventional sources such as fungi or algi provide novel markers that bind specifically to such epitopes, but their availability may be challenging. A GlcNAc-binding lectin from the fruiting body of the fungus Psathyrella velutina (PVL) has been produced in good yield in bacterial culture. A strong specificity for terminal GlcNAc residues was evidenced by glycan array. Affinity values obtained by microcalorimetry and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated a micromolar affinity for GlcNAc\u03B21-3Gal epitopes and for biantennary N-glycans with GlcNAc\u03B21-2Man capped branches. Crystal structure of PVL complexed with GlcNAc\u03B21-3Gal established the structural basis of the specificity. Labeling of several types of cancer cells and use of inhibitors of glycan metabolism indicated that rPVL binds to terminal GlcNAc but also to sialic acid (Neu5Ac). Analysis of glycosyltransferase expression confirmed the higher amount of GlcNAc present on cancer cells. rPVL binding is specific to cancer tissue and weak or no labeling is observed for healthy ones, except for stomach glands that present unique \u03B1GlcNAc-presenting mucins. In lung, breast and colon carcinomas, a clear delineation could be observed between cancer regions and surrounding healthy tissues.

HCV extensively remodels intracellular membranes to establish its cytoplasmic replication factory and also usurps components of the intercellular lipid transport system for production of infectious virus particles.

Head-to-head comparisons of such assays using a single set of standard specimens provide additional information about key assay parameters such as sensitivity, specificity and lower limits of detection, and help to inform the decision regarding which method to use. We evaluated two real-time PCR platforms: the Fast-track Diagnostics\u00AE (FTD) multiplex respiratory panel and a TaqMan array card (TAC) for simultaneous uniplex detection of multiple respiratory pathogens. Two sets of samples were used to evaluate the assays. One set was created by spiking pooled nasal wash or phosphate buffered saline with specified volumes of known concentrations of virus and/or bacteria. Clinical nasal wash specimens from children with lower respiratory tract illness comprised the other set. Thirteen pathogen targets were compared between the two platforms. Testing with a validation panel of spiked samples revealed a sensitivity of 96.1% and 92.9% for the FTD and TAC assays, respectively. Specificity could not be reliably calculated due to a suspected contamination of the sample substrate. Inter-assay agreement was high (\u003E95%) for most targets. Previously untested clinical specimens tested by both assays revealed a high percent agreement (\u003E95%) for all except rhinovirus, enterovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Limitations of this evaluation included extraction of the validation samples by two different methods and the evaluation of the assays in different laboratories. However, neither of these factors significantly impacted inter-assay agreement for these sets of samples, and it was demonstrated that both assays could reliably detect clinically relevant concentrations of bacterial and viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Driscoll, Amanda J.; Karron, Ruth A.; Bhat, Niranjan; Thumar, Bhagvanji; Kodani, Maja; Fields, Barry S.; Whitney, Cynthia G.; Levine, Orin S.; O\u0027Brien, Katherine L.; Murdoch, David R.","journal":"Journal of Microbiological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82668d5d3289aa6a8a1348e5b52d344809bcd5e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114243.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167701214002991; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701214002991","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TAC assays","commercial assays","respiratory panel","validation samples","sets of samples","Inter-assay agreement","Clinical nasal wash specimens","single set of standard specimens","validation panel of spiked samples","nucleic acid of multiple respiratory pathogens","simultaneous uniplex detection of multiple respiratory pathogens","lower respiratory tract illness","viral pathogens","sensitivity","evaluation","untested clinical specimens","high percent agreement","specificity","FTD","pooled nasal wash","key assay parameters","lower limits of detection","single specimen","different methods","different laboratories","pathogen targets","relevant concentrations of bacterial","real-time PCR platforms","specified volumes of known concentrations of virus","phosphate buffered saline","children","additional information","TaqMan array card","Diagnostics","extraction","suspected contamination","sample substrate","rhinovirus","enterovirus","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Testing","factors","Head-to-head comparisons","Limitations","decision"],"language":"en"},

These findings triggered a plethora of reports defining 2-ME benefits for a multitude of immunological processes, primarily with murine models. This led to investigations on 2-ME alterations of (a) immune functions in other species, (b) activities of other cell-types, and (c) in situ diseases. In addition, the early findings may have been instrumental in identification of the previously undefined anticarcinogenic chemicals in specific foods as organosulfurs. Outside the plant organosulfurs, there are no comprehensive reviews of these areas to help define mechanisms by which organosulfurs function as well as identify potential alternative uses. Therefore, the present review will focus on 2-ME alterations of in vitro immune functions in species other than murine; namely, fish, amphibian, reptile, avian, whales, dolphins, rat, hamster, rabbit, guinea pig, feline, canine, porcine, ovine, bovine, and human. Processes, some unique to a given species, were in general, enhanced and in some cases dependent upon the presence of 2-ME. The largest benefits occurred in media that were serum free, followed by those in autologous serum and then fetal bovine serum supplemented medium. Concentrations of 2-ME were generally in the low \u03BCM range, with exceptions of those for salamander (20 mM), turtles (70 mM) and dolphins (7 mM). The few studies designed to assess mechanisms found that changes induced by 2-ME were generally accompanied by alterations of reduced/oxidized glutathione cellular concentrations.

Bats are likely the natural reservoir of alpha- and betacoronaviruses, and due to the rich diversity and global distribution of bats, the number of bat coronaviruses will likely increase. We conducted a surveillance of coronaviruses in bats in an abandoned mineshaft in Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, China, from 2012\u20132013. Six bat species were frequently detected in the cave: Rhinolophus sinicus, Rhinolophus affinis, Hipposideros pomona, Miniopterus schreibersii, Miniopterus fuliginosus, and Miniopterus fuscus. By sequencing PCR products of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp), we found a high frequency of infection by a diverse group of coronaviruses in different bat species in the mineshaft. Sequenced partial RdRp fragments had 80%\u201399% nucleic acid sequence identity with well-characterized Alphacoronavirus species, including BtCoV HKU2, BtCoV HKU8, and BtCoV1, and unassigned species BtCoV HKU7 and BtCoV HKU10. Additionally, the surveillance identified two unclassified betacoronaviruses, one new strain of SARS-like coronavirus, and one potentially new betacoronavirus species. Furthermore, coronavirus co-infection was detected in all six bat species, a phenomenon that fosters recombination and promotes the emergence of novel virus strains. Our findings highlight the importance of bats as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and the potentially zoonotic source of viral pathogens.

METHODS: Three locations were selected, at the scale of province, municipality and barangay (i.e. village). Data on disease incidence, programme activities, and programme management were collected on-site through meetings and focus group discussions. RESULTS: Adaptation of disease control strategies to the epidemiological situation per barangay, through micro-stratification, brings gains in efficiency, but should be accompanied by further capacity building on local situational analysis for better selection and targeting of vector control interventions within the barangay. An integrated approach to vector control, aiming to improve the rational use of resources, was evident with a multi-disease strategy for detection and response, and by the use of combinations of vector control methods. Collaboration within the health sector was apparent from the involvement of barangay health workers, re-orientation of job descriptions and the creation of a disease surveillance unit. The engagement of barangay leaders and use of existing community structures helped mobilize local resources and voluntary services for vector control. In one location, local authorities and the community were involved in the planning, implementation and evaluation of malaria control, which triggered local programme ownership. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that contributed to an improved efficiency and sustainability of vector control operations were: micro-stratification, integration of vector control within the health sector, a multi-disease approach, involvement of local authorities, and empowerment of communities. Capacity building on situational analysis and vector surveillance should be addressed through national policy and guidelines.","publish_time":"2012-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Berg, Henk; Velayudhan, Raman; Ebol, Antonietta; Catbagan, Ben HG; Turingan, Romulo; Tuso, Marisol; Hii, Jeffrey","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1da81f5357aef31dd451b4ed90e7fb255c9af8ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3425236.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-11-269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22873707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vector control methods","integration of vector control","vector control interventions","sustainability of vector control operations","management of vector control systems","vector surveillance","Adaptation of disease control strategies","evaluation of malaria control","local resources","disease incidence","multi-disease approach","local situational analysis","multi-disease strategy","involvement of local authorities","disease surveillance unit","local programme ownership","involvement of barangay health workers","disease-endemic countries","health sector","programme management","engagement of barangay leaders","micro-stratification","programme activities","improved efficiency","capacity building","sustainability of operations","rational use of resources","use of combinations","integrated approach","existing community structures","better selection","re-orientation of job descriptions","epidemiological situation","creation","voluntary services","response","respect","planning","municipality","meetings","implementation","detection","Data","RESULTS","scale of province","national policy","empowerment of communities","Collaboration","gains","group discussions","guidelines","locations","village","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In the present study 205 tracheal swabs and organs were collected from broilers and layers chicken farms during January to August 2012 from 19 governorates all over Egypt. The chickens demonstrated respiratory signs and mortality. Out of the examined samples, 130 of which (about 64%) of suspected farms were positive for IBV with real time RT-PCR. 13 IBV-positive samples were selected for further isolation and characterization. Isolation in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryos was carried out after studies three blind successive passages and the hypervariable region of spike protein1 (SP1) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to study the genetic diversity between the isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences of 13 isolates compared with other IBV strains from the Middle East and worldwide reveled that 11 out of the 13 isolates had close relationship the Israeli variants (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) with nucleotide homology reached up to 89.9% and 82.3%, respectively. Only two isolates had close relationship with CR/88121 and 4/91 viruses with identities of 95% and 96%, respectively. This study indicates existence of two variant groups of IBV circulating in Egypt during 2012. Group I was similar but distinguishable from Israeli variant IS/885 and group II was related to 4/91 and CR/88121 vaccine strains.

Chinese government has emphasized the importance of reducing carbon emissions and set the target of reducing carbon intensity to 60\u201365% of 2005 levels by 2030. Investigating the convergence of carbon intensity can identify the convergence rate, which is helpful in guiding allocations of carbon intensity reduction. The Yangtze River Delta is one of the key carbon emission regions in China, with higher urbanization levels and larger carbon emissions; thus, we employed prefecture-level panel data derived from grid data between 2000 and 2010 to examine whether the convergence of carbon intensity exists across prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Spatial panel data models were utilized to investigate \u03B2-convergence of carbon intensity. The results indicated that carbon intensity showed divergence during 2002\u20132004 and \u03C3-convergence over other periods (2000\u20132002 and 2004\u20132010). Carbon intensity exhibited stochastic convergence, indicating that the shocks to carbon intensity relative to the average level of carbon intensity are only transitory. There was a spatial spillover effect and \u03B2-convergence of carbon intensity, suggesting that prefecture-level cities with higher carbon intensity would decrease rapidly in the Yangtze River Delta.

The two viruses differ in their potential to cause disease. FeLV is more pathogenic, and was long considered to be responsible for more clinical syndromes than any other agent in cats. FeLV can cause tumors (mainly lymphoma), bone marrow suppression syndromes (mainly anemia), and lead to secondary infectious diseases caused by suppressive effects of the virus on bone marrow and the immune system. Today, FeLV is less commonly diagnosed than in the previous 20 years; prevalence has been decreasing in most countries. However, FeLV importance may be underestimated as it has been shown that regressively infected cats (that are negative in routinely used FeLV tests) also can develop clinical signs. FIV can cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that increases the risk of opportunistic infections, neurological diseases, and tumors.

Two species have been previously reported in dogs, minute virus of canines (MVC), associated with neonatal diseases and fertility disorders; and Canine bocavirus (CBoV), associated with respiratory disease. FINDINGS: In this study using deep sequencing of enriched viral particles from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure, we identified and characterized a novel bocavirus we named Canine bocavirus 3 (CnBoV3). The three major ORFs of CnBoV3 (NS1, NP1 and VP1) shared less than 60% aa identity with those of other bocaviruses qualifying it as a novel species based on ICTV criteria. Inverse PCR showed the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in liver. CONCLUSIONS: We genetically characterized a bocavirus in a dog liver that is highly distinct from prior canine bocaviruses found in respiratory and fecal samples.

Polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR\u2013RFLP) of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene locus, with gel electrophoresis, was used as a gold standard. Cohen\u0027s kappa statistic of agreement (\u043A) between the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) sucrose wet mount test and COWP PCR\u2013RFLP was 0.82, and the sensitivity and specificity of the OVC sucrose wet mount test were 88.6% and 93.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the lateral immunochromatography test were 78.3% and 93.3%, respectively, and agreement between this test and PCR\u2013RFLP was good (\u043A =0.73). There was substantial agreement between the OVC sucrose wet mount test and the lateral immunochromatography test (\u043A =0.84). Both tests were inexpensive and easy to use; however, the lateral immunochromatography test was faster and simpler to perform than the sucrose wet mount test, and was generally more user-friendly. These tests provide practitioners and researchers with cheap, quick and accurate methods of detecting C. parvum infection in young calves.","publish_time":"2005-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trotz-Williams, Lise A.; Martin, S.

These findings, taken together with lack of phylogenetic association to host, suggest that the HEV host specificity is a heritable and convergent phenotypic trait achievable through variety of genetic pathways (abundance), and explain a broad host range for HEV3 and HEV4.","publish_time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lara, James; Purdy, Michael A.; Khudyakov, Yury E.","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7c27adc151c7637bb836b9ce40a91cd39706bcc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/85410eee6126af27739d721539e7eb7d29a7f08c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8df832bfee48d69f00433bf2730940b5d0644714.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5745802.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134814000938; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5745802?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.03.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134814000938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HEV host specificity","HEV proteins","host origin of HEV strains","HEV genotypes","HEV4","broad host range","relevance of HEV genetic diversity","association of numerous coevolving sites","protein sites","polymorphic sites","swine","analysis of HEV3","adaptation","humans","lack of phylogenetic association","individual proteins","BN models","variety of genetic pathways","Hepatitis E virus","sporadic cases of hepatitis","convergent phenotypic trait achievable","domains","nonstructural polyprotein","epistatic connectivity","abundance","animals","accuracy","Bayesian network","primary reservoir","coevolution","data","findings"],"language":"en"},

Research on the active site of the molecule has led to development of effective inhibitors like oseltamivir, zanamivir etc, but the high rate of mutation and interspecies reassortment in viral sequences and the recent reports of oseltamivir resistant strains underlines the importance of determining additional target sites for developing future antiviral compounds. In a recent computational study of 173 H5N1 NA gene sequences we had identified a 50-base highly conserved region in 3\u0027-terminal end of the NA gene. RESULTS: We extend the graphical and numerical analyses to a larger number of H5N1 NA sequences (514) and H1N1 swine flu sequences (425) accessed from GenBank. We use a 2D graphical representation model for the gene sequences and a Graphical Sliding Window Method (GSWM) for protein sequences scanning the sequences as a block of 16 amino acids at a time. Using a protein sequence descriptor defined in our model, the protein sliding scan method allowed us to compare the different strains for block level variability, which showed significant statistical correlation to average solvent accessibility of the residue blocks; single amino acid position variability results in no correlation, indicating the impact of stretch variability in chemical environment. Close to the C-terminal end the GSWM showed less descriptor-variability with increased average solvent accessibility (ASA) that is also supported by conserved predicted secondary structure of 3\u0027 terminal RNA and visual evidence from 3D crystallographic structure. CONCLUSION: The identified terminal segment, strongly conserved in both RNA and protein sequences, is especially significant as it is surface exposed and structural chemistry reveals the probable role of this stretch in tetrameric stabilization. It could also participate in other biological processes associated with conserved surface residues. A RNA double hairpin secondary structure found in this segment in a majority of the H5N1 strains also supports this observation. In this paper we propose this conserved region as a probable site for designing inhibitors for broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure.","publish_time":"2010-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Ambarnil; Nandy, Ashesh; Nandy, Papiya","journal":"BMC Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8243fd9214e2e45a222a43aad977d882f17e1e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2836360.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6807-10-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170556/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA","GenBank","Graphical Sliding Window Method","GSWM","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein sequences","H5N1 NA gene sequences","viral sequences","conserved region","larger number of H5N1 NA sequences","terminal RNA","similar NA structure","descriptor-variability","H1N1 swine flu sequences","H5N1 strains","terminal end","identified terminal segment","conserved surface residues","probable site","catalytic site","C-terminal","block level variability","D crystallographic structure","predicted secondary structure","protein sequence descriptor","RNA double hairpin secondary structure","D graphical representation model","GSWM","Graphical Sliding Window Method","different strains","active site","body region","stretch","single amino acid position variability results","recent reports of oseltamivir resistant strains","increased average solvent accessibility","significant statistical correlation","probable role","amino acids","scan method","recent computational study","development of effective inhibitors","Catalytic activity of influenza neuraminidase","broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses","residue blocks","interspecies reassortment","infected cells","additional target sites","importance","visual evidence","elution of progeny virions","high rate of mutation","zanamivir","self-aggregation","future antiviral compounds","numerical analyses","structural chemistry","BACKGROUND","molecule","impact","ASA","biological processes","tetrameric stabilization","chemical environment","CONCLUSION","majority","time","Research","observation","base","paper","GenBank"],"language":"en"},

Due to the lack of response shown from fMLF, the existence of formyl peptide receptors (FPR) on ferret PMNs was investigated by evaluating FPR binding using flow cytometry. The receptor was not detected, implying that ferret neutrophils may lack FPR.

Guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (GTP)-dependent initiation on a legitimate template generates a stable replicative complex capable of elongation in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid, a powerful inhibitor of RNA\u2013protein interactions. On the contrary, initiation on an illegitimate template is GTP independent and does not result in the aurintricarboxylic-acid-resistant replicative complex. This article demonstrates that the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 termini of a legitimate template cooperate during and after the initiation step. Breach of the cooperation by dividing the template into fragments or by introducing point mutations at the 5\u2032 terminus reduces the rate and the yield of initiation, increases the GTP requirement, decreases the overall rate of template copying, and destabilizes the postinitiation replicative complex. These results revive the old idea of a functional circularity of legitimate Q\u03B2 replicase templates and complement the increasing body of evidence that functional circularity may be a common property of RNA templates directing the synthesis of either RNA or protein molecules.","publish_time":"2008-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ugarov, Victor I.; Chetverin, Alexander B.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c54d54bff674091c5524f2735569d0848395b5bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173182.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.03.074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18466922/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283608004075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283608004075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functional circularity of legitimate Q\u03B2 replicase templates","illegitimate template","RNA polymerase of bacteriophage Q\u03B2","Abstract Q\u03B2 replicase","overall rate of template","common property of RNA templates","dependent initiation","yield of initiation","initiation step","powerful inhibitor of RNA","resistant replicative complex","postinitiation replicative complex","aurintricarboxylic-acid","GTP requirement","GTP independent","stable replicative complex capable of elongation","presence of aurintricarboxylic acid","protein interactions","protein molecules","certain RNAs","variety of RNAs","synthesis","increasing body of evidence","old idea","terminus","fragments","triphosphate","point mutations","cooperation","Previous studies","results","Guanosine","termini","minute fraction","Breach","article"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, CD8\u002BT cells isolated from the spleens of mice inoculated intraperitoneally with MHV-JHM and restimulatedin vitroonly respond to the H-2Db-restricted epitope.

To determine whether these results represent a difference in epitope recognition between the spleen and CNS, secondary CTL assays were performed using spleen cells coated with peptides encompassing the CTL epitopes as stimulators. Under these conditions, both epitopes sensitized cells for lysis by spleen-derived CTLs, suggesting that both epitopes were recognized by splenic CD8\u002BT cells after infectionin vivo.Furthermore, limiting dilution analysis indicated that the precursor frequency of splenic CD8\u002BT cells specific for both the H-2Kb- and H-2Db-restricted epitopes were not significantly different. Thus, the results suggest thatin vitrostimulation of splenocytes specific for the H-2Kb-restricted epitope is inefficient after endogenous processing but that this inefficiency can be corrected if peptide is provided exogenously at sufficiently high concentrations. As a consequence, the results also show that cells responsive to both of the previously identified CNS-derived CD8\u002BT cell epitopes are present in the infected spleen at nearly the same frequency.","publish_time":"1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro, Raymond F.; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e699e438bfb69f8000218de4a10ca6f29ed68be.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296904158; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296904158","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spleen cells","Db-restricted epitopes","T cells specific","CTL epitopes","T cell epitopes","cells responsive","infected MC57 cells","MHV-JHM","infected spleen","Abstract CD8","epitope recognition","results","identified CNS-derived CD8","spleen-derived CTLs","precursor frequency of splenic CD8","strain JHM","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","secondary CTL assays","restricted encompassing amino acids","cell line","thatin vitrostimulation of splenocytes specific","S protein","spleens of mice","preferential recognition","splenocytes stimulatedin vitrowith","mouse hepatitis virus","endogenous processing","infectionin","peptides","central nervous system","C57Bl","difference","directex vivocytotoxicity assay","dilution analysis","inefficiency","stimulators","restimulatedin","contrast","surface","glycoprotein","report","conditions","high concentrations","consequence"],"language":"en"},

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giordano, Giulia; Blanchini, Franco; Bruno, Raffaele; Colaneri, Patrizio; Di Filippo, Alessandro; Di Matteo, Angela; Colaneri, Marta","journal":"Nat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2adcc24c3ec9a24f1b9e69987b8873b8098ab76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175834.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0883-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322102/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIDARTHE model","epidemic spread","new model","non-diagnosed individuals","social distancing","pandemic","contact tracing","Italy","infected individuals","global SARS-CoV","restrictive social-distancing measures","ongoing COVID","simulation results","stages of infection","termed SIDARTHE","widespread testing","possible scenarios of implementation","implementation of multiple population-wide strategies","case fatality rate","deaths of people","real data","misperceptions","confirmed cases","countermeasures","distinction","course","effective control strategy","ailing","severity","symptoms","delineation"],"language":"en"},

CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, which is an important mediator of leukocyte chemotaxis during the immune response. A deletion mutation (\u039432) in this gene interferes with the response of immune cells, impairing viral clearance. We evaluated the CCR5\u039432 polymorphism (rs333) in individuals of the Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. METHODS: A total of 330 subjects with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, evaluated at health services in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil between June 2009 and August 2010, were genotyped for the \u039432 deletion (rs333). The cases were classified according to the progression of infection into a group of hospitalized patients (n = 156) and a group of non-hospitalized patients (n = 174). RESULTS: No significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of the CCR5\u039432 polymorphism were observed between non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients (p = 0.289 and p = 0.431, respectively). CONCLUSION: The \u039432 deletion in the CCR5 gene is not associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the Brazilian admixed population.

Background Modern molecular techniques reveal new information on the role of respiratory viruses in community\u2010acquired pneumonia. In this study, we tried to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses and bacteria in patients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital. Methods Between April 2008 and April 2009, 408 adult patients (aged between 20 and 94 years) with community\u2010acquired pneumonia were tested for the presence of respiratory pathogens using bacterial cultures, real\u2010time PCR for viruses and bacteria, urinary antigen testing for Legionella and Pneumococci and serology for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens. Results Pathogens were identified in 263 (64\u00B75%) of the 408 patients. The most common single organisms in these 263 patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (22\u00B78%), Coxiella burnetii (6\u00B78%) and influenza A virus (3\u00B78%). Of the 263 patients detected with pathogens, 117 (44\u00B75%) patients were positive for one or more viral pathogens. Of these 117 patients, 52 (44\u00B74%) had no bacterial pathogen. Multiple virus infections (\u22652) were found in 16 patients. Conclusion In conclusion, respiratory viruses are frequently found in patients with CAP and may therefore play an important role in the aetiology of this disease.","publish_time":"2012-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huijskens, Elisabeth G.

However, the true value of the clinical and laboratory predictors of pediatric CAP still needs to be assessed. This prospective cohort study in three emergency departments enrolled 142 children with radiological pneumonia. Pneumonia with lung consolidation was the primary endpoint; complicated pneumonia (bacteremia, empyema, or pleural effusion) was the secondary endpoint. We showed that three clinical signs (unilateral hypoventilation, grunting, and absence of wheezing), elevated procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), negative nasopharyngeal viral PCR, or positive blood pneumococcal PCR (P-PCR) were significantly associated with both pneumonia with consolidation and complicated pneumonia. Children with negative clinical signs and low CRP values had a low probability of having pneumonia with consolidation (13%) or complicated pneumonia (6%). Associating the three clinical signs, CRP \u003E80 mg/L and a positive P-PCR ruled in the diagnosis of complicated pneumonia with a positive predictive value of 75%. Conclusion: A model incorporating clinical signs and laboratory markers can effectively assess the risk of having pneumonia. Children with negative clinical signs and low CRP are at a low risk of having pneumonia. For children with positive clinical signs and high CRP, a positive blood pneumococcal PCR can more accurately confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2017-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alcoba, Gabriel; Keitel, Kristina; Maspoli, Veronica; Lacroix, Laurence; Manzano, Sergio; Gehri, Mario; Tabin, Ren\u00E9; Gervaix, Alain; Galetto-Lacour, Annick","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e3462773aacc3a0ed8f93b65f26735d532fce23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474099/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-017-2913-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of pneumonia","radiological pneumonia","positive clinical signs","diagnosis of complicated pneumonia","negative clinical signs","positive P-PCR","children","positive blood pneumococcal PCR","low CRP values","high CRP","low risk","positive predictive value","low probability","negative nasopharyngeal viral PCR","laboratory markers","laboratory predictors of pediatric CAP","lung consolidation","laboratory findings typical of bacterial CAP","primary endpoint","absence of wheezing","secondary endpoint","true value","bacteremia","emergency departments","PCT","C-reactive protein","elevated procalcitonin","pleural effusion","empyema","model","prospective cohort study","antibiotics","unilateral hypoventilation","management of community","Conclusion","advocate","Recommendations"],"language":"en"},

The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site.

The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product.

Proteins involved in phosphate signaling are well studied and include kinases and phosphatases that catalyze opposing reactions regulating both structure and function of the cell. Kinomics is the study of kinases, phosphatases and their targets, and has been used to study the functional changes in numerous diseases and infectious diseases with aims to delineate the cellular functions affected. Identifying the phosphate signaling pathways changed by certain diseases or infections can lead to novel therapeutic targets. However, a daunting 518 putative protein kinase genes have been identified [2], indicating that this protein family is very large and complex.

As reported, astragalus polysaccharides (APS) have potential antiviral effects against several viruses; however, the antiviral effect of APS against IBV remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether APS had the potential to inhibit IBV infectionby utilizing several in vitro experimental approaches. To this end, the effect of APS on the replication of IBV was examined in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. Viral titers were calculated by using the plaque formation assay, and the cytotoxicity of APS was tested by utilizing a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The expression of viral mRNA and cytokine (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03B1) mRNA transcripts was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR(qRT-PCR). IBV titers in infected CEK cells treated with APS were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that APS inhibited IBV replication in vitro. We also found that the decreased viral replication after APS treatment was associated with reduced mRNA levels of the cytokines IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03B1.

The SP\u2010PCR microdevice would be versatilely applied in PON testing as a universal platform for the fast identification of foodborne pathogens and environmentally threatening biogenic targets.","publish_time":"2018-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pham, Quang Nghia; Trinh, Kieu The Loan; Jung, Seung Won; Lee, Nae Yoon","journal":"Biotechnol Bioeng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ca81f458426644a5a496829626d96798a910233.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161830.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.26734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PON"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["SP","PCR microdevice","microchambers","chip microdevice","polycarbonate microdevice","immobilized forward primers","reverse primers","fluorescence detection","fast identification of foodborne pathogens","diffusing fluorescence","detection functionalities","PON testing","DNA analyses","integration of DNA amplification","phase polymerase chain reaction","South Korea","harmful algal blooms","universal platform","immobilizing amine","thermal bonding","reservoirs","threatening biogenic targets","Staphylococcus aureus","glutaraldehyde","polyethyleneimine","need","Salmonella","direct identifications","point","Cochlodinium polykrikoides","lab","target amplicons"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the effects of PEDV infection on the cell cycle of Vero cells and p53 activation. The results demonstrated that PEDV infection induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in Vero cells, while UV-inactivated PEDV does not cause cell cycle arrest. PEDV infection up-regulates the levels of p21, cdc2, cdk2, cdk4, Cyclin A protein and down-regulates Cyclin E protein. Further research results showed that inhibition of p53 signaling pathway can reverse the cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase induced by PEDV infection and cancel out the up-regulation of p21 and corresponding Cyclin/cdk mentioned above. In addition, PEDV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral subgenomic RNA and virus titer were higher in the cells released from G0/G1 phase synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G1/S phase and G2/M phase synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i..

The incidence of hypozincemia (serum or plasma zinc concentration \u003C0.71 \u00B5g/ml) of the two communities when combined was 24.4%, while hypercupremia (defined as serum or plasma copper levels greater than 1.38 \u00B5g/ml) was 47.9%. Depressed serum iron levels were demonstrated in more than 50% of the Aborigines studied. Hypozincemia was most prevalent (incidence 31 to 67%) in children at the time of the important pre- and postadolescent growth period (10 to 15 years) and in women beyond 60 years of age (incidence 33 to 64%). Serum total protein and vitamin B(12) levels tended to be increased. Mild anemia was seen in approximately one in five persons aged less than 20 years. Intestinal parasites and pathogenic enterobacteria were frequently isolated in fecal specimens. In one community, half of the persons examined had positive isolates of enteric pathogens. Intestinal parasites predominated and were more frequently isolated from persons aged less than 20 years. Ancylostoma duodenale accounted for 32% of the pathogens isolated. Evidence is presented that suggests that both communities are exposed to numerous bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. The diet consumed in these communities is predominately white flour and refined sugar. Geophagia is practiced in this area of Australia.

PARV4 and human bocavirus (HBoV) are newly discovered human parvoviruses with poorly understood epidemiologies and disease associations. We investigated the frequencies of persistence, tissue distribution, and influence of immunosuppression on replication of these viruses. Methods. At autopsy, bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, and brain tissue from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2014infected individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and those without AIDS and from HIV-uninfected individuals were screened for parvovirus B19, PARV4, and HBoV DNA by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Results. B19 DNA was detected both in HIV-infected study subjects (13 of 24) and in HIV-uninfected study subjects (8 of 8), whereas PARV4 DNA was detected only in HIV-infected study subjects (17 of 24). HBoV DNA was not detected in any study subjects. The degree of immunosuppression with HIV infection did not influence B19 or PARV4 viral loads. B19 or PARV4 plasma viremia was not detected in any study subjects (n = 76; viral load \u003C25 DNA copies/mL). A significantly older age distribution was found for study subjects infected with B19 genotype 2, compared with those infected with B19 genotype 1.

The overall goal of the operational instructions is to guarantee, during the current health emergency, the provision of the best health care possible, taking into account both public health necessities and the safety of procedures. These instructions could represent a useful resource to mental health providers, and stakeholders to face the current pandemic for which most of Mental Health Departments worldwide are not prepared to. These instructions could provide guidance and offer practical tools which can enable professionals and decision makers to foresee challenges, like those already experienced in Italy, which in part can be avoided or minimised if timely planned.

The PRRSV-encoded nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) is a nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) that is conserved throughout the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families. Previously, our research and that of others demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production through NendoU activity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we found that PRRSV nsp11 also inhibited IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity and subsequent transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Detailed analysis showed that nsp11 targeted interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), but not transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) or STAT2, key molecules in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Furthermore, the nsp11-IRF9 interaction impaired the formation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) in both nsp11-overexpressed and PRRSV-infected cells. Importantly, nsp11 mutations (H129A, H144A, and K173A) that ablate NendoU activity or its cell cytotoxicity also interacted with IRF9 and retained the ability to block IFN signaling, indicating that the nsp11-IRF9 interaction is independent of NendoU activity or cell cytotoxicity of nsp11. Taking the results together, our study demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 antagonizes type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9 via a NendoU activity-independent mechanism, and this report describes a novel strategy evolved by PRRSV to counteract host innate antiviral responses, revealing a potential new function for PRRSV nsp11 in type I IFN signaling. IMPORTANCE The nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) encoded by PRRSV nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) is a unique NendoU of nidoviruses that infect vertebrates; thus, it is an attractive target for the development of antinidovirus drugs. Previous studies have revealed that the NendoU of nidoviruses, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), acts as a type I interferon (IFN) antagonist. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that overexpression of PRRSV nsp11 also inhibits IFN signaling by targeting the C-terminal interferon regulatory factor (IRF) association domain of IRF9. This interaction impaired the ability of IRF9 to form the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and to act as a signaling protein of IFN signaling. Collectively, our data identify IRF9 as a natural target of PRRSV NendoU and reveal a novel mechanism evolved by an arterivirus to counteract innate immune signaling.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Dang; Chen, Jiyao; Yu, Chaoliang; Zhu, Xinyu; Xu, Shangen; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbc6fcee006fd6fe5719f4f33ff26ef3f763b6e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6639278.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00623-19; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/15/e00623-19.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092569/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overexpression of PRRSV nsp11","nsp11-IRF9 interaction","protein of IFN","nsp11-overexpressed","nsp11 mutations","natural target of PRRSV NendoU","subsequent transcription of IFN","cell cytotoxicity of nsp11","PRRSV nonstructural protein","independent of NendoU activity","nsp11 targeted interferon regulatory factor","transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor","type","ability of IRF9","PRRSV-infected cells","IFN-stimulated response element","NendoU activity-independent mechanism","NendoU activity-dependent mechanisms","unique NendoU of nidoviruses","association domain of IRF9","promoter activity","C-terminal interferon regulatory factor","stimulated genes","activator of transcription","respiratory syndrome virus","reproductive failure","respiratory disease","arterivirus","nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease","ISGF3","novel mechanism","attractive target","novel strategy","innate immune","ISRE","nuclear translocation","production","potential new function","pigs","formation","constant threat","antiviral responses","human coronavirus","STAT1","HCoV","STAT2","key molecules","Nidovirales order","Detailed analysis","global pig industry","report","host","H129A","H144A","K173A","acts","study","development of antinidovirus drugs","IMPORTANCE","data","vertebrates","transducer","ISGs","antagonist","Arteriviridae","Coronaviridae families","Previous studies","pathway","results","time","research"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and nelfinavir effectively inhibited FCoV replication. When the amount of virus preinoculated into the test cells was increased to mimic the high viral load present in the target cells of FIP cats, GNA and nelfinavir by themselves lost their inhibitory effect. However, when the two agents were added together to FCoV-infected cells, a synergistic antiviral effect defined by complete blockage of viral replication was observed.

This includes the formation of stress granules (SG) that sequester translationally-stalled cellular transcripts, translation initiation factors, ribosomal proteins, and RNA binding proteins until conditions improve and translation can resume. Work by others suggests that these cellular stress responses, which are part of the integrated stress response, may benefit rather than repress reovirus replication. In agreement with this, we report that stressing cells prior to infection with sodium arsenite (SA), a robust inducer of SG and activator of eIF2\u03B1 kinases, enhanced viral protein expression, percent infectivity and viral titer in SA-treated cells compared to untreated cells. SA-mediated enhancement of reovirus replication was not strain-specific, but was cell-type specific. While pre-treatment of cells with SA offered the greatest enhancement, treatment of infected cultures as late as 4 h post infection resulted in an increase in the percent of cells infected. SA activates the HRI kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2\u03B1 and subsequently induces SG formation. Other stresses, such as heat shock (HS) and osmotic shock also activate HRI. Heat shock of cells prior to reovirus infection readily induced SG in greater than 85% of cells. Although HS pre-treatment had no effect on the percentage of infected cells or viral yield, it did enhance viral protein expression. These data suggest that SA pre-treatment perturbs the cell in a way that is beneficial for reovirus and that neither HRI activation nor SG induction is sufficient for reovirus infection enhancement. All viruses rely on the host translational machinery for the synthesis of viral proteins. In response to viral infection, cells activate the integrated stress response resulting in the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 and translation shutoff. Despite this, reovirus replicates to reduced titers in the absence of this response. In this work, we report that sodium arsenite activation of the integrated stress response prior to virus inoculation enhances virus infectivity, protein expression and titer. Together, these data suggest that modulation of conserved cellular stress responses can alter reovirus replication.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lutz, Michael M.; Worth, Megan P.; Hinchman, Meleana M.; Parker, John S.

METHODS: All the consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Fuyang second people\u2019s hospital or the fifth medical center of Chinese PLA general hospital between January 20 and February 22, 2020, were enrolled and their clinical data were retrospectively collected. Multivariate COX regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with progression, and then were incorporated into the nomogram to establish a novel prediction scoring model. ROC was used to assess the performance of the novel model. RESULTS: Overall, 208 patients were divided into stable group (n=168, 80.8%) and progressive group (n=40,19.2%) based on whether their conditions worsened during the hospitalization Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte and higher lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent high-risk factors for COVID-19 progression. Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.86 (95%CI 0.81 - 0.91), and had well-fitted calibration curves. A novel scoring model, named as CALL, was established, and its area under ROC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Using a cutoff value of 6 points, the positive and negative predictive values were 50.7% (38.9% - 62.4%) and 98.5% (94.7% - 99.8%), respectively.

As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3\u2032 end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3\u2032-M-F-5\u2032. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3\u2032-M-SH-G-F-5\u2032, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3\u2032-M-F-5\u2032. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5\u2032 ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5\u2032 end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3\u0027-M-F-5\u2032. The 5\u2032 termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.","publish_time":"1992-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Q.; Davis, P.

According to this simulation, the annual GHG emissions reduction and the annual electricity exported to the grid for 20 kW and 1 MW PV power plants are 22.06 tCO(2), 1103 tCO(2), 39 MWh, and 1953 MWh, respectively. From the economic outlook, based on the new feed-in tariff for power plants and the supposed initial costs, the payback period for the initial investments are between 3 and 4, and 5 years for 20 kW and 1 MW PV power plants, respectively.","publish_time":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farangi, Mostafa; Asl Soleimani, Ebrahim; Zahedifar, Mostafa; Amiri, Omid; Poursafar, Jafar","journal":"Energy (Oxf)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7e611c245de1926f18188196ff8baa56d2c32d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196319.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.117771; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360544220308781; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544220308781?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367905/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["MW PV power plants","energy outlook","MW grid","renewable energy resources","annual GHG emissions reduction","annual electricity","high solar energy","payback period","Iran","comprehensive survey","economic outlook","initial investments","tCO","MWh","supposed initial costs","prominent policies","supporting policies","economic aspects","updated survey","clear simulation","recent years","net greenhouse gases","country\u2019s background","RETScreen software","authorities","tariff","new feed","cumulative cash flows","potential","perspective","work"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a rapid detection assay is imperative for BEFV diagnosis. In this study, we described the development of lateral-flow dipstick isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (LFD-RPA) assays for detection of BEFV. RPA primers and LF probes were designed by targeting the specific G gene, and the amplification product can be visualized on a simple lateral flow dipstick with the naked eyes. The amplification reaction was performed at 38 \u00B0C for 20 min and LFD incubation time within 5 min. The detection limit of this assay was 8 copies per reaction, and there was no cross-reactivity with other bovine infectious viruses such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, the assay was performed with total 128 clinical specimens and the diagnostic results were compared with conventional RT-PCR, real-time quantative(q) PCR. The result showed that the coincidence rate of BEFV LFD-RPA and real-time qPCR was 96.09% (123/128), which was higher than conventional RT-PCR.

The ability of the ribosome to change translational reading frames in the \u22121 direction (\u22121 PRF) is employed by many positive strand RNA viruses, including economically important plant viruses and many human pathogens such as retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, and coronaviruses, e.g., the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in order to properly express their genomes. \u22121 PRF is programmed by a bipartite signal embedded in the mRNA and includes a heptanucleotide \u201Cslip site\u201D over which the paused ribosome \u201Cbacks up\u201D by one nucleotide, and a downstream stimulatory element, either an RNA pseudoknot or a very stable RNA stem-loop. These two elements are separated by 6\u20138 nucleotides, a distance that places the 5\u2032 edge of the downstream stimulatory element in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the 30S ribosomal subunit. The precise mechanism by which the downstream RNA stimulates \u22121 PRF by the translocating ribosome remains unclear.

Support for the hypothesis that the downstream stimulatory element provides a kinetic barrier to the ribosome mediated unfolding is discussed.","publish_time":"2009-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giedroc, David P.; Cornish, Peter V.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5307ab57d5733bc587d3dbe89e5d8e1b944f3670.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8564d7cbfda048c6d49998aa429fdca06a2d9b26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2670756.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170208002323; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2670756?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170208002323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18621088/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["downstream RNA","PRF","messenger RNA","downstream stimulatory element","translocating ribosome","elongating ribosome","paused ribosome","positive strand RNA viruses","ribosome mediated unfolding","biophysical studies of RNA pseudoknots","stable RNA stem-loop","places","ribosomal frameshifting","important plant viruses","mRNA entry channel","translational reading frames","S ribosomal subunit","multiple translational recoding processes","direct contact","kinetic barrier","causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","human pathogens","triplet","evolving mechanistic understanding of translation elongation","context","edge","hypothesis","retroviruses","order","coronaviruses","review","direction","site","bipartite signal","precise mechanism","HIV","distance","heptanucleotide","Support","ability","nucleotides","genomes","elements"],"language":"en"},

However, the underlying cellular mechanisms that regulate expression of IL-10 in different T cell subpopulations are not yet fully elucidated. We recently showed that TNF inhibitors (TNFi) promote IL-10 expression in human CD4(\u002B) T cells, including IL-17(\u002B) CD4(\u002B) T cells. Here, we further characterized the regulation of IL-10 expression via blockade of TNF signaling or other cytokine/co-stimulatory pathways, in human T cell subpopulations. Addition of the TNFi drug adalimumab to anti-CD3-stimulated human CD4(\u002B) T cell/monocyte cocultures led to increased percentages of IL-10(\u002B) cells in pro-inflammatory IL-17(\u002B), IFN\u03B3(\u002B), TNF\u03B1(\u002B), GM-CSF(\u002B), and IL-4(\u002B) CD4(\u002B) T cell subpopulations. Conversely, exogenous TNF\u03B1 strongly decreased IL-10(\u002B) cell frequencies. TNF blockade also regulated IL-10 expression in CD4(\u002B) T cells upon antigenic stimulation. Using time course experiments in whole peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, we show that TNF blockade maintained, rather than increased, IL-10(\u002B) cell frequencies in both CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells following in vitro stimulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Blockade of IL-17, IFN\u03B3, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation did not significantly regulate IL-10 expression within CD4(\u002B) or CD8(\u002B) T cell subpopulations. We show that TNF blockade acts directly on effector CD4(\u002B) T cells, in the absence of monocytes or CD4(\u002B) CD25(high)CD127(low) regulatory T cells and independently of IL-27, resulting in higher IL-10(\u002B) frequencies after 3 days in culture. IL-10/IL-10R blockade reduced the frequency of IL-10-expressing cells both in the presence and absence of TNF blockade. Addition of recombinant IL-10 alone was insufficient to drive an increase in IL-10(\u002B) CD4(\u002B) T cell frequencies in 3-day CD4(\u002B) T cell/monocyte cocultures, but resulted in increased IL-10 expression at later time points in whole PBMC cultures. Together, these data provide additional insights into the regulation of IL-10 expression in human T cells by TNF blockade. The maintenance of an IL-10(\u002B) phenotype across a broad range of effector T cell subsets may represent an underappreciated mechanism of action underlying this widely used therapeutic strategy.","publish_time":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roberts, Ceri A.; Durham, Lucy E.; Fleskens, Veerle; Evans, Hayley G.; Taams, Leonie S.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0afcaab27d3532f3396316eb529468097bd6de7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5309392.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28261215/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF","GM","PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of IL","Blockade of IL","increased IL","regulation of IL","frequency of IL","higher IL","T cell frequencies","human T cells","human T cell subpopulations","increased percentages of IL","effector T cell subpopulations","regulatory T cells","anti-inflammatory cytokine IL","Addition of recombinant IL","pro-inflammatory IL","different T cell subpopulations","effector CD4","blockade of TNF","day CD4","broad range of effector T cell subsets","absence of TNF blockade","R blockade","TNF inhibitors","anti-CD3-stimulated human CD4","peripheral blood mononuclear cell","co-stimulation","PBMC cultures","monocyte cocultures","antigenic stimulation","IFN\u03B3","later time points","time course experiments","time-dependent manner","regulatory potential","absence of monocytes","exogenous TNF\u03B1","co-stimulatory pathways","TNFi drug adalimumab","underlying cellular mechanisms","CD127","CD25","dose","CD80","underappreciated mechanism of action","CD86","additional insights","phenotype","presence","data","therapeutic strategy","days","GM-CSF","maintenance"],"language":"en"},

The psychiatric consultant is often asked to evaluate a patient\u0027s ability to accept or refuse treatment, and then make a determination of capacity. When the patient cannot give informed consent, an alternate decision maker must be found. Finally, malpractice liability is often a concern for the psychiatric consultant. Overall, psychiatrists should approach the care of patients foremost from a clinical perspective, while understanding the applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they practice.

Some plants and probiotic strains could give a better protection to our organism by strengthening the immune system. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this preliminary survey was to evaluate the possible preventive effect against infections of Cupressus sempervirens/Echinacea purpurea combination (plants known for their immune and anti-viral effects) in association with probiotics during the winter season. METHODS: It\u2019s a declarative survey by questionnaire. The objective was to compare the occurrence of winter infections in two populations aged 18\u201365 years old in good health which used this complementation for at least 3 months period during winter period or not. RESULTS: The rate of incidence of flu (P = 0.012), common cold (P = 0.002) and throat infection (P = 0.0017) decreased in the group that took complementation compared to the group that didn\u2019t take complementation. The occurrence of colds was also significantly reduced in a subgroup of subjects that are more sensitive to infections during winter and took the complementation compared to the same subgroup of subjects that didn\u2019t take the complementation (36 vs 78% of colds, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that consumption of both products for 3 months or more is associated to a lesser incidence of winter infections such as flu, cold and throat infection.

Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a microfluidic flow cell, the hemifusion of single virions is visualized. Hemifusion efficiency and kinetics are studied while altering target bilayer cholesterol content and sialic-acid donor. Cholesterol ratios tested were 0%, 10%, 20%, and 40%. Sialic-acid donors GD1a and GYPA were used. Both cholesterol ratio and sialic-acid donors proved to have a significant effect on hemifusion efficiency. Furthermore, comparison between GD1a and GYPA conditions shows that the cholesterol dependence of the hemifusion time is severely affected by the sialic-acid donor. Only GD1a shows a clear increasing trend in hemifusion efficiency and time with increasing cholesterol concentration of the target bilayer with maximum rates for GD1A and 40% cholesterol.

In this work we employ the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate the adsorption of RNA onto positively charged spherical viral shells and examine the conditions when GSDA does not apply and SCFT has to be used to obtain a reliable solution. We find that there are two regimes in which GSDA does work. First, when the genomic RNA length is long enough compared to the capsid radius, and second, when the interaction between the genome and capsid is so strong that the genome is basically localized next to the wall. We find that for the case in which RNA is more or less distributed uniformly in the shell, regardless of the length of RNA, GSDA is not a good approximation. We observe that as the polymer\u2013shell interaction becomes stronger, the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state increases and thus GSDA becomes a better approximation. We also present our results corresponding to the genome persistence length obtained through the tangent\u2013tangent correlation length and show that it is zero in case of GSDA but is equal to the inverse of the energy gap when using SCFT.","publish_time":"2018-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Siyu; Orland, Henri; Zandi, Roya","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ead0042acffd1db712e53a3fba8c924e9b10fd9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GSDA","SCFT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["length of RNA","case of GSDA","genomic RNA length","SCFT","genome persistence length","adsorption of RNA","tangent correlation length","ground state dominance approximation","energy gap","shell interaction","better approximation","good approximation","work","excited state increases","spherical viral shells","assembly of viral shells","capsid radius","self-consistent field theory","conditions","inverse","polymer","results","reliable solution","wall","regimes"],"language":"en"},

We established sensitive methods of REV detection, including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for REV-LTR and REV-gag genes, REV antigenemia measurements by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and virus isolation in tissue cultures. A variety of blood-sucking species of insects were trapped at farms with infected poultry and tested, but none were positive. To rule out the possibility of PCR inhibition by insect RNA, spiking experiments were conducted and no interference was observed. Because Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were trapped frequently at farms, we performed feeding experiments with mosquito females fed on a REV-containing tissue culture medium and chicken blood mixture. Virus was detected in the mosquitoes up to 5 h postfeeding, compared with 96 h in the feeding mixture, indicating that Cx. pipiens can only harbor REV for a short period. House flies were suspected to be involved in the virus transmission because they frequently were trapped on positive farms. In contrast to mosquitoes, REV was harbored within the house fly digestive tract for up to 72 h and could infect chickens, as demonstrated by seroconversion and by detection of viral gag-sequence in the cloaca. The current study is supportive for the role of house flies as a mechanical vector of REV among poultry.","publish_time":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davidson, Irit; Braverman, Yehuda","journal":"J Med Entomol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afd2d43ec2ecb7358f841b6304cbb011fd625928.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107493.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["House"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["REV-LTR","REV-gag genes","mosquitoes","REV antigenemia measurements","mechanical vector of REV","sensitive methods of REV detection","virus transmission","positive farms","role of house flies","feeding mixture","commercial farms","virus isolation","Reticuloendotheliosis virus","controlled feeding experiments","spiking experiments","testing insects","species of insects","involvement of insects","h postfeeding","Cx","chicken blood mixture","detection of viral gag-sequence","tissue cultures","variety of blood","infected poultry","tissue culture medium","possibility of PCR inhibition","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","insect RNA","Culex","Musca domestica","seroconversion","mosquito females","current study","cloaca","digestive tract","chickens","interference","short period","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Relevant information about host factors was abstracted from the medical records. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the major risk factors for superspreading events. Results. Eighty-six wards in 21 hospitals in Guangzhou and 38 wards in 5 hospitals in Hong Kong were included in the study. Six risk factors were significant in the final multiple-logistic regression model: minimum distance between beds of \u22641 m (odds ratio [OR], 6.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68\u201328.75), availability of washing or changing facilities for staff (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02\u20130.97), whether resuscitation was ever performed in the ward (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.04\u201313.87), whether staff members worked while experiencing symptoms (OR, 10.55; 95% CI, 2.28\u201348.87), whether any host patients (index patient or the first patient with SARS admitted to a ward) required oxygen therapy (OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.00\u201318.43), and whether any host patients required bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (OR, 11.82; 95% CI, 1.97\u201370.80). Conclusions. Our results revealed that factors that were associated with the ward environment and administration were important in nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. The lessons learned from this study remain very important and highly relevant to the daily operation of hospital wards if we are to prevent nosocomial outbreaks of other respiratory infections in the future.","publish_time":"2007-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Ignatius T.; Xie, Zhan Hong; Tsoi, Kelvin K.; Chiu, Yuk Lan; Lok, Siu Wai; Tang, Xiao Ping; Hui, David S.; Lee, Nelson; Li, Yi Min; Huang, Zhi Tong; Liu, Tao; Wong, Tze Wai; Zhong, Nan Shan; Sung, Joseph J.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1725095da9b98a103e578c444cca117be2a7346d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107862.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzczNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","China","Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["control wards","Case wards","Eighty-six wards","nosocomial outbreaks of SARS","host factors","superspreading events of SARS","daily operation of hospital wards","administrative factors","major risk factors","host patients","hospitals","subsequent nosocomial outbreaks","ward managers","ward environment","case-control study","Guangzhou","Hong Kong","Relevant information","Results","Logistic regression analyses","respiratory infections","index patient","staff members","final multiple-logistic regression model","severe acute respiratory syndrome","interviews","bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation","minimum distance","beds","administration","nursing officers","visits","facilities","underlying causes","China","availability of washing","medical records","symptoms","future","oxygen therapy","confidence interval","odds ratio","lessons","resuscitation","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The test-negative control study design is the basis for observational studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Recent studies have suggested that influenza vaccination increases the risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection. Such an effect could create bias in VE studies using influenza-negative controls. We investigated the association between influenza infection, vaccination, and detection of other respiratory viruses among children \u003C5 years old and adults \u226550 years old with acute respiratory illness who participated in seasonal studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness. Methods. Nasal/nasopharyngeal samples collected from 2004\u20132005 through 2009\u20132010 were tested for 19 respiratory virus targets using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) platform. Vaccination status was determined using a validated registry. Adjusted odds ratios for influenza and vaccination status were calculated using three different control groups: influenza-negative, other respiratory virus positive, and pan-negative. Results. Influenza was detected in 12% of 2010 children and 20% of 1738 adults. Noninfluenza respiratory viruses were detected in 70% of children and 38% of adults without influenza. The proportion vaccinated did not vary between virus-positive controls and pan-negative controls in children (P = .62) or adults (P = .33). Influenza infection was associated with reduced odds of vaccination, but adjusted odds ratios differed by no more than 0.02 when the analysis used influenza-negative or virus-positive controls. Conclusions. Influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses. Use of influenza-negative controls did not generate a biased estimate of vaccine effectiveness due to an effect of vaccination on other respiratory virus infections.","publish_time":"2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sundaram, Maria E.; McClure, David L.; VanWormer, Jeffrey J.; Friedrich, Thomas C.; Meece, Jennifer K.; Belongia, Edward A.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1a916348aef3fba12f89112c5f0d02c562974a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107973.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza vaccination","influenza-negative controls","influenza infection","respiratory virus positive","respiratory virus targets","respiratory virus infections","observational studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness","seasonal studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness","pan-negative controls","virus-positive controls","Vaccination status","effect of vaccination","risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection","detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses","children","adults","reduced odds of vaccination","acute respiratory illness","VE studies","Recent studies","test-negative control study design","Adjusted odds ratios","years old","biased estimate of vaccine effectiveness","different control groups","basis","multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","platform","association","analysis","validated registry","Nasal","nasopharyngeal samples","proportion","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, we investigated the antigenicity of different regions of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein. Methods: The cDNA for full-length N protein and its various regions from the SARS-CoV was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. After purification, all of the protein fragments were printed on glass slides to fabricate a protein microarray and then probed with the sera from SARS patients to determine the reactivity of these protein fragments. Results: The full-length protein and two other fragments reacted with all 52 sera tested. Four important regions with possible epitopes were identified and named as EP1 (amino acids 51\u201371), EP2 (134\u2013208), EP3 (249\u2013273), and EP4 (349\u2013422), respectively. EP2 and EP4 possessed linear epitopes, whereas EP1 and EP2 were able to form conformational epitopes that could react with most (\u003E80%) of the tested sera. EP3 and EP4 also formed conformational epitopes, and antibodies against these epitopes existed in all 52 of the sera tested. Conclusion: The N protein is a highly immunogenic protein of the SARS-CoV. Conformational epitopes are important for this protein, and antigenicity of the COOH terminus is higher than that of the NH(2) terminus.

We describe the clinical and virologic features of URIs that remain uncomplicated and those that precede an episode of sinusitis. We hypothesize that certain viruses are more likely to lead to acute sinusitis, and we compare viruses identified at the time of diagnosis of sinusitis with those identified early in the URI. METHODS: Children aged 48\u201396 months were followed longitudinally for 1 year. Nasal samples were obtained at surveillance visits, on Day 3\u20134 of the URI, and on Day 10, when sinusitis was diagnosed. Molecular diagnostic testing was performed on nasal washes for common respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria. A standardized score was used to quantify symptom severity. RESULTS: We evaluated 519 URIs, and 37 illnesses in 31 patients met the criteria for sinusitis. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected more frequently in URI visits that led to sinusitis, compared to in uncomplicated URIs (10.8% vs 3.4%; P = .05). New viruses were detected in 29% of sinusitis episodes, and their pattern was different than those patterns observed at surveillance. The median number of URIs per subject per year was 1 (range 0\u20139) in uncomplicated URI subjects and 3 (range 1\u20139) in sinusitis subjects (P \u003C .001). CONCLUSIONS: Children who developed sinusitis experienced more frequent URIs, compared to children whose URIs remained uncomplicated. When nasal samples were obtained on the day of diagnosis of acute sinusitis, nearly 30% of children had a new virus identified, suggesting that some children deemed to have sinusitis were experiencing sequential viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeMuri, Gregory P; Eickhoff, Jens C; Gern, James C; Wald, Ellen R","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e678b6aa4754217a96354c9731af1bd91fd9ef2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108184.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["URI"],"keyphrases":["acute sinusitis","sinusitis subjects","sinusitis episodes","episode of sinusitis","Acute bacterial sinusitis","uncomplicated URIs","Children","frequent URIs","uncomplicated URI subjects","URI visits","New viruses","common respiratory viruses","virologic features of URIs","median number of URIs","Nasal samples","day of diagnosis","certain viruses","nasal washes","Respiratory syncytial virus","range","surveillance visits","year","frequent complication of viral upper respiratory infection","time of diagnosis","sequential viral infections","pathogenic bacteria","Molecular diagnostic testing","patterns","illnesses","patients","criteria","BACKGROUND","vs","standardized score","symptom severity","months","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Community studies have shown that \u223C30% of patients with acute respiratory tract symptoms have no identifiable infective aetiology. This may not be applicable in general practice. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the infective aetiology in patients who presented to primary care doctors with acute respiratory symptoms. Methods. A prospective study was carried out in all nine primary care clinics belonging to the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGPs) in Singapore. The subjects comprised 594 consecutive patients (318 males, 276 females) aged \u226521 years who presented with complaints of any one of cough, nasal or throat symptoms of \u003C7 days duration. Data collection was through interview using structured questionnaire, physical examination, throat swabs for bacterial culture and nasal swabs for virus identification by immunofluorescence (IF) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additional PCR was performed on a subsample of 100 patients. Patients were followed-up until resolution of symptoms. Results. The aetiological diagnosis by infective agent is as follows: 150 patients (25.2%) had virus infections, of which 90.7% (136/150) were by rhinovirus. Fourteen patients (2.4%) had bacterial infections, of which 10 were due to group G streptococcus. Group A streptococcus was not detected. Nineteen patients with new pathogens were identified by further PCR. These included parainfluenza 4, human coronavirus OC43, adenovirus, enterovirus and Chlamydia pneumoniae. No pathogen could be identified in 49% of patients. There were no differences in clinical presentation and socio-demographic variables between patients who had viral infections and those in whom no pathogen could be identified. Conclusion. In about half of patients who presented at NHGPs, no pathogens could be identified even after PCR. A non-infective aetiology could be considered in these patients.","publish_time":"2004-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Ching-Ye; Lin, Raymond TP; Tan, Elaine SL; Chong, Phui-Nah; Tan, Yvette SL; Lew, Yii-Jen; Loo, Liat-Hui","journal":"Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67753a8214a7b8bf872af70ea1175c3496d0bf30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108456.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["consecutive patients","half of patients","throat symptoms","acute respiratory symptoms","identifiable infective aetiology","non-infective aetiology","resolution of symptoms","infective agent","bacterial infections","virus infections","Additional PCR","acute respiratory tract symptoms","throat swabs","nasal swabs","NHGPs","viral infections","group G streptococcus","primary care doctors","primary care clinics","bacterial culture","National Healthcare Group Polyclinics","virus identification","new pathogens","prospective study","physical examination","structured questionnaire","human coronavirus OC43","socio-demographic variables","adenovirus","enterovirus","interview","immunofluorescence","clinical presentation","included parainfluenza","cough","polymerase chain reaction","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Data collection","differences","aetiological diagnosis","Singapore","females","days duration","subsample","general practice","years","complaints","subjects","Community studies","purpose","Background","Objective","Methods","Results","rhinovirus","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Microarray detection is a good method, but requires complex procedures for multiple virus detection. Methods: We developed a novel PCR assay, the microarray-in-a-tube system, which integrates multiple PCR processes and DNA microarrays for multiple virus detection. A 5 \u00D7 5 oligonucleotide microarray for detecting 4 respiratory tract viruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and enterovirus) with inner controls was arranged on the inner surface of a specially designed Eppendorf cap with a flat, optically transparent window. Results: We were able to perform all detection processes in the encapsulated system without opening the cap. The 4 viruses were successfully amplified by one-step reverse transcription\u2013PCR in the encapsulated tube. After the PCR process, the microarray-in-a-tube was inverted, and the fluorescence-labeled PCR products were directly hybridized on the microarray. Hybridization signals were obtained with an ordinary fluorescent microscope. The sensitivity of the system for virus detection reached 10(2) copies/\u03BCL. With the help of inner controls, the system provided reliable results without false negatives and false positives. Conclusions: The microarray-in-a-tube system is a rapid, labor-saving tool for multiple virus detection with several advantages, such as convenience, prevention of cross-contamination of the PCR products, and potential for multiple-gene detection.","publish_time":"2007-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Quanjun; Bai, Yunfei; Ge, Qinyu; Zhou, Shixin; Wen, Tian; Lu, Zuhong","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be92e0e061df1c017528a5e95977957a35b74e0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Microarray detection","multiple virus detection","detection of multiple viruses","multiple-gene detection","detection processes","multiple PCR processes","tube system","PCR products","encapsulated system","oligonucleotide microarray","influenza B virus","encapsulated tube","novel PCR assay","respiratory tract viruses","inner surface","help of inner controls","false negatives","false positives","reliable results","severe acute respiratory syndrome","associated coronavirus","DNA microarrays","labor-saving tool","pathogenic diagnosis","complex procedures","designed Eppendorf cap","contamination","good method","enterovirus","advantages","potential","one-step reverse transcription","prevention of cross","convenience","disease control","ordinary fluorescent microscope","fluorescence","Background","sensitivity","Hybridization signals","transparent window","Methods","copies","\u03BCL","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

However, rodent models are limited by several important physiological and metabolic differences from humans, and many rodent models do not dependably replicate the clinical manifestations of human diseases. Due to the high degree of similarity in anatomy, physiology, immunology and brain growth, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa) is considered a clinically relevant model to study factors influencing human gastrointestinal, immune, and brain development. Gnotobiotic piglet models have been developed and shown to recapitulate key aspects of GN rodent models. Human microbiota-associated (HMA) piglets have been established using inocula from infants, children, and adults. The gut microbiota of recipient HMA piglets was more similar to that of the human donor than that of conventionally reared piglets harboring a pig microbiota. Moreover, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, two predominant bacterial groups of infant gut, were successfully established in the HMA piglets. Thus, the HMA pig model has the potential to be a valuable model for investigating how the gut microbiota composition changes in response to environmental factors, such as age, diet, vaccination, antibiotic use and infection. The HMA also represents a robust model for screening the efficacy of pre- and probiotic interventions. Lastly, HMA piglets can be an ideal model with which to elucidate microbe\u2013host interactions in human health and disease due to the similarities to humans in anatomy, physiology, developmental maturity at birth, and the pathophysiology of many human diseases.","publish_time":"2015-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Mei; Donovan, Sharon M.","journal":"ILAR J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdff8e313097cb18af06ae9b5a9fe307bf1d141b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108572/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GN","HMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human microbiota","HMA pig model","gut microbiota of recipient HMA piglets","human health","pig microbiota","human donor","relevant model","ideal model","valuable model","robust model","reared piglets","gut microbiota composition changes","Gnotobiotic piglet models","key aspects of GN rodent models","clinical manifestations of human diseases","anatomy","humans","domestic pig","predominant bacterial groups of infant gut","environmental factors","study factors","brain growth","brain development","host interactions","immunology","response","microbe","vaccination","diet","age","developmental maturity","similarities","insight","potential","antibiotic use","metabolic differences","efficacy of pre-","Bacteroides","birth","Sus scrofa","high degree of similarity","pathophysiology","contributions","infants","children","probiotic interventions","infection","Bifidobacterium","inocula","adults"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of the evidence indicates that while all of these theories are correct, exceptions to each can also be found. The biological roles of oligosaccharides appear to span the spectrum from those that are trivial, to those that are crucial for the development, growth, function or survival of an organism. Some general principles emerge. First, it is difficult to predict a priori the functions a given oligosaccharide on a given glycoconjugate might be mediating, or their relative importance to the organism. Second, the same oligosaccharide sequence may mediate different functions at different locations within the same organism, or at different times in its ontogeny or life cycle. Third, the more specific and crucial biological roles of oligosaccharides are often mediated by unusual oligosaccharide sequences, unusual presentations of common terminal sequences, or by further modifications of the sugars themselves. However, such oligosaccharide sequences are also more likely to be targets for recognition by pathogenic toxins and microorganisms. As such, they are subject to more intra- and inter-species variation because of ongoing host\u2014pathogen interactions during evolution. In the final analysis, the only common features of the varied functions of oligosaccharides are that they either mediate \u2018specific recognition\u2019 events or that they provide \u2018modulation\u2019 of biological processes. In so doing, they generate much of the functional diversity required for the development and differentiation of complex organisms, and for their interactions with other organisms in the environment.","publish_time":"1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Varki, Ajit","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["given oligosaccharide","different functions","unusual oligosaccharide sequences","crucial biological roles of oligosaccharides","different theories","different times","different locations","biological processes","varied functions of oligosaccharides","development","specific recognition","unusual presentations of common terminal sequences","oligosaccharide units of individual classes of glycoconjugates","common features","pathogen interactions","given glycoconjugate","final analysis","differentiation of complex organisms","ongoing host","inter-species variation","evolution","ontogeny","growth","survival","life cycle","pathogenic toxins","microorganisms","modifications","modulation","events","functional diversity","exceptions","relative importance","spectrum","environment","general principles","sugars","evidence"],"language":"en"},

They promote release of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). We explored mechanisms for this release and its inhibition by drugs. METHODS: IL-8 release from colon epithelial cells in response to mucosal E. coli isolates from IBD, colon cancer, and controls was characterized at the cellular and molecular level. RESULTS: IL-8 response of HT29 cells was greater with Crohn\u0027s disease (689 \u00B1 298 [mean \u00B1 SD] pg IL-8/mL at 4 hours, n = 7) and colon cancer isolates (532 \u00B1 415 pg/mL, n = 14) than with ulcerative colitis (236 \u00B1 58 pg/mL, n = 6) or control isolates (236 \u00B1 100 pg/mL, n = 6, P \u003C 0.0001). Bacterial supernatants contained shed flagellin that triggered IL-8 release. For whole bacteria the IL-8 response to E. coli that agglutinate red blood cells (548 \u00B1 428 pg IL-8/mL, n = 16), a function that correlates with epithelial invasion, was greater than for nonhemagglutinators (281 \u00B1 253 pg/mL, n = 17; P \u003C 0.0001). This was particularly marked among E. coli that, although flagellate, could not release IL-8 from TLR5-transfected HEK293 cells. IL-8 release was mediated by extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibited by mesalamine, but not hydrocortisone, at therapeutic concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosa-associated E. coli shed flagellin that elicits epithelial IL-8 release but this may only become relevant when the mucosal barrier is weakened to expose basolateral TLR5. Adherent and invasive IBD and colon cancer E. coli isolates also elicit a flagellin-independent IL-8 response that may be relevant when the mucosal barrier is intact. The IL-8 release is MAPK-dependent and inhibited by mesalamine.","publish_time":"2008-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramanian, Sreedhar; Rhodes, Jonathan M.; Hart, Anthony C.; Tam, Ben; Roberts, Carol L.; Smith, Shirley L.; Corkill, John E.; Winstanley, Craig; Virji, Mumtaz; Campbell, Barry J.","journal":"Inflamm Bowel Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3d7c160a58080b25da048ab095cd453e02f5527.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzkwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pg IL","release","epithelial IL","flagellin-independent IL","coli isolates","colon cancer isolates","colon epithelial cells","response of HT29 cells","control isolates","shed flagellin","mucosal barrier","invasive IBD","red blood cells","epithelial invasion","TLR5-transfected HEK293 cells","mesalamine","Crohn\u0027s disease","MAPK-dependent","Mucosally adherent","basolateral TLR5","inflammatory bowel disease","extracellular-regulated kinase","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","ERK","Mucosa-associated","proinflammatory cytokine interleukin","controls","mean","Bacterial supernatants","hydrocortisone","CONCLUSIONS","inhibition","nonhemagglutinators","BACKGROUND","function","SD","ulcerative colitis","molecular level","therapeutic concentrations","mechanisms","drugs","RESULTS","flagellate","METHODS","hours"],"language":"en"},

Fresh SS (FSS) was generated continuously from the reference cigarette 2R1. Room-aged SS (RASS) was generated by aging FSS for 1.5 h in a room with noninert surfaces with materials typically found in residences or offices. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were head-only exposed to three dose levels of each SS type and to filtered, conditioned fresh air (sham-exposure) for 6 h/day, 7 days/week, for 90 days. Room-aging resulted in decreased concentrations of various SS components, e.g., total participate matter (TPM) and nicotine, while other components, such as carbon monoxide (CO), were not affected. The CO concentrations were 6, 13, and 28 ppm for both SS types. TPM concentrations were between 0.6 and 8.7 (\u03BCg/liter and thus up to 100-fold above the maximum of average concentrations of respiratory suspended particles reported for environmental tobacco smoke. Slight reserve cell hyperplasia in the anterior part of the nose as well as hyperplastic and metaplastic epithelial changes in the larynx were the only observed dose-dependent findings. The metabolism of benzo(a)-pyrene-as a proxy for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism-was induced in the nasal respiratory epithelium and in the lungs while no effect was seen in the nasal olfactory epithelium. The lowest-observed effect level was 6 ppm CO or 0.6 \u03BCg TPM/liter. Most of the effects seen were less expressed in RASS- than in FSS-exposed rats when compared on the basis of the CO concentrations. When compared on the basis of TPM, these effects were equally pronounced for both SS types, suggesting a major role of particulate matter-associated compounds. All findings reverted to sham control levels following a 42-day postinhalation period.","publish_time":"1998-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haussmann, HANS-J\u00FC.rgen; Anskeit, Erwin; Becker, Dorothea; Kuhl, Peter; Stinn, Walter; Teredesai, Ashok; Voncken, Peter; Walk, R\u00FCdiger-Alexander","journal":"Toxicol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b904620f0e13408111de49f5060e6ea49fa83ee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzkxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SS","Room-aged SS","FSS","The CO","TPM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SS types","Fresh SS","TPM concentrations","Room-aged SS","decreased concentrations of various SS components","basis of TPM","\u03BCg TPM","FSS-exposed rats","Room-aging","aging FSS","RASS","nasal respiratory epithelium","dose levels","ppm","days","effects","liter","maximum of average concentrations of respiratory suspended particles","experimental types of cigarette sidestream smoke","nasal olfactory epithelium","dose-dependent findings","Male Sprague-Dawley rats","sham-exposure","control levels","effect level","metabolism of benzo","environmental tobacco smoke","conditioned fresh air","day postinhalation period","reference cigarette 2R1","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism","major role of particulate matter-associated compounds","proxy","materials","head","total","noninert surfaces","metaplastic epithelial changes","Slight reserve cell hyperplasia","larynx","lungs","subchronic inhalation study","pyrene","residences","nose","fold","week","nicotine","offices","carbon monoxide"],"language":"en"},

Although isolation is probably always a desirable public health measure, quarantine is more controversial. Mass quarantine can inflict significant social, psychological, and economic costs without resulting in the detection of many infected individuals. The authors use probabilistic models to determine the conditions under which quarantine is expected to be useful. Results demonstrate that the number of infections averted (per initially infected individual) through the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided that isolation is effective, but it increases abruptly and at an accelerating rate as the effectiveness of isolation diminishes. When isolation is ineffective, the use of quarantine will be most beneficial when there is significant asymptomatic transmission and if the asymptomatic period is neither very long nor very short.","publish_time":"2006-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Day, Troy; Park, Andrew; Madras, Neal; Gumel, Abba; Wu, Jianhong","journal":"Am J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4029153332f532579cd949d2ea88fe4e0c8f809f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzkzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of quarantine","Mass quarantine","effectiveness of isolation","infected individuals","quarantining of individuals","significant asymptomatic transmission","treatment of symptomatic individuals","asymptomatic period","desirable public health measure","economic costs","detection","probabilistic models","number of infections","conditions","accelerating rate","high risk","epidemic control measures","authors","Results"],"language":"en"},

The soluble receptor for advanced glycation end\u2010products (sRAGE) is a biomarker of pulmonary damage processes, with a diagnostic and a prognostic value in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The RAGE pathway is also implicated in the pathogenesis of other respiratory diseases like asthma, but the value of sRAGE levels in acute bronchiolitis remains under\u2010investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, observational, and analytical study was conducted at Clermont\u2010Ferrand University Hospital. The main objective was to evaluate the correlation between serum sRAGE and clinical severity of bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants aged \u003C1 year. We analyzed correlations between serum sRAGE and Wainwright score, short\u2010term morbidity attributable to bronchiolitis, causal viruses and risk for recurrent wheezing at 1 year. RESULTS: The study included 93 infants. sRAGE levels were significantly lower in acute bronchiolitis patients (mean 1101 pg/mL) than in controls (2203 pg/mL, P \u003C 0.001) but did not correlate with clinical severity.

Besides, during the last decades, an important effort has been done for the development of tools to use LAB as microbial cell factories for the production of proteins of interest. Given the need to develop effective strategies for the delivery of prophylactic and therapeutic molecules, LAB have appeared as an appealing option for the oral, intranasal and vaginal delivery of such molecules. So far, these genetically modified organisms have been successfully used as vehicles for delivering functional proteins to mucosal tissues in the treatment of many different pathologies including GIT related pathologies, diabetes, cancer and viral infections, among others. Interestingly, the administration of such microorganisms would suppose a significant decrease in the production cost of the treatments agents since being live organisms, such vectors would be able to autonomously amplify and produce and deliver the protein of interest. In this context, this review aims to provide an overview of the use of LAB engineered as a promising alternative as well as a safety delivery platform of recombinant proteins for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.","publish_time":"2015-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cano-Garrido, Olivia; Seras-Franzoso, Joaquin; Garcia-Fruit\u00F3s, Elena","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/427c25eb5418afb2f27b6f27b6c7c07b4ea7af08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4573465.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-015-0313-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26377321/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of proteins","use of LAB","food production","safe organisms","delivery of prophylactic","production cost","vaginal delivery","functional proteins","live organisms","modified organisms","safety delivery platform of recombinant proteins","GIT related pathologies","different pathologies","probiotic agents","US Food","treatments agents","Drug Administration","therapeutic molecules","Gram-positive bacteria","important effort","important role","Lactic acid bacteria","long history of safe exploitation","diabetes","cancer","microbial cell factories","humans","mucosal tissues","FDA","preservation","significant decrease","effective strategies","appealing option","centuries","vehicles","promising alternative","viral infections","development of tools","gastrointestinal tract","wide range of diseases","microorganisms","human health","vectors","overview","review","need","decades","intestine","species","context"],"language":"en"},

It could be wondered whether the other families of parasitoids are really absent, or if this is due to the fact that inadequate techniques were used to detect viruses. In fact, several different methods have been used: TEM of the venom glands of females, extraction of nucleic acids, followed by DNAse digestion to eliminate the polydnavirus or ascovirus genome, RT-PCR with primers specific of RdRp or data mining in an EST library. To resolve this problem of detecting RNA viruses, a systematic search for viruses in parasitoids should be carried out using a combination of these different methods. Only a few hymenopteran species are known to be infected by RNA viruses, although thousands of species are known to carry polydnaviruses or VLPs. This could suggest that the presence of polydnaviruses or VLPs may block infections with other viruses.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Renault, Sylvaine","journal":"Parasitoid Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c773fb9f0ffa3924052695757950c8d44f91cf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150315.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123848581000163; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123848581000163","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different RNA viruses","different methods","VLPs","fact","thousands of species","families of parasitoids","presence of polydnaviruses","hymenopteran species","primers specific of RdRp","data mining","RT-PCR","extraction of nucleic acids","venom glands of females","ascovirus genome","chapter","systematic search","DNAse digestion","EST library","Publisher Summary","inadequate techniques","infections","combination","problem","parasitoid wasps"],"language":"en"},

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M co-expression with either N or E is sufficient for producing virus-like particles (VLPs), although at a lower level compared to M, N and E co-expression. Whether E can release from cells or E/N interaction exists so as to contribute to enhanced VLP production is unknown. It also remains to be determined whether E palmitoylation or disulfide bond formation plays a role in SARS-CoV virus assembly. RESULTS: SARS-CoV N is released from cells through an association with E protein-containing vesicles. Further analysis suggests that domains involved in E/N interaction are largely located in both carboxyl-terminal regions. Changing all three E cysteine residues to alanines did not exert negative effects on E release, E association with N, or E enhancement of VLP production, suggesting that E palmitoylation modification or disulfide bond formation is not required for SARS-CoV virus assembly. We found that removal of the last E carboxyl-terminal residue markedly affected E release, N association, and VLP incorporation, but did not significantly compromise the contribution of E to efficient VLP production. CONCLUSIONS: The independence of the SARS-CoV E enhancement effect on VLP production from its viral packaging capacity suggests a distinct SARS-CoV E role in virus assembly.","publish_time":"2014-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Ying-Tzu; Wang, Shiu-Mei; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Wang, Chin-Tien","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4014084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766657/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-21-34","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E association","E release","E protein","contribution of E","E co-expression","E enhancement of VLP production","E palmitoylation modification","SARS-CoV N","E cysteine residues","distinct SARS-CoV E role","SARS-CoV E enhancement effect","E carboxyl-terminal residue","N association","N interaction","SARS-CoV virus assembly","efficient VLP production","enhanced VLP production","VLP incorporation","disulfide bond formation","cells","proteins","carboxyl-terminal regions","Coronavirus membrane","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","viral packaging capacity","negative effects","alanines","nucleocapsid","envelope","domains","independence","VLPs","particles","vesicles","RESULTS","lower level","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","analysis","removal"],"language":"en"},

To address this question, we analyzed the frameshifting sequence elements from animal or plant virus in yeast and Escherichia coli. Frameshifting efficiencies varied in yeast, but not in E. coli, depending on the specific conformation of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot. Similar changes in frameshifting efficiencies were observed in yeast, but not in E. coli, for the mutations in frameshifting sequence elements from cereal yellow dwarf virus serotype RPV (CYDV-RPV). The differential response of MMTV or CYDV-RPV frameshifting signal to prokaryotic and eukaryotic translational machineries implies that ribosome pausing alone is insufficient to mediate frameshifting, and additional events including specific interaction between ribosome and RNA structural element are required for efficient frameshifting. These results supports the hypothesis that frameshifting occurs by a specific interaction between ribosome and frameshifting signal.","publish_time":"2003-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Deukyong; Kang, Hunseung","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b8427d9e340967ce0493055bfa9b3253f093207.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127617.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817020300042X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817020300042X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MMTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshifting signals","Frameshifting efficiencies","efficient frameshifting","frameshifting sequence elements","CYDV-RPV frameshifting signal","specific interaction","ribosome","RNA signals","yeast","RNA pseudoknot","RNA structural element","plant virus","downstream RNA structure","Escherichia coli","hypothesis","specific conformation of mouse mammary tumor virus","cereal yellow dwarf virus serotype RPV","structural analyses","differential response of MMTV","eukaryotic translational machineries","shifty site","animal","additional events","mutations","exact nature","Similar changes","results","question"],"language":"en"},

While direct measurement of beat frequency from high-speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video (AVI) files that runs on open-source software (ImageJ) coupled to Microsoft Excel, and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high-speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia. These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz. METHODS: Digital video files of motile ciliated ependymal (frequency range 34 to 52 Hz) and respiratory epithelial cells (frequency 3 to 18 Hz) were captured using a high-speed digital video recorder. To cover the range above between 18 and 37 Hz the frequency of ependymal cilia were slowed by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin. Measurements made directly by timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles were compared with those obtained using the automated ciliaFA system. RESULTS: The overall mean difference (\u00B1 SD) between the ciliaFA and direct measurement high-speed digital imaging methods was \u22120.05 \u00B1 1.25 Hz, the correlation coefficient was shown to be 0.991 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were from \u22121.99 to 1.49 Hz for respiratory and from \u22122.55 to 3.25 Hz for ependymal cilia. CONCLUSIONS: A plugin for ImageJ was developed that extracts pixel intensities and performs fast Fourier transformation (FFT) using Microsoft Excel. The ciliaFA software allowed automated, high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency (range 3 to 52 Hz) and avoids operator error due to selection bias.

Pigs fed PC required fewer individual medical treatments than NC and pigs fed ZA were intermediate (P = 0.024). More pigs were removed from large than small groups (P = 0.049), and there was no effect of diet on removals (P \u003E 0.10). In conclusion, careful study design, protocol implementation, sample collection, and recording of important information allowed us to characterize the health status of this group of pigs and determine treatment effects on growth performance and morbidity.","publish_time":"2018-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olsen, Kristin M; Gabler, Nicholas K; Rademacher, Chris J; Schwartz, Kent J; Schweer, Wesley P; Gourley, Gene G; Patience, John F","journal":"Transl Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/468c4c6661aa11f560cd00a668fa457c473faea7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289107/; https://doi.org/10.1093/tas/txy068","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AGP","NC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group of pigs","large groups","small groups","group sizes","PC increased ADG","ZA increased ADG","dietary treatments","effect of ZA","effect of diet","PC increased ADFI","improved ADG","ZA improved ADFI","d experiment","greater G","PC required fewer individual medical treatments","DR diets","growth performance","dietary acidifier","DFM","nursery pig performance","health status","pens","d of age","treatment effects","positive control","effects of alternatives","negative control","phosphoric acid","significant interaction","careful study design","antibiotic growth promoters","multiple sire lines","randomized complete block design","future AGP alternative studies","septicemia","protocol implementation","serum","respiratory syndrome virus","sample collection","model","zinc oxide","blend of fumaric","natural challenges of acute diarrhea","resistant potato starch","PRRSV","PIC","sows","tissue samples","Diagnostic assessment of oral fluids","feed antibiotics","floor space","conclusion","piglets","BW","area","morbidity","weaning date","experimental unit","finish barn","weeks","important information","sex","ZnO","removals","Data","Bacillus","objectives"],"language":"en"},

The only source for viral genome amplification is clinical samples in which HCV is usually present at low titers. We have created a comprehensive optimization protocol that allows robust amplification of a 9.1kb fragment of HCV, followed by efficient cloning into a novel vector. Detailed analyses indicate the lack of potential LRP-mediated recombination and the preservation of viral diversity. Thus, our LRP protocol could be applied for the amplification of other difficult RNA templates and may facilitate RNA virus research such as linked viral mutations and reverse genetics.","publish_time":"2006-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Xiaofeng; Xu, Yanjuan; Di Bisceglie, Adrian M.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74886d6c8cfe90755f5e2301e9f5b81538d4c2f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092855.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X06012964; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X06012964","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amplification of RNA templates","difficult RNA templates","LRP protocol","viral genome amplification","robust amplification","RNA virus research","potential of LRP technology","long PCR of DNA templates","fragment of HCV","lack of potential LRP-mediated recombination","linked viral mutations","preservation of viral diversity","Abstract Long RT-PCR","hepatitis C virus","comprehensive optimization protocol","clinical samples","extensive secondary structures","efficient cloning","reverse genetics","source","excellent example","Detailed analyses","novel vector","difficulty","low titers"],"language":"en"},

However, there are growing reports of the toxicity of nanomaterials to humans. In particular, nanomaterials have been linked to lung diseases. The molecular mechanisms of nanoparticle toxicity are largely unexplored. METHODS: Acute lung injury was induced in wild-type mice and angiotensin-coverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) knockout mice by the intratracheal instillation of cationic polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) nanoparticles. For rescue experiments, losartan (15 mg/kg in PBS) was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before nanoparticle administration. RESULTS: Some PAMAM nanoparticles, but not anionic PAMAM nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes, triggered acute lung failure in mice. Mechanistically, cationic nanoparticles can directly bind ACE2, decrease its activity and down-regulate its expression level in lung tissue, resulting in deregulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Gene inactivation of Ace2 can exacerbate lung injury. Importantly, the administration of losartan, which is an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, can ameliorate PAMAM nanoparticle-induced lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide molecular insight into PAMAM nanoparticle-induced lung injury and suggest potential therapeutic and screening strategies to address the safety of nanomaterials.

Virus taxonomy, which officially began in 1966 under the activity of 43 virologists who created the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), has made tremendous progress in the last 40years to classify today about 6000 virus entities into more than 2000 species, themselves classified into 287 genera, 73 families, and 3 orders, as attested by the Eighth Report of the ICTV. Virus nomenclature has also progressed in parallel to virus taxonomy, and although virologists still debate about the best way to write virus species names, undoubtedly virus taxonomy and nomenclature are now in a very advanced state. However, major challenges are ahead for virologists with the exponential increase in virus genome sequencing which will be beyond 1million sequences by 2010 and the virologists have to face that challenge with organization and creativity, in order to offer to the virological community the best and most useful virus taxonomy and nomenclature.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fauquet, C.

WHO estimates 55,000 rabies deaths and more than 10 million PEP every year world-wide. A variety of cell-culture derived vaccines are available for prophylaxis against rabies. However, their high cost restricts their usage in developing countries, where such cases are most often encountered. This is driving the quest for newer vaccine formulations; DNA vaccines being most promising amongst them. Here, we explored strategies of antigen trafficking to various cellular compartments aiming at improving both humoral and cellular immunity. These strategies include use of signal sequences namely Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA), Ubiquitin (UQ) and Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein-1 (LAMP-1). TPA, LAMP-1 and their combination were aimed at enhancing the CD4\u002B T cell and antibody response. In contrast, the UQ tag was utilized for enhancing CD8\u002B response. The potency of modified DNA vaccines assessed by total antibody response, antibody isotypes, cytokine profile, neutralizing antibody titer and protection conferred against in vivo challenge; was enhanced in comparison to native unmodified vaccine, but the response elicited did not pertain to the type of target sequence and the directed arm of immunity. Interestingly, the DNA vaccines that had been designed to generate different type of immune responses yielded in effect similar response. In conclusion, our data indicate that the directing target sequence is not the exclusive deciding factor for type and extent of immune response elicited and emphasizes on the antigen dependence of immune enhancement strategies.","publish_time":"2009-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaur, Manpreet; Rai, Anant; Bhatnagar, Rakesh","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df63498139215f0a8be1adb2fb21b5bcb0caa889.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115670.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19356616/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.01.128; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X0900200X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X0900200X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tissue Plasminogen","TPA","UQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total antibody response","extent of immune response","effect similar response","antibody isotypes","antibody titer","type of target sequence","potency of modified DNA vaccines","culture derived vaccines","different type of immune responses","strategies of antigen trafficking","antigen dependence of immune enhancement strategies","cellular immunity","Abstract Rabies","TPA","LAMP","rabies deaths","directing target sequence","variety of cell","T cell","UQ tag","newer vaccine formulations","various cellular compartments","native unmodified vaccine","directed arm of immunity","cytokine profile","exclusive deciding factor","Plasminogen Activator","use of signal sequences","Ubiquitin","prophylaxis","CD4","Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein","developing countries","usage","comparison","progressive fatal encephalitis","protection","data","quest","high cost","PEP","challenge","CD8","year world-wide","cases","contrast","combination","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Despite this, patients with respiratory tract infections often receive antibiotics, fuelling the rise of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, there is a need to encourage patients to try alternative non-antibiotic therapies, which ideally treat the symptoms and the cause. Lozenges containing amylmetacresol and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA lozenges) as well as lozenges containing hexylresorcinol have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief for sore throat. In this study, we investigated whether these lozenges also have virucidal effects in vitro against two viruses associated with respiratory tract infections, parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Both viruses were incubated with AMC/DCBA lozenge, placebo lozenge or the active ingredients (AMC/DCBA) as free substances, and parainfluenza virus type 3 was incubated with hexylresorcinol lozenge, placebo lozenge or hexylresorcinol as a free substance. Virucidal effects were observed with the active lozenges and the active ingredients as free substances against both parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Mean reductions in viral titre were significantly greater compared with placebo lozenge and peak effects were observed for the shortest incubation time, 1min. These findings suggest that AMC/DCBA lozenge and hexylresorcinol lozenge have the potential to have local antiviral effects in patients with sore throat due to viral respiratory tract infections. Use of such over-the-counter treatments for self-limiting respiratory tract infections may satisfy patients\u2019 desire for an anti-infective medication and reduce the demand for antibiotics.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shephard, Adrian; Zybeshari, Stela","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37ca300e1c8d1f192fa99ecd6bb0adfc1dd5a16e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113872.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354215002235; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354215002235; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408353/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMC/DCBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hexylresorcinol lozenge","placebo lozenge","DCBA lozenges","viral respiratory tract infections","self-limiting respiratory tract infections","AMC","active lozenges","parainfluenza virus type","virucidal effects","viruses","free substances","active ingredients","peak effects","sore throat","local antiviral effects","antibiotics","cytomegalovirus","antibiotic treatment","rise of antibiotic resistance","viral titre","alternative non-antibiotic therapies","patients\u2019 desire","potential","dichlorobenzyl alcohol","over-the-counter treatments","anti-infective medication","effective symptomatic relief","Mean reductions","demand","shortest incubation time","amylmetacresol","findings","symptoms","need","cause","study"],"language":"en"},

The commensal bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus has been suggested to exert beneficial effects as a supplement during H. pylori eradication therapy. In the present study, we applied whole-genome microarray analysis to compare the immune responses induced in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with L. acidophilus, H. pylori, or both bacteria in combination. While L. acidophilus induced a Th1-polarizing response characterized by high expression of interferon beta (IFN-\u03B2) and interleukin 12 (IL-12), H. pylori strongly induced the innate cytokines IL-1\u03B2 and IL-1\u03B1. In BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus, H. pylori blocked the expression of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-\u03B2 and IL-12 and suppressed the expression of key regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases. The inhibition of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-\u03B2 was independent of H. pylori viability and the virulence factor CagPAI; however, a vacuolating cytotoxin (vacA) mutant was unable to block IFN-\u03B2. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the addition of H. pylori to L. acidophilus-stimulated BMDMs redirects intracellular processing, leading to an accumulation of L. acidophilus in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Thus, our findings indicate that H. pylori inhibits the development of a strong Th1-polarizing response in BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus by blocking the production of IFN-\u03B2 in a VacA-dependent manner. We suggest that this abrogation is caused by a redirection of the endocytotic pathway in the processing of L. acidophilus.","publish_time":"2013-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weiss, Gudrun; Forster, Sam; Irving, Aaron; Tate, Michelle; Ferrero, Richard L.; Hertzog, Paul; Fr\u00F8ki\u00E6r, Hanne; Kaparakis-Liaskos, Maria","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61316d789f66022b466f2924837aaff7f0bf65f5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/310e6155d1d7856c824b0304dea2ca5ec637c2bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3685213.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00609-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23760466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Confocal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acidophilus-induced IFN-\u03B2","acidophilus-stimulated BMDMs","pylori viability","Helicobacter pylori","pylori eradication therapy","commensal bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus","production of IFN","innate cytokines IL","processing of","strong Th1-polarizing response","expression of key regulators","immune responses","immune system","high expression of interferon beta","intracellular processing","VacA-dependent manner","Rho","murine bone marrow-derived macrophages","vacuolating cytotoxin","supplement","virulence factor CagPAI","mutant","elimination","independent of","chronic gastritis","genome microarray analysis","accumulation of","development","addition of","endocytotic pathway","redirection","Cdc42 GTPases","infected host","beneficial effects","lysosomal compartments","interleukin","inhibition of","Confocal microscopy","bacteria","combination","present study","abrogation","findings"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for head/chest cold was significantly elevated for teachers and other workers employed at schools compared to all other workers. When examined by month, an excess of increased head/chest cold risk during the school year suggested that a portion of head/chest cold among teachers and other school workers is attributable to their workplace, perhaps due to close contact with students at school. CONCLUSION: Head/chest cold, a surrogate for acute respiratory infection, was more common among school workers during the school year and less common during July than for all other workers in the United States.

Of the 1,014 patients with lower respiratory tract infections, 288 (28.4%) had a viral infection. One hundred fifty\u2010five (53.8%) presented with bronchiolitis, 100 (43.7%) with pneumonia, and 33 (11.5%) with croup. One hundred six (36.8%) and 99 (34.4%) patients had evidence of respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses infections, respectively. Adenoviruses were detected in 44 (15.2%) patients, while influenza A virus in 21 (7.3%) patients. The majority of respiratory syncytial virus infections (84%) were among patients aged \u003C1 year. Similarly, of the 99 patients infected by human rhinoviruses, 50 (50.5%) were also among this age group. In contrast, most of influenza A virus infections, 12 of 21 (57.1%), were among patients aged over 16 years. Parainfluenza virus\u20102 and human coronaviruses were not detected in any of the patients\u0027 samples. Over the 3\u2010year period, most of the hospitalized patients were seen during the autumn and winter months from October through March. These data show that respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses may be the major causes of lower respiratory tract infections in children admitted to hospital in Kuwait. J. Med.

Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that HMC\u20101 cells lack the machinery required for RSV replication. To identify the host factors required for RSV replication, cDNA subtraction using A549, HEp\u20102, and HMC\u20101 cells was performed, and cytokeratin 18 (C18) was identified as a candidate host factor. Because C18 is generally expressed in simple epithelia with cytokeratin 8 (C8), HMC\u20101 cells that constitutively express C18 and C8 (HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18) were established to evaluate the role of C8/18 in RSV replication. In HMC\u20101\u2010C8/18 cells, RSV RNA replication was increased, and the amount of infective virus produced was also increased in the cellular fraction after RSV spinoculation, whereas RSV production was decreased in A549 cells in which C18 expression was knocked down.

Limited data exist concerning infectious complications of haplo\u2010HCT utilizing mobilized peripheral blood (PB) hematopoietic cells. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients at our institution undergoing PB haplo\u2010HCT with PTCy between June 2009 and June 2015. Infections were microbiologically confirmed. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) classified as \u201Cproven\u201D or \u201Cprobable\u201D by standard definitions were included. RESULTS: In total, 104 patients were identified. Median follow\u2010up was 218 days (range: 6\u20131576). A total of 322 episodes of infection were recorded. Eighty\u2010nine percent of patients experienced at least one infection. Median time to first infection was 22 days. Patients experiencing at least one bacterial, viral, and IFI were 62%, 72%, and 6%, respectively. The majority (69%) of bacterial infections were caused by enteric organisms. Seven cases of Staphylococcus aureus infection were recorded, with one bacteremia case. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia occurred in 54/71 (76%) at\u2010risk patients at a median time of 24 days. Sixteen (15%) patients developed CMV disease. Nineteen percent (20/104) of patients developed BK polyomavirus\u2010associated cystitis. Six (6%) patients experienced a total of seven IFI. Infection was the primary cause of death for 12% (6/51) of patients and was a secondary cause for 41%. CONCLUSION: In PB haplo\u2010HCT patients, a high incidence of CMV viremia and disease was observed. Infections with enteric bacteria were common. Fungal and staphylococcal infections were uncommon. Further studies are needed to compare infectious complications in haplo\u2010HCT with other transplant modalities.","publish_time":"2016-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slade, Michael; Goldsmith, Scott; Romee, Rizwan; DiPersio, John F.; Dubberke, Erik R.; Westervelt, Peter; Uy, Geoffrey L.; Lawrence, Steven J.","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab75cb3685b8732439b252ecd470dfbdb4b5f3cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5459579.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28030755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFI","BK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCT patients","percent of patients","adult patients","at\u2010risk patients","PB haplo","bacterial infections","infectious complications of haplo","episodes of infection","IFI","staphylococcal infections","days","total","Invasive fungal infections","Median time","CMV disease","transplant modalities","PTCy","Median follow\u2010up","cases of Staphylococcus aureus infection","cell replete haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant","high incidence of CMV viremia","hematopoietic cells","introduction of post\u2010transplant cyclophosphamide","enteric bacteria","enteric organisms","secondary cause","primary cause of death","mobilized peripheral blood","use of T","retrospective cohort study","institution","regimens","BK polyomavirus","associated cystitis","Limited data","METHODS","range","CONCLUSION","standard definitions","BACKGROUND","studies","Cytomegalovirus","RESULTS","bacteremia case","majority"],"language":"en"},

The system consists of various formal and informal networks of organizations that serve different stakeholders; have varying goals, modalities, resources, and accountability; operate at different regional levels (i.e., local, national, regional, or global); and cut across the public, private-for-profit, and private-not-for-profit sectors. The evolving global health system has done much to protect and promote human health. However, the world continues to be confronted by longstanding, emerging, and reemerging infectious disease threats. These threats differ widely in terms of severity and probability. They also have varying consequences for morbidity and mortality, as well as for a complex set of social and economic outcomes. To various degrees, they are also amenable to alternative responses, ranging from clean water provision to regulation to biomedical countermeasures. Whether the global health system as currently constituted can provide effective protection against a dynamic array of infectious disease threats has been called into question by recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, dengue, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and influenza and by the looming threat of rising antimicrobial resistance. The concern is magnified by rapid population growth in areas with weak health systems, urbanization, globalization, climate change, civil conflict, and the changing nature of pathogen transmission between human and animal populations. There is also potential for human-originated outbreaks emanating from laboratory accidents or intentional biological attacks. This paper discusses these issues, along with the need for a (possibly self-standing) multi-disciplinary Global Technical Council on Infectious Disease Threats to address emerging global challenges with regard to infectious disease and associated social and economic risks. This Council would strengthen the global health system by improving collaboration and coordination across organizations (e.g., the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, national centers for disease control, pharmaceutical manufacturers, etc.); filling in knowledge gaps with respect to (for example) infectious disease surveillance, research and development needs, financing models, supply chain logistics, and the social and economic impacts of potential threats; and making high-level, evidence-based recommendations for managing global risks associated with infectious disease.","publish_time":"2019-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bloom, David E.; Cadarette, Daniel","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c03edc5c954ae36334ee52e5b60ef611d075d1ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6447676.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984169/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00549","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["unknown infectious disease threats","infectious disease surveillance","global risks","elaborate global health system","evolving global health system","dynamic array of infectious disease threats","disease control","human health","emerging global challenges","economic impacts of potential threats","weak health systems","multi-disciplinary Global Technical Council","economic risks","human-originated outbreaks","economic outcomes","world","complex set of social","different regional levels","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","national centers","different stakeholders","various degrees","varying consequences","profit sectors","recent outbreaks of Ebola","informal networks of organizations","globalization","development needs","research","financing models","Zika","areas","urbanization","dengue","bulwark","laboratory accidents","clean water provision","supply chain logistics","civil conflict","changing nature of pathogen transmission","rapid population growth","influenza","example","regard","climate change","regulation","accountability","CEPI","evidence-based recommendations","question","collaboration","alternative responses","biomedical countermeasures","pharmaceutical manufacturers","intentional biological attacks","looming threat","modalities","goals","animal populations","effective protection","respect","coordination","antimicrobial resistance","resources","concern","morbidity","mortality","Gavi","terms of severity","knowledge gaps","issues","probability","public","longstanding","paper"],"language":"en"},

The promoters of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein gene (slp), L. acidophilus lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) and enterococcal rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase gene (ermB) were fused to the coding sequence of EGFP and inserted into the backbone of the pTRKH3 shuttle vector (pTRKH3-slpGFP, pTRKH3-ldhGFP, pTRKH3-ermGFP). Besides conventional analytical methods, a new quick fluorimetric approach was set up to quantify the EGFP fluorescence in transformed clones using the Qubit(\u2122) fluorometer. ermB proved to be the most effective promoter in L. reuteri isolates, producing 3.90 \u00D7 10(\u22127) g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD(stationary culture))(\u22121).

The latter molecules have been shown to affect reproduction in both mice and humans, although the exact mechanism is still unknown. Here we report the results of a longitudinal study of the reproductive performance of a genetically modified B2m deficient mouse strain with low MHC Class I expression. Our data show that this mouse strain has an impaired reproductive performance. However, the mice superovulate well and show a normal estrous cycle. Breeding studies from crosses between the transgenic mice and the wild-type parental strain show that B2m deficient mice have a significantly lower frequency of mating than the control B2m(\u002B/\u002B) mice. In addition, the litter size and weaning success of B2m deficient mice were lower than the control. Perinatal lethality of the B2m deficient offspring was also inflicted by cannibalism of the young pups by the B2m deficient female. The impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) can be reversed by reintroducing the B2m gene in F1 heterozygous B2m(\u002B/\u2212) animals; thus the presence of B2M confers a normal breeding pattern. The acquisition of an impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) as a result of the knockout of B2m directly implicates B2M in the reproductive cycle of mice and raises the possibility of an effect of B2M on the reproduction of other mammals.","publish_time":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, Joanne C.; Dealtry, Gillian B.; Ahmed, Mohamed Abdelrahman; Arck, Petra C.; Klapp, Burghard F.; Blois, Sandra M.; Fern\u00E1ndez, Nelson","journal":"Biol Reprod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/308b29a1d34962e9f4188d69c42d5efa7626b4a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110103.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B2m gene","control B2m","presence of B2M","effect of B2M","knockout of B2m","B2m deficient offspring","B2m deficient female","weaning success of B2m deficient mice","F1 heterozygous B2m","modified B2m deficient mouse strain","transgenic mice","mice superovulate","reproductive cycle of mice","impaired breeding phenotype","impaired reproductive performance","Breeding studies","normal breeding pattern","IBP","reproduction","low MHC Class","normal estrous cycle","wild-type parental strain","biology of mammals","gene products","lower frequency of mating","association","major histocompatibility complex","litter size","young pups","pivotal role","cannibalism","longitudinal study","humans","expression","crosses","Perinatal lethality","possibility","exact mechanism","addition","microglobulin","acquisition","animals","results","data","Beta","molecules"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the humoral immune response and pathological end points in ferrets challenged with the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) after having received formalin-inactivated whole-virus vaccine or mock vaccine. Results. Humoral responses were observed in ferrets that received an inactivated virus vaccine. Histopathological findings in lungs showed that infection of ferrets produced residual lung lesions not seen in both mock and vaccinated ferrets. SARS-CoV infection demonstrated bronchial and bronchiolar hyperplasia and perivascular cuffing in ferret lung tissue, as seen previously in infected mice. No evidence of enhanced disease was observed in any of the ferrets. All of the ferrets cleared the virus by day 14, 1 week earlier if vaccinated. Conclusions. The vaccine provided mild immune protection to the ferrets after challenge; however, there was no evidence of enhanced liver or lung disease induced by the inactivated whole-virus vaccine. The ferret may provide another useful model for evaluating SARS vaccine safety and efficacy.","publish_time":"2007-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Darnell, Miriam E.

S protein could be cleaved by exogenous trypsin but not by coexpressed furin, suggesting that the protein is not normally processed during infection. Reactivity was evident by both flow cytometry and Western blot assays, but the pattern of reactivity varied according to assay and sequence of the antigen. The antibody response to SCoV S protein involves antibodies to both linear and conformational epitopes, with linear epitopes associated with the carboxyl domain and conformational epitopes associated with the amino terminal domain.

The specifics of how and where they might be implemented have recently been reviewed in the literature. However, the background and concerns for selecting between the different available methods have so far not been adequately covered. Summary: Before using predictions systems, it is necessary to not only understand how the methods are constructed but also their strength and limitations. The prediction systems in humoral epitope discovery are still in their infancy, but have reached a reasonable level of predictive strength. In cellular immunology, MHC class I binding predictions are now very strong and cover most of the known HLA specificities. These systems work well for epitope discovery, and predictions of the MHC class I pathway have been further improved by integration with state-of-the-art prediction tools for proteasomal cleavage and TAP binding. By comparison, class II MHC binding predictions have not developed to a comparable accuracy level, but new tools have emerged that deliver significantly improved predictions not only in terms of accuracy, but also in MHC specificity coverage. Simulation systems and mathematical modeling are also now beginning to reach a level where these methods will be able to answer more complex immunological questions.

The first set of samples was taken between 24 and 48 h after birth and quantified for IgG(1) concentration. A second set was taken immediately prior to vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV; at an average age of 164 d) and a third set taken 60 d post-vaccination. These later samples were quantified for antibodies specific to IBRV. Level of complement C3 was also quantified in the samples taken immediately prior to vaccination. Three hundred sixty-seven calves were from four Hereford lines; three lines were previously selected for growth traits and the fourth was a randomly selected control line. There were no consistent differences in immune traits among these lines. The second group of 165 animals were Angus, Hereford and Red Poll calves. While Angus calves had a higher mean IgG(1) concentration at 24 to 48 h of age than Hereford or Red Poll calves, no differences among breeds were found for the other immune traits measured. Calves from older dams (\u003E3 yr old) tended to have higher mean IgG(1) concentrations, pre-vaccination IBRV antibody titers and complement C3 levels than calves from 2- and 3-yr-old cows. However, these calves had lower 60-d post-vaccination IBRV titers than calves from the younger cows (P\u003C.05). As pre-vaccination IBRV antibody titer increased, post-vaccination IBRV antibody titer decreased (P\u003C.05). All pooled heritability estimates did not differ significantly from 0 (range \u2212.06 \u00B1 .08 to .21 \u00B1 .12), nor were there significant pheno-typic associations between the immune traits and growth performance.","publish_time":"1987-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muggli, N.

Once weak ties are settled, the variability of the prevalence will display a complete opposite trend to that of the arrival time, as the distance from the initial seed to the bridge node or the degree of the initial seed increases. More specifically, the further distance and the larger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of the arrival time and the worse predictability of the prevalence. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the number of weak ties on the epidemic variability. As the community strength becomes very strong, which is caused by the decrease of the number of weak ties, the epidemic variability will change dramatically.

The development of the gut immune system was determined for piglets at the ages of 14, 28, 35 and 56 days post partum. Tissue samples of the Jejunum and the continuous Peyer\u0027s patch were used for enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Both independent methods of investigation led to similar results: the population of intraepithelial CD8\u002B T cells was significantly enhanced in the probiotic group piglets (p \u2264 0.05), and the numbers of \u03B3\u03B4 T cells tended to be higher in the intestinal epithelium (p \u003C 0.1) at the time of weaning (day 28). Lamina propria lymphocytes were also influenced by the treatment. Application of B. cereus var. toyoi resulted in significantly more CD25\u002B lymphocytes and \u03B3\u03B4 T cells in the probiotic group post-weaning. The occurrence of pathogenic Escherichia coli serogroups was also less frequent in the feces of piglets from the probiotic group. The finding that the CD8\u002B T cell population in the intestinal mucosa showed changes on day 28 indicated that the influence of B. cereus var. toyoi supplementation on the intestinal immune system started before weaning, an observation supported by changes in the intestinal microflora observed during the suckling-period. The results suggest that feeding of B. cereus var. toyoi to sows may result in beneficial effects on piglet health status independent of their feed supplementation.","publish_time":"2007-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scharek, L.; Altherr, B.J.; T\u00F6lke, C.; Schmidt, M.F.G.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112577.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112577/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["probiotic group piglets","toyoi supplementation","intestinal immune system","probiotic group post-weaning","T cell population","numbers of \u03B3\u03B4 T cells","intestinal mucosa","intestinal microflora","intestinal epithelium","probiotic bacterium Bacillus cereus","feces of piglets","immune cell populations","population of intraepithelial CD8","feed supplementation","gut immune system","changes","time of weaning","sows","beneficial effects","enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations","fluorescence microscopy","feed additive","similar results","feeding trial","independent methods of investigation","Lamina propria lymphocytes","piglet health status independent","flow cytometry","Jejunum","continuous Peyer\u0027s patch","CD25","occurrence of pathogenic Escherichia coli serogroups","observation","influence of","development","finding","Tissue samples","suckling-period","days post partum","Application of","treatment","ages"],"language":"en"},

To potentially facilitate preparedness plans for future pandemics, we retrospectively quantitated surges in all-cause mechanical ventilator use during peak influenza for 12 consecutive years in all certified hospitals in Maryland. METHODS: Influenza testing data obtained for the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, Health and Human Services region 3, included defined peak influenza outbreak periods (PIOP), non-influenza time periods (non-ITP), and proportions of circulating influenza types for all study years. Procedure codes for mechanical ventilator use and diagnostic codes for medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) were reviewed for every Maryland hospitalization. Daily counts of hospitalizations associated with ventilator use or MAARI during PIOP compared to non-ITP were analyzed using Poisson regression adjusted for month and year. RESULTS: Ventilator use increased during PIOP by 7% (95% CI, 5-10) over non-ITP (P \u003C .0001) for all study years. These annual surges correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by MAARI-related hospitalizations (correlation coefficient = 0.91, P \u003C .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Surges in ventilator use were temporally associated with PIOP and were positively correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by hospitalizations associated with acute respiratory illness.

Of specific interest are the viral agents associated with RSS which have been difficult to fully characterize to date. Past research into the aetiology of RSS has implicated a wide variety of RNA and DNA viruses however, to date, no individual virus has been identified as the main agent of RSS and the current opinion is that it may be caused by a community of viruses, collectively known as the virome. This paper attempts to characterize the viral pathogens associated with 2\u20133-week-old RSS-affected and unaffected broiler chickens using next-generation sequencing and comparative metagenomics. Analysis of the viromes identified a total of 20 DNA and RNA viral families, along with 2 unidentified categories, comprised of 31 distinct viral genera and 7 unclassified genera. The most abundant viral families identified in this study were the Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Coronaviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae. This study has identified historically significant viruses associated with the disease such as chicken astrovirus, avian nephritis virus, chicken parvovirus, and chicken calicivirus along with relatively novel viruses such as chicken megrivirus and sicinivirus 1 and will help expand the knowledge related to enteric disease in broiler chickens, provide insights into the viral constituents of a healthy avian gut, and identify a variety of enteric viruses and viral communities appropriate for further study.","publish_time":"2016-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Devaney, Ryan; Trudgett, James; Trudgett, Alan; Meharg, Caroline; Smyth, Victoria","journal":"Avian Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f37e5ad5d47a81264aec6b956cfba0f38b3ae210.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113909.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7113909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral constituents","viral agents","viral pathogens","RNA viral families","DNA viruses","significant viruses","variety of enteric viruses","distinct viral genera","abundant viral families","enteric disease","viral communities appropriate","novel viruses","aetiology of RSS","week-old RSS","community of viruses","study","chicken parvovirus","chicken astrovirus","chicken calicivirus","chicken megrivirus","unaffected broiler chickens","main agent of RSS","date","avian nephritis virus","wide variety of RNA","individual virus","unclassified genera","significant economic losses","healthy avian gut","decreased body weight","elevated feed conversion ratios","poultry producers","growth","generation sequencing","Coronaviridae","Picornaviridae","Parvoviridae","Caliciviridae","total","insights","Siphoviridae","Astroviridae","unidentified categories","Runting-stunting syndrome","excessive culling","current opinion","comparative metagenomics","viromes","Past research","sicinivirus","knowledge","Myoviridae","Analysis","paper"],"language":"en"},

Since the sequencing of the human genome, we have come to appreciate that the transcriptional output of the human genome is extremely rich in non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This heterogeneous class of transcripts is widely expressed in the nervous system, and is likely to play many crucial roles in the development and functioning of this organ. Most exciting, evidence has recently been presented that ncRNAs play central, but hitherto unappreciated roles in neurodegenerative processes.

The ORF2-encoded capsid protein from PCV2 was used to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). GST-fused capsid protein from PCV2 and GST alone (both expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected cells) were used as antigens for serodiagnosis. The specificity of the ELISA for detection of PCV2 antibodies was demonstrated in sera from pigs experimentally infected with PCV1, PCV2 and other swine viruses. The semi-quantitative nature of the test was evaluated versus an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). The ELISA was performed on 322 sera from pigs in eight Brittany herds and compared with IPMA. The sensitivity (98.2%) and specificity (94.5%) of this test were considered suitable for individual serological detection. High PCV2 seroprevalence was found in sows and pigs at the end of the growth phase (18\u201319 weeks) in all eight herds. The seroprevalence in piglets (11\u201317 weeks) was statistically correlated with clinical symptoms of PMWS (93% in affected versus 54%, in non-affected farms).

Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BP03-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BP03-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot. Despite a predicted potential for N-linked glycosylation, studies with tunicamycin and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) indicated that BP03-P was not N-glycosylated in either insect cell cultures or Trichoplusia ni larvae infected with the recombinant baculovirus.

Sera from pigs experimentally infected with Brucella suis and naturally infected feral pigs, sera from pigs from a farm with a known history of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 infection, Brucella Complement Fixation Test (CFT) reactor pigs (aetiology unknown) and pigs from consistently Brucella CFT negative farms were examined. Although B. suis infected pigs recognized a total of nine B. melitensis antigens, individual pigs rarely recognized more than three antigens in the range. A 62 kDa antigen was recognized by the majority (73%) of the Brucella infected pigs, but only by 10 to 23% of pigs from the other groups. This antigen was shown to be the Brucella homologue of the ubiquitous 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-65) family by immunoblot studies with 14 monoclonal antibodies to the Mycobacterium leprae HSP-65. Only four of these monoclones (Y1.2, ML-30, D7C and IIIC8) identified the B. melitensis 62 kDa protein suggesting that unshared, potentially Brucella specific, regions exist.

A restriction analysis of the PCR products combined with analyses of all the human influenza C virus HEF gene sequences published so far permitted the design of sets of oligonucleotides which can prime PCR on cDNA of unknown influenza C virus for cloning.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; Hannoun, Claude; Nicolson, Carolyn; Robertson, James S.","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119587/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cDNA of unknown influenza C virus","human influenza C virus HEF gene sequences","laboratory strain of virus","powerful analysis of influenza C viral HEF RNA segment","PCR primers","PCR products ready","recent strain","restriction analysis","restriction sites","B viruses cDNA syntheses","combination of reverse transcription","analyses","patient suffering","polymerase chain reaction","forward","severe flu syndrome","entire coding region","oligonucleotides","cloning","binding","esterase activity studies","universal primer","Unil","design of sets","Johannesburg","work","order","kilobases","Paris","purposes"],"language":"en"},

Both splenocytes and IELs from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for LSCC-RP9, and the levels of this NK cell activity were not altered by infection of the host with rotavirus. IELs but not splenocytes from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for rotavirus-infected but not for uninfected chick kidney cell targets. Because this cytotoxic activity was not induced nor altered by rotavirus infection of the host, and was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted, it was considered to be due to NK cell activity. The cytotoxicity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells was dose-dependent; however, there was some suppression of cytotoxic activity at high effector to target cell ratios. There were no differences in the cytotoxic activities of IELs collected from the duodenum versus the jejunum. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells suggested that NK cell activity may be an important immune response to rotavirus infections in vivo. The absence of cytotoxic activity by splenocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells indicated that there may be different subpopulations of NK cells in the spleen and intestinal epithelium of chickens.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myers, T.J.; Schat, K.A.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rotavirus-infected chickens","rotavirus-infected target cells","cytotoxic activity of IELs","NK cell activity","rotavirus infections","rotavirus-infected chick kidney cells","suppression of cytotoxic activity","absence of cytotoxic activity","cytotoxic activities of IELs","cell ratios","splenocytes","cell-susceptible lymphoblastoid cell line","uninfected chick kidney cell targets","different subpopulations of NK cells","cytotoxicity of IELs","LSCC-RP9","intestinal epithelium of chickens","host","spleen","high effector","important immune response","natural killer","levels","h chromium-release assays","dose-dependent","major histocompatibility complex-restricted","Intraepithelial leukocytes","duodenum","differences","jejunum"],"language":"en"},

To profile the viruses causing ARI in children admitted to a community\u2010based hospital in central Taiwan, a cross\u2010sectional study was conducted on children under 14 years of age that were hospitalized with febrile ARI. Viral etiology was determined using conventional cell culture and a commercial respiratory virus panel fast assay (xTAG RVP), capable of detecting 19 different respiratory viruses and subtype targets. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded and analyzed. The RVP fast assay identified at least one respiratory virus in 130 of the 216 specimens examined (60.2%) and rose to 137 (63.4%) by combining the results of cell culture and RVP fast assay. In order of frequency, the etiological agents identified were, rhinovirus/enterovirus (24.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (13.8%), adenovirus (11.5%), parainfluenza virus (9.2%), influenza B (8.4%), influenza A (5.4%), human metapneumovirus (4.6%), human coronavirus (2%), and human bocavirus (2%). Co\u2010infection did not result in an increase in clinical severity. The RVP assay detected more positive specimens, but failed to detect 6 viruses identified by culture. The viral detection rate for the RVP assay was affected by how many days after admission the samples were taken (P = 0.03). In conclusion, Rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were prevalent in this study by adopting RVP assay. The viral detection rate is influenced by sampling time, especially if the tests are performed during the first three days of hospitalization. J. Med.

FIPVs are suggested to emerge from feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) by acquiring mutations in specific genes in the course of persistent infections. Although numerous studies identified mutations predicted to be responsible for the FECV-FIPV biotype switch, the presumed roles of specific genetic changes in FIP pathogenesis have not been confirmed experimentally. Reverse genetics systems established previously for serotype I and the less common serotype II FCoVs were based on cell culture-adapted FIPV strains which, however, were shown to be unsuitable for FIP pathogenesis studies in vivo. To date, systems to produce and manipulate recombinant serotype I field viruses have not been developed, mainly because these viruses cannot be grown in vitro. Here, we report the first reverse genetics system based on a serotype I FECV field isolate that is suitable to produce high-titer stocks of recombinant FECVs. We demonstrate that these recombinant viruses cause productive persistent infections in cats that are similar to what is observed in natural infections. The system provides an excellent tool for studying FCoVs that do not grow in standard cell culture systems and will greatly facilitate studies into the molecular pathogenesis of FIP. Importantly, the system could also be adapted for studies of other RNA viruses with large genomes whose production and characterization in vivo are currently hampered by the lack of in vitro propagation systems.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehmann, Rosina; Kristen-Burmann, Claudia; Bank-Wolf, Barbara; K\u00F6nig, Matthias; Herden, Christiane; Hain, Torsten; Thiel, Heinz-J\u00FCrgen; Ziebuhr, John; Tekes, Gergely","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75c2dba50049d4ee01ac711d152c62b018f31cf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6069117.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01422-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30065095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIP","FECV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP pathogenesis studies","recombinant serotype","recombinant viruses","FCoVs","molecular pathogenesis of FIP","Reverse genetics systems","common serotype","RNA viruses","numerous studies","natural infections","propagation systems","feline enteric coronaviruses","course of persistent infections","productive persistent infections","feline infectious peritonitis virus","standard cell culture systems","high-virulence biotype of feline coronaviruses","FECV-FIPV biotype switch","cell culture-adapted FIPV strains","mutations","important lethal infections of cats","FECV field","high-titer stocks of recombinant FECVs","specific genes","presumed roles of specific genetic changes","large genomes","production","characterization","excellent tool","lack of","date","FIPVs"],"language":"en"},

Exercises provide an opportunity for multiple sectors to practice, test and evaluate their response to all types of public health emergencies. The information from these exercises can be used to refine and improve preparedness plans. There is a growing body of literature about the use of exercises among local, state and federal public health agencies in the United States. There is much less information about the use of exercises among public health agencies in other countries and the use of exercises that involve multiple countries. RESULTS: We developed and conducted 12 exercises (four sub-national, five national, three sub-regional) from August 2006 through December 2008. These 12 exercises included 558 participants (average 47) and 137 observers (average 11) from 14 countries. Participants consistently rated the overall quality of the exercises as very good or excellent. They rated the exercises lowest on their ability to identifying key gaps in performance. The vast majority of participants noted that they would use the information they gained at the exercise to improve their organization\u2019s preparedness to respond to an influenza pandemic. Participants felt the exercises were particularly good at raising awareness and understanding about public health threats, assisting in evaluating plans and identifying priorities for improvement, and building relationships that strengthen preparedness and response across sectors and across countries. Participants left the exercises with specific ideas about the most important actions that they should engage in after the exercise such as improved planning coordination across sectors and countries and better training of health workers and response personnel. CONCLUSIONS: These experiences suggest that exercises can be a valuable, low-burden tool to improve emergency preparedness and response in countries around the world. They also demonstrate that countries can work together to develop and conduct successful exercises designed to improve regional preparedness to public health threats. The development of standardized evaluation methods for exercises may be an additional tool to help focus the actions to be taken as a result of the exercise and to improve future exercises. Exercises show great promise as tools to improve public health preparedness across sectors and countries.","publish_time":"2014-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dausey, David J; Moore, Melinda","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37142e322bc30493a97e2aff05533919897e39ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4120002.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063987/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["use of exercises","successful exercises","future exercises","public health preparedness","public health threats","health sector","multiple countries","federal public health agencies","types of public health emergencies","regional preparedness","preparedness plans","emergency preparedness","organization\u2019s preparedness","multiple sectors","better training of health workers","information","response personnel","vast majority of participants","average","common tools","additional tool","important actions","low-burden tool","improved planning coordination","practice","specific ideas","awareness","United States","great promise","development of standardized evaluation methods","ability","relationships","test","opportunity","overall quality","growing body of literature","key gaps","performance","priorities","improvement","BACKGROUND","influenza pandemic","observers","CONCLUSIONS","experiences","world","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The cases are two girls aged 14 and 12 seen in the Emergency Department: The first one had internuclear ophthalmoplegia and second with loss of vision and headache. They had no other neurological foci. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense plaques in both, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. One month later, the neuro-ophthalmological symptoms resolved, with normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalitis secondary to M. pneumoniae.

Taking consideration of the importance of PEDV orf3 gene, we have performed comprehensive analysis to investigate its synonymous codon usage patterns. In this study, the results of base composition analysis showed A/T rich and G/C poor in PEDV orf3 genes, and the most abundant base was nucleotide T. The relative synonymous codon usage value in each codon revealed that codon usage bias existed. The mean ENC value of each gene was 48.75, indicating a low codon usage bias, as well as a relatively instable change in PEDV orf3 genes. The general correlation analysis between base composition and codon usage bias indicated that mutational bias has an impact on the PEDV codon usage bias. Neutral analysis suggested that natural selection pressure takes a more important influence than mutational bias in shaping codon usage bias. Moreover, other factors including hydrophobicity and aromaticity have been also found to influence the codon usage variation among the PEDV orf3 genes. This study not only represents the most systematic analysis of codon usage patterns in PEDV orf3 genes, but also provides a basic shaping mechanism of the codon usage bias.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xin; Li, Pengfei; Zhang, Yating; Wang, Xianhe; Xu, Jiaxin; Wu, Xuening; Shen, Yujiang; Guo, Dexuan; Li, Yuchang; Yao, Lili; Li, Liyang; Song, Baifen; Ma, Jinzhu; Liu, Xinyang; Xu, Shuyan; Zhang, Hua; Wu, Zhijun; Cao, Hongwei","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b63f28146f06de4615b9e698cc5f7c6c7c86816.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172109.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677415/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528819302322; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.09.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528819302322","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV codon usage bias","low codon usage bias","codon usage variation","synonymous codon usage patterns","systematic analysis of codon usage patterns","PEDV orf3 genes","relative synonymous codon usage value","mutational bias","importance of PEDV orf3 gene","comprehensive analysis","Neutral analysis","results of base composition analysis","general correlation analysis","abundant base","ORF3 protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","study","virus virulence","important influence","mean ENC value","basic shaping mechanism","C poor","T rich","nucleotide","impact","pressure","instable change","ion channel","production","consideration","factors","hydrophobicity","aromaticity"],"language":"en"},

However, major health sector innovations typically emerge from negotiations between diverse stakeholders who compete to impose or at least prioritise their preferred version of that innovation. Thus, while many digital health interventions have succeeded in terms of adoption by a substantial number of providers and patients, they have generally failed to gain the level of acceptance required for their integration into national health systems that would promote sustainability and population-wide application. The area of innovation considered here relates to a growing number of success stories that have created considerable enthusiasm among donors, international agencies, and governments for the potential role of ICTs in transforming weak national health information systems in middle and low income countries. This article uses a case study approach to consider the assumptions, institutional as well as technical, underlying this enthusiasm and explores possible ways in which outcomes might be improved. METHODS: Literature review and case study analysis. RESULTS: The two systems considered have had considerable success in terms of gaining and maintaining government support and addressing the concerns of providers without compromising their core elements. In Uganda, the system has flourished in spite of severe resource constraints, using a participatory approach that has encouraged a high level of community engagement. In China, concern with past failures generated the political will to build a high quality surveillance system, using the latest technology and drawing on a highly skilled human resource base. CONCLUSIONS: Both example stress the importance of recognising the political, social and historical context within which information systems have to function. Implementers need to focus as much on the perceptions, attitudes and needs of stakeholders as on the technology. Implementers should distinguish between factors which may influence engagement at an institutional level and those aimed at supporting and supervising individuals within those institutions. Finally, we would suggest that designing interoperability into systems at the outset, rather than assuming that this can be achieved at some point in the future, may prove far easier in the longer term.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Fei; Blaschke, Sean; Lucas, Henry","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e20efa446b9d31196d08c2a0cf51d2c851bfbbad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5535287.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756767/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-017-0275-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["national health systems","weak national health information systems","institutional level","terms of adoption","case study approach","considerable enthusiasm","considerable success","digital health interventions","high level of community engagement","level of acceptance","Innovation theory","area of innovation","Implementers","major health sector innovations","case study analysis","substantial number of providers","participatory approach","high quality surveillance system","growing number of success stories","concerns of providers","supervising individuals","latest technology","diverse stakeholders","adoption of new products","population-wide application","spite of severe resource constraints","skilled human resource base","governments","sustainability","potential role of ICTs","international agencies","services","Literature review","donors","negotiations","low income countries","assumptions","historical context","integration","market-driven diffusion","importance","past failures","METHODS","government support","China","possible ways","patients","article","core elements","future","longer term","CONCLUSIONS","example","outcomes","perceptions","attitudes","institutions","preferred version","BACKGROUND","factors","interoperability","outset","point","Uganda","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that AhR is activated in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus (CoV), and contributes to the upregulation of downstream effector TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP) during infection. Knockdown of TiPARP reduced viral replication and increased interferon expression, suggesting that TiPARP functions in a proviral manner during MHV infection. We also show that MHV replication induced the expression of other genes known to be downstream of AhR in macrophages and dendritic cells and in livers of infected mice. Further, we found that chemically inhibiting or activating AhR reciprocally modulated the expression levels of cytokines induced by infection, specifically, interleukin 1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1), consistent with a role for AhR activation in the host response to MHV infection. Furthermore, while indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) drives AhR activation in other settings, MHV infection induced equal expression of downstream genes in wild-type (WT) and IDO1(\u2212/\u2212) macrophages, suggesting an alternative pathway of AhR activation. In summary, we show that coronaviruses elicit AhR activation by an IDO1-independent pathway, contributing to upregulation of downstream effectors, including the proviral factor TiPARP, and to modulation of cytokine gene expression, and we identify a previously unappreciated role for AhR signaling in CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses with human and agricultural significance. Characterizing the mechanisms by which coronavirus infection dictates pathogenesis or counters the host immune response would provide targets for the development of therapeutics. Here, we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is activated in cells infected with a prototypic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), resulting in the expression of several effector genes. AhR is important for modulation of the host immune response to MHV and plays a role in the expression of TiPARP, which we show is required for maximal viral replication. Taken together, our findings highlight a previously unidentified role for AhR in regulating coronavirus replication and the immune response to the virus.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grunewald, Matthew E.; Shaban, Mohamed G.; Mackin, Samantha R.; Fehr, Anthony R.; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9ef40fccbdc6891111b860429b4b152c970b91b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7000979.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01743-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV infection","drives AhR activation","expression of TiPARP","MHV replication","coronavirus infection","alternative pathway of AhR activation","coronavirus replication","equal expression of downstream genes","host response","proviral factor TiPARP","host immune response","TiPARP functions","increased interferon expression","unidentified role","unappreciated role","Knockdown of TiPARP","expression levels of cytokines","modulation of cytokine gene expression","mouse hepatitis virus","prototypic coronavirus","effector genes","upregulation of downstream effectors","maximal viral replication","aryl hydrocarbon receptor","transcription factor","IDO1-independent pathway","dendritic cells","cytoplasmic receptor","CoV pathogenesis","macrophages","upregulation of downstream effector TCDD-inducible poly","livers of infected mice","tumor necrosis factor alpha","proviral manner","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","sense RNA viruses","family of positive","settings","TNF-\u03B1","ADP-ribose","wild-type","immunological processes","pathogen-associated stimuli","polymerase","targets","dioxygenase","agricultural significance","WT","interleukin","mechanisms","development of therapeutics","indoleamine","findings","summary"],"language":"en"},

Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration and repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled. Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes. For example, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent \u201Chomeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio\u201D in each case and a \u201Chomeostatic window\u201D of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee a safe treatment modality to patients. Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Land, Walter Gottlieb","journal":"Mol Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2129a33c39f2b2069ae830ed95b4c446746b86d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127836.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40291-020-00460-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32248387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of DAMPs","administration of SAMPs","inhibition of SAMPs","choosing DAMPs","induction of DAMPs","homeostatic DAMP","controlled production of DAMPs","chronic inflammatory diseases","initiation of inflammatory diseases","resolution of inflammatory diseases","homeostatic window","therapeutic targets","homeostatic restoration","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","SAMP concentrations","therapeutic purposes","therapeutics","hyperresolving processes","hyperinflammatory processes","SAMP ratio","compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome","future roles","vaccination procedures","novel biomarkers","molecular patterns","role of activating damage","tissue injury","safe treatment modality","anti-cancer therapy","increasing attention","repair","case","context-dependent","opinion article","patients","distinct caveats","clinical examples","Covid","need"],"language":"en"},

CAF01 also influenced the kinetics of both the cellular and humoral response against IPV to produce a faster, as well as a stronger, response, dominated by IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c isotypes as well as IPV specific T cells secreting IFN-\u03B3/IL-2.

The 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV RNA genome was mapped structurally into ABC (a cloverleaf-like), D (a stem-loop), and E (pseudoknot) domains. The BaMV replicase complex that was isolated from the infected plants was able to recognize the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis in vitro. RESULTS: To investigate whether the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA is also compatible with BaMV replicase in vivo, we constructed chimera mutants using a BaMV backbone containing the PVX 3\u2032 UTR, which was inserted in or used to replace the various domains in the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV. None of the mutants, except for the mutant with the PVX 3\u2032 UTR inserted upstream of the BaMV 3\u2032 UTR, exhibited a detectable accumulation of viral RNA in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The in vitro BaMV RdRp replication assay demonstrated that the RNA products were generated by the short RNA transcripts, which were derived from the chimera mutants to various extents. Furthermore, the V(max)/K(M) of the BaMV 3\u2032 UTR (rABCDE) was approximately three fold higher than rABCP, rP, and rDE in minus-strand RNA synthesis. These mutants failed to accumulate viral products in protoplasts and plants, but were adequately replicated in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Among the various studied BaMV/PVX chimera mutants, the BaMV-S/PABCDE that contained non-interrupted BaMV 3\u2032 UTR was the only mutant that exhibited a wild-type level of viral product accumulation in protoplasts and plants. These results indicate that the continuity of the domains in the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV RNA was not interrupted and the domains were not replaced with the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA in vivo.","publish_time":"2013-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, I-Hsuan; Chu, Chiu-Heiu; Lin, Jen-Wen; Hsu, Yau-Heiu; Tsai, Ching-Hsiu","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59cd9fecfcd1ef7eb2bbe427809ef0fd01e894b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3720222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800142/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC","PVX RNA","PVX","BaMV-S/PABCDE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UTR of BaMV RNA","UTR of PVX RNA","BaMV RNA genome","BaMV-S","BaMV backbone","RNA products","various studied BaMV","non-interrupted BaMV","BaMV replicase complex","PVX chimera mutants","short RNA transcripts","detectable accumulation of viral RNA","minus-strand RNA synthesis","BaMV RdRp replication assay","positive-sense RNA genome","various domains","viral products","infected plants","Nicotiana benthamiana plants","protoplasts","various extents","RESULTS","wild-type level of viral product accumulation","Potato virus X","Bamboo mosaic virus","rDE","members","PABCDE","fold higher","rABCP","BACKGROUND","rABCDE","stem-loop","genus Potexvirus","pseudoknot","CONCLUSIONS","untranslated region","cloverleaf","continuity","max"],"language":"en"},

Zoonotic bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, and Bartonella species, that infect animals and humans cause various illnesses, such as fever, diarrhea, and related complications. Bacterial diseases in animals can be treated with various classes of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to drug resistance in infectious agents, e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus; this hampers the treatment of infections in livestock, and such problems are increasing worldwide. Dietary phytochemicals and herbal medicines are useful and viable alternatives to pharmaceuticals because they are economical, effective, non-resistance-forming, renewable, and environmentally friendly. They are small molecules with high structural diversity that cause selective stress to or stimulation of resident microbiota, consequently causing an abundance of such microorganisms; thus, they can be used in preventing various diseases, ranging from metabolic and inflammatory diseases to cancer. In addition, the antioxidant effects of phytochemicals prevent substantial losses in the livestock industry by increasing animal fertility and preventing diseases. Potentially effective plant extracts could be used in combination with antibiotics to decrease the required dose of antibiotics and increase their effectiveness. This strategy can help avoid the side effects of chemical antimicrobials and allow the effective use of phytochemicals for treating diseases. Furthermore, phytochemicals are considered as potential alternatives to antibiotics because of their economical, non-resistance-forming and environmentally friendly properties. Flavonoids such as resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, and phenols such as galangin, puerarin, and ursolic acid are proven to be effective as antimicrobial agents. This review provides invaluable information about the types of microbial infections in animals and the current knowledge on phytotherapeutic agents classified by their mode of actions.

Although it is essential to consider the nonprotein-coding part that represents approximately 80% of the human genome. Thus advances in sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of thousands of RNAs with low or no capacity to encode proteins but are exhibiting crucial biological functions. Long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of these ncRNAs that are longer than 200nt. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the involvement of these molecules in development and physiological processes, especially through their regulation of gene expression. LncRNAs are encoded in mammalian cells as well as in microorganisms and viruses. Several studies have found differential expressions of lncRNAs in response to viral infection of emerging viruses, which suggest important roles. In fact, they are involved in promoting viral replication, evading host immunity and regulating the host response to the infection. In addition, lncRNAs do not induce immune response compared to viral proteins; thus viruses might employ them as an effective strategy to invade their hosts. In this chapter, we discuss particularly the emerging virus\u2013host interaction associated lncRNAs through addressing their involvement in the mechanisms underlying emerging viral infections as well as in the pathways of immune system in response to these infections. We also discuss the promising role of these noncoding transcripts as biomarkers for diagnosing viral pathologies.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamsisi, Maryame; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccd397512a5a3ead8728a637bbe38d5fee3dd07d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150007.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149669000068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128149669000068","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host response","viral proteins","emerging viral infections","mechanisms of viral","viral replication","viral pathologies","viral infection of emerging viruses","immune response","host interactions","differential expressions of lncRNAs","evading host immunity","involvement","noncoding RNAs","studies","noncoding transcripts","nonprotein-coding","human genome","pathways of immune system","protein-coding sequences","biomarkers","physiological processes","discovery of thousands","molecules","development","promising role","crucial biological functions","microorganisms","capacity","mammalian cells","heterogeneous class","important roles","regulation of gene expression","effective strategy","hosts","sequencing techniques","Accumulating evidences","addition","chapter","fact"],"language":"en"},

Most emerging infectious disease agents in humans are of zoonotic origin. Bats are important reservoir hosts of many highly lethal zoonotic viruses and have been implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events in recent years. It is essential to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the genetic diversity of the bat-associated viruses to prevent future outbreaks. To facilitate further research, we constructed the database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir). Known viral sequences detected in bat samples were manually collected and curated, along with the related metadata, such as the sampling time, location, bat species and specimen type. Additional information concerning the bats, including common names, diet type, geographic distribution and phylogeny were integrated into the database to bridge the gap between virologists and zoologists. The database currently covers \u003E4100 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 viral families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide. It provides an overview and snapshot of the current research regarding bat-associated viruses, which is essential now that the field is rapidly expanding. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, DBatVir provides a convenient and powerful platform for virologists and zoologists to analyze the virome diversity of bats, as well as for epidemiologists and public health researchers to monitor and track current and future bat-related infectious diseases.

The challenge substance for immunoglobulin testing was repeated immunization with six-way distemper vaccination (DHLAPP), while the challenge substance for leukocyte subpopulations was treatment with cyclophosphamide. Immunoglobulin measurements were made by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and leukocyte immunophenotyping by fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin conjugation (flow cytometry). A battery of parameters that would be used in a typical regulatory study were taken to aid interpretation of the data generated by these methods. Body weights, food consumption, clinical observations, complete clinical chemistry and urinalysis measurements were taken. Gross pathology and micropathology of sternal bone marrow, spleen, mesenteric and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, thymus, liver and kidney were completed. The ELISA method demonstrated acceptable intra-assay reproducibility for IgM, IgG and IgE, with values in good agreement as reported for radial immunodiffusion. The immunologic challenge demonstrated a biological trend of an increase in IgM that preceded an increase in IgG with no discernible trend in IgE response, and no abnormalities in lymphocyte subpopulations. Principle flow cytometry findings related to cyclophosphamide were that the relative percent of B cells decreased dramatically and progressively after compound administration; being statistically decreased in males on day 22 compared with day \u22125. The relative percent CD4 and CD8 contribution increased, but the CD4/CD8 ratio remained relatively unchanged as total white blood cells decreased progressively. The increase in relative percent CD4 (males only) was statistically significant according to a two-sample t-test on days 17, 20 and 22 when compared with the pre-treatment day \u22125. There was a relative percent increase in CD5-panT, but absolute numbers were dramatically decreased. We conclude that an organ system approach to assessment of the immune system which incorporates humoral antibody, enumeration of lymphocyte populations and pathologic evaluation of the lymphoreticular organs assists in the interpretation of an adverse toxicological response. The ELISA method for measurement of Igs detected the expected levels of IgG, IgM and IgE due to repeated vaccinations and to cyclophosphamide treatment. The flow cytometry method was acceptable for measuring select canine lymphocyte populations and detecting the expected decrease in B cells due to cyclophosphamide treatment. Both methods may be added to a testing battery for assessing immunotoxicity in canine regulatory studies.","publish_time":"2000-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, R. D; Offutt, D. M; Longmoor, B.

Specifically, an overview of these carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from four important human viruses, including influenza, dengue, rotavirus, parainfluenza, and associated structural investigations will be presented. The surface of flavivirus is predominantly covered by E-glycoprotein (EGP) that forms dimers tethered to the surface by a stalk region. The EGP-associated glycan of the virus has been shown to be important for Dengue virus infection. Both human parainfluenza viruses and Newcastle disease virus have a surface-resident carbohydrate recognizing protein known as hemagglutinin-neuramindase (HN), which is involved in both cellular recognition and as a receptor-destroying enzyme.

A large structural heterogeneity results from differences in number, identity, linkage, and anomeric configuration of the carbohydrate residues, and also from structural differences within the hydrophobic part. GSLs form complex cell-type specific patterns, which change with the species, the cellular differentiation state, viral transformation, ontogenesis, and oncogenesis. Although GSL structures can be assigned to only a few series with a common carbohydrate core, their structural variety and the complex pattern are challenges for their elucidation and quantification by mass spectrometric techniques. We present a general overview of the application of lipidomics for GSL determination. This includes analytical procedures and instrumentation together with recent correlations of GSL molecular species with human diseases.

Despite the availability of vaccines or antiviral drugs, personal hygiene is considered as effective means as the first-hand measure against viral infections. The green tea catechins, in particular, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), are known to exert potent antiviral activity. In this study, we evaluated the green tea extract as a safe personal hygiene against viral infections. RESULTS: Using the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a model, we examined the duration of the viral inactivating activity of green tea extract (GTE) under prolonged storage at various temperature conditions. Even after the storage for 56 days at different temperatures, 0.1% GTE completely inactivated 10(6) PFU of the virus (6 log(10) reduction), and 0.01% and 0.05% GTE resulted in 2 log(10) reduction of the viral titers. When supplemented with 2% citric acid, 0.1% sodium benzoate, and 0.2% ascorbic acid as anti-oxidant, the inactivating activity of GTE was temporarily compromised during earlier times of storage. However, the antiviral activity of the GTE was steadily recovered up to similar levels with those of the same concentrations of GTE without the supplements, effectively prolonging the duration of the virucidal function over extended period. Cryo-EM and DLS analyses showed a slight increase in the overall size of virus particles by GTE treatment. The results suggest that the virucidal activity of GTE is mediated by oxidative crosslinking of catechins to the viral proteins and the change of physical properties of viral membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The durability of antiviral effects of GTE was examined as solution type and powder types over extended periods at various temperature conditions using human influenza A/H1N1 virus. GTE with supplements demonstrated potent viral inactivating activity, resulting in greater than 4 log(10) reduction of viral titers even after storage for up to two months at a wide range of temperatures. These data suggest that GTE-based antiviral agents could be formulated as a safe and environmentally friendly personal hygiene against viral infections.","publish_time":"2018-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Yun Ha; Jang, Yo Han; Kim, Young-Seok; Kim, Jinku; Seong, Baik Lin","journal":"J Biol Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f19e6df5a006cb83449f1ec0dd16a9aa6703b0dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5759362.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13036-017-0092-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29339972/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DLS","GTE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral infections","inactivating activity of GTE","virucidal activity of GTE","GTE treatment","concentrations of GTE","viral proteins","potent viral inactivating activity","reduction of viral titers","viral inactivating activity of green tea extract","durability of antiviral effects of GTE","potent antiviral activity","influenza virus","H1N1 virus","antiviral drugs","antiviral agents","log","change of physical properties of viral membranes","safe personal hygiene","green tea catechins","prolonged storage","friendly personal hygiene","various temperature conditions","duration","supplements","earlier times of storage","RESULTS","overall size of virus particles","extended periods","human influenza","ascorbic acid","citric acid","different temperatures","virucidal function","oxidative crosslinking of catechins","wide range of temperatures","powder types","tremendous public health concerns","slight increase","solution type","effective means","anti-oxidant","DLS analyses","epigallocatechin","first-hand measure","sodium benzoate","months","availability of vaccines","Puerto Rico","Cryo-EM","economic burdens","gallate","CONCLUSIONS","days","BACKGROUND","EGCG","similar levels","model","study","PFU","data"],"language":"en"},

A literature search covering pathogenesis, clinical features and therapeutics, clinically developed drugs for repurposing and novel drug targets was performed. This review presents current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical features of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The rationale for and outcomes with treatments used for SARS and MERS is discussed. The main focus of the review is on drug development and the potential that drugs approved for other indications provide for repurposing. The drugs we discuss belong to a wide range of different drug classes, such as cancer therapeutics, antipsychotics, and antimalarials. In addition to their activity against MERS and SARS coronaviruses, many of these approved drugs have broad-spectrum potential and have already been in clinical use for treating other viral infections. A wealth of knowledge is available for these drugs. However, the information in this review is not meant to guide clinical decisions, and any therapeutic described here should only be used in context of a clinical trial. Potential targets for novel antivirals and antibodies are discussed as well as lessons learned from treatment development for other RNA viruses. The article concludes with a discussion of the gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research on emerging coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dyall, Julie; Gross, Robin; Kindrachuk, Jason; Johnson, Reed F.; Olinger, Gene G.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Frieman, Matthew B.; Jahrling, Peter B.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9a3b2b8a17beb5d81c2111277d9645dc137dd32.json; document_parses/pdf_json/84c860b82c331e08dc0269ef951de3b53dee41d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5733787.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40265-017-0830-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29143192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["clinical features","MERS coronaviruses","SARS coronaviruses","approved drugs","clinical use","clinical decisions","clinical trial","review","emerging coronaviruses","drug development","Potential targets","novel drug targets","pathogenesis","current knowledge","novel antivirals","broad-spectrum potential","wealth of knowledge","repurposing","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","cancer therapeutics","treatment development","specific antivirals","wide range of different drug classes","emerging infectious diseases","areas","epidemiology","future research","antibodies","treatments","literature search","activity","RNA viruses","lessons","antipsychotics","antimalarials","discussion","gaps","outcomes","viral infections","indications","main focus","rationale","addition","context","article","information"],"language":"en"},

This case has been cited several times but without accuracy or entirety, we feel obligated to report it and share our thoughts on the epidemic among medical staff and performing endonasal endoscopic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The patient developed a fever 3 d post endonasal endoscopic surgery during which cerebrospinal leak occurred, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection later. Several medical staff outside the operating room were diagnosed with COVID-19, while the ones who participated in the surgery were not. CONCLUSION: The deceptive nature of COVID-19 results from its most frequent onset symptom, fever, a clich\u00E9 in neurosurgery, which makes it hard for surgeons to differentiate. The COVID-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection. Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak. Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Wende; Huang, Xing; Zhao, Hongyang; Jiang, Xiaobing","journal":"Neurosurgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fda3269a6534d2c659498b962070c20b3a82ecc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188148.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyaa147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302399/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical staff","epidemic","deceptive nature of COVID","Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries","d post endonasal endoscopic surgery","fever","Proper personal protective equipment","patients","department","elective surgeries","pandemic","sufficient personal airway protection","operating room","pituitary adenoma patient","social distancing","results","negative pressure","rooms","frequent onset symptom","cerebrospinal leak","IMPORTANCE","clich\u00E9","times","accuracy","entirety","BACKGROUND","neurosurgery","CONCLUSION","conditions vulnerable","thoughts","CLINICAL PRESENTATION","SARS-CoV","infection","intraoperative transmission","initial outbreak","ones","surgeons","case","quarantine"],"language":"en"},

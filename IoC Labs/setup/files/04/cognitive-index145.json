Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 \u00B1 3.5% and 10 \u00B1 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 \u00B1 1.6% and 6.2 \u00B1 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater waters of 5.4 \u00B1 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randazzo, Walter; Truchado, Pilar; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Sim\u00F3n, Pedro; Allende, Ana; S\u00E1nchez, Gloria","journal":"Water research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425251/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135420304796; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115942; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135420304796?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","PEDV","US CDC"],"locations":["Spain","Iberian Peninsula"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","occurrence of SARS","quantification of SARS","detection of SARS","reported COVID","secondary water samples","tertiary water samples","influent water","Faecal shedding of SARS","tertiary effluent water samples","lowest COVID","spread of COVID","cases","porcine coronavirus","RNA titers","coronavirus lockdown","PEDV","Spain","MgV","untreated wastewater waters","wastewater treatments plants","environmental surveillance data","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","RT-qPCR","virus nucleocapsid","early indicator","early stages","major municipalities","national authorities","exit strategy","average recoveries","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","real-time RT-PCR","aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method","Diagnostic Panel","regions","WWTPs","gene","US CDC","Region of Murcia","infection","log10 genomic copies","prevalence","members","mengovirus","area","municipality level","Iberian Peninsula","cities","relevance","community","stool","specific population","procedure","point","patients","wastewaters","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Although it has since disappeared, its threat to human health remains. Therefore, studies on the prevention and treatment of SARS are important for dealing with epidemics of this and other infectious diseases. The most promising newly developed technology for intervention in SARS may be RNA interference, an endogenous cellular process for the inhibition of gene expression mediated by sequence-specific double-stranded RNAs. Numerous studies have reported the therapeutic potential of RNA interference for the treatment of various human diseases ranging from cancers to infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. To date, most studies on inhibition of SARS-CoV replication using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been conducted in cell lines in vitro. One study using siRNAs to inhibit SARS-CoV infection in Rhesus macaques demonstrated that siRNAs were effective both prophylactically and therapeutically with no adverse effects in the animals. Challenges remaining for the application of siRNA in vivo for SARS prevention and treatment include the specificity of the siRNAs and the efficiency of delivery. However, with improvements in siRNA design and delivery methods, RNA interference has the potential to become another major weapon for combating dangerous infections due to viruses such as SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Zhijie; Babiuk, Lorne A.; Hu, Jim","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a14318461927b34bd602d055e3bec9dec84015bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099728.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099728/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HIV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["treatment of SARS","inhibition of SARS","SARS prevention","SARS-CoV infection","siRNAs","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","CoV replication","infectious diseases","therapeutic potential of RNA interference","treatment of various human diseases","Numerous studies","siRNA design","delivery methods","application of siRNA","efficiency of delivery","human health","inhibition of gene expression","small interfering RNAs","sequence-specific double-stranded RNAs","endogenous cellular process","cancers","intervention","Rhesus macaques","specificity","dangerous infections","major weapon","improvements","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","developed technology","HIV","viruses","epidemics","hepatitis","adverse effects","animals","threat","Challenges","date","study","scare","cell lines","countries","world","China"],"language":"en"},

The basic elements of a healthcare system designed according to principles derived from Antonovsky\u2019s salutogenic model of health are then presented. It is argued that Antonovsky\u2019s theory offers a productive basis for conceptualizing health and healthcare systems in that it allows us to grasp that debates between population health promotion and providing medical care, are, at their root, unproductive debates predicated on a false dichotomy. A salutogenic healthcare system is one which pays credence to the nested complexity of human health and strives to strike an adaptive balance between health production and the provision of medical care.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fries, Christopher J.","journal":"Soc Theory Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a86f1ecd3b440f7112477598f80a862c9db1ac65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aaron Antonovsky","Antonovsky"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health production","conceptualizing health","definition of health","Antonovsky\u2019s salutogenic model of health","health care restructuring","healthcare systems","salutogenic healthcare system","population health promotion practices","nested complexity of human health","Antonovsky\u2019s criticism of contemporary healthcare","salutogenic analysis of formal healthcare","benefits of Antonovsky\u2019s theory","Aaron Antonovsky\u2019s salutogenic model","provision of medical care","level of theory","complexity science","spiritual systems","adaptive balance","pathogenic approach","pathogenic paradigm","unproductive debates","starting point","multidimensional adaptive process","intersecting biological","productive basis","credence","principles","general shortcomings","false dichotomy","root","basic elements","research"],"language":"en"},

Primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma (PPSCC) is a rare malignancy; thus, a related PE is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 49-year-old female patient was admitted to Northern Jiangsu People\u2019s Hospital owing to chest tightness, cough, and breathing difficulty that persisted for 3 days. Following admission, a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography revealed an embolism in the main pulmonary artery, upper and lower pulmonary artery branch. The patient was treated with alteplase, warfarin, and antibiotics. Over the following year, she experienced recurrent chest pain and tightness and breathing difficulty, with multiple CT pulmonary angiography revealing thrombosis in the right and left main pulmonary artery. No abnormalities were observed in surrogate markers of autoimmune diseases, tumor antigen testing, or ultrasonography; thus, the cause of recurrent PE was not identified. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination revealed diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the right pleura and substantially increased glucose metabolism. A CT-guided pleural biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the pleura eventually revealed a diagnosis of PPSCC. CONCLUSIONS: PPSCC is a rare tumor that lacks specific clinical manifestations and is difficult to detect with imaging techniques. The occurrence of PE as the primary manifesting symptom in a patient with PPSCC is extremely rare. Thus, malignant tumors should be considered in patients with no risk factors for PE and/or in those with recurrent PE. An immediate diagnosis and adequate intervention can be achieved with increased awareness of this diagnosis and subsequent related examinations.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhongzhong; Feng, Tingting; Wang, Meng; Xu, Xingxiang; Wang, Yuxiu; Li, Yiran; Min, Lingfeng","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a8f6c0077259221ae45277df2e0af2e64a89acd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Northern Jiangsu People\u2019s Hospital","PPSCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related PE","pulmonary embolism","occurrence of PE","main pulmonary artery","cause of recurrent PE","rare tumor","diagnosis of PPSCC","multiple CT pulmonary angiography","lower pulmonary artery branch","PET-CT","rare malignancy","chest tightness","right pleura","positron emission tomography-computed tomography","difficulty","risk factors","recurrent chest pain","immediate diagnosis","Malignant tumors","tumor antigen testing","year-old female patient","histopathological examination","pleural biopsy","increased awareness","following year","Primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma","primary manifesting symptom","subsequent related examinations","Northern Jiangsu People\u2019s Hospital","diffuse heterogeneous thickening","surrogate markers of autoimmune diseases","thrombosis","specific clinical manifestations","patients","adequate intervention","ultrasonography","cough","BACKGROUND","alteplase","warfarin","glucose metabolism","admission","CONCLUSIONS","antibiotics","imaging techniques","CASE PRESENTATION","abnormalities","days"],"language":"en"},

Limiting the disruption of critical infrastructures during a pandemic is important for the survival and health of society (i.e., electricity, water, and food) as most medical and public health responses to a pandemic depend on these infrastructures. The studies that have looked at this issue have highlighted alarming gaps in preparedness. This study used a system dynamics model to demonstrate the likely effects of a pandemic on the USA\u2019s food system. The model reveals that a severe pandemic with greater than a 25 % reduction in labor availability can create significant and widespread food shortages. The Ebola epidemic that began in 2014 has caused severe food shortages in West Africa, which are similar to the effects that this model predicts in the USA. The likely effects of the reduction in the amount of available food are difficult to specifically predict; however, it is likely to have severe negative consequences on society. The resilience of the food system must be improved against this hazard and others.

Although many clinical experiments have been reported, the treatment of SARS is largely anecdotal, and so far no treatment consensus has been reached. We summarize 14 clinical reports and attempt to assess the effectiveness of various treatment regimens. A combination treatment of steroids and ribavirin was widely used empirically from the outset of the epidemic. In general, the use of steroids for SARS seemed beneficial, but the optimal timing, dosage, and duration of treatment have not yet been determined. On the other hand, ribavirin administration apparently reduced neither the rate of intratracheal intubation nor that of mortality. Moreover, significant toxicity, such as hemolytic anemia, has been attributed to ribavirin. A few preliminary trials and in vitro data suggest the possibility of treating SARS with interferon. Other agents, including the HIV protease inhibitor glycyrrhizin and convalescent plasma, remain to be evaluated.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujii, Takeshi; Iwamoto, Aikichi; Nakamura, Tetsuya","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4068b94284d9732d8d65dda815046eab82c655fa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/10a0d687dc662bf5b245258d5af929b519198373.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X04710892; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X04710892","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of SARS","duration of treatment","treatment consensus","combination treatment of steroids","possible return of SARS","effectiveness of various treatment regimens","ribavirin administration","use of steroids","clinical reports","clinical experiments","HIV protease inhibitor glycyrrhizin","convalescent plasma","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","optimal timing","data","possibility","dosage","hemolytic anemia","enormous attention","rate of intratracheal intubation","significant toxicity","agents","preliminary trials","control","mortality","fear","hand","interferon","outset","epidemic","disease"],"language":"en"},

Statistical regression techniques using influenza and respiratory syncytial virus surveillance data were used to estimate the number of excess hospitalisations and deaths attributable to influenza. Several International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) groupings were used for both hospitalisation and mortality estimates, including influenza and pneumonia, other respiratory disorders, and circulatory disorders. For Australians aged 50\u201364 years, the annual excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza were 33.3 (95%CI: 23.2\u201343.4) per 100,000 for influenza and pneumonia and 57.6 (95%CI: 32.5\u201382.8) per 100,000 for other respiratory disorders. For Australians aged \u226565 years, the annual excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza were 157.4 (95%CI: 108.4\u2013206.5) per 100,000 for influenza and pneumonia and 282.0 (95%CI: 183.7\u2013380.3) per 100,000 for other respiratory disorders.

Funding support plays a critical role in facilitating scholarship within the field. Our objectives were to evaluate who is receiving funding from the NIH for topics relevant to voice disorders, and further describe temporal trends in grants awarded. Methods The NIH RePORTER database was searched for grants relevant to voice disorders. Data were further organized by PI specialty, academic department, and funding totals. Furthermore, PI scholarly impact, as measured by the h-index, was calculated. Results A total of 830 funded fiscal years (for 232 unique projects) totaling $203 million have supported projects examining voice disorders. A plurality of projects (32.8%) was awarded to PIs in otolaryngology departments, followed by 17.2% to speech pathology/communication sciences departments. Although year-to-year variation was noted, otolaryngology departments received approximately 15% of funding annually. Funded otolaryngologists had similar scholarly impact values to individuals in other specialties. Conclusions The study of voice disorders involves an interdisciplinary approach, as PIs in numerous specialties receive NIH funding support. As they receive a considerable proportion of this funding and had similar h-indices compared to other specialties involved, otolaryngologists have just as much scholarly impact despite being a smaller specialty. As speech and language pathologists also comprised a significant proportion of individuals in this analysis, enhanced cooperation and encouragement of interdisciplinary scholarly initiatives may be beneficial.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwartz, Scott J.; Svider, Peter F.; Shah, Priyanka; Zuliani, Giancarlo; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Setzen, Michael; Folbe, Adam J.","journal":"American Journal of Otolaryngology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0d1b35f14111f8baba7aa90b46b16d0126993e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124223.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2014.10.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070914002531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459319/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070914002531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Purpose Interest","NIH","PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NIH funding support","funding totals","study of voice disorders","PI scholarly impact","similar scholarly impact values","otolaryngology departments","age-related laryngeal disorders","encouragement of interdisciplinary scholarly initiatives","numerous specialties","grants relevant","Funded otolaryngologists","PIs","PI specialty","unique projects","plurality of projects","NIH RePORTER database","significant proportion of individuals","similar h-indices","communication sciences departments","interdisciplinary approach","topics relevant","smaller specialty","speech pathology","considerable proportion","year variation","h-index","funded fiscal years","enhanced cooperation","analysis","critical role","academic department","variety of neoplastic","facilitating scholarship","development of laryngology","language pathologists","temporal trends","established subspecialty","field","Methods","Conclusions","Abstract Purpose","objectives"],"language":"en"},

This review also provides a range of hand sanitisation product formulations, and manufacturing instructions to allow for extemporaneous preparations at the community and hospital pharmacies during this urgent crisis. In addition, this emergent situation is expected to continue, hence hand sanitisers will be in demand for an extended time, and the availability and purchase of substandard products on the market create an ongoing safety concern.

Despite a common coping strategy for mass casualty (earthquake and blast injury) in China, SARI epidemic has proposed a new challenge for healthcare workers, especially intensivists. About 15\u201320% of suspected and confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics developed severe hypoxemia (since the second week of disease course), and required some form of ventilatory support such as high-flow nasal cannula, and non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, other complications might occur, including, but not limited to, shock, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis. No antiviral agents have been proven to be effective against the coronavirus. Therefore, management of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection still remains supportive rather than definitive, indicating remarkable workload for intensive care physicians and nurses. This surge of critically ill patients in designated hospitals as well as fever clinics represents urgent demands for intensive care with regards to space, supplies, and staff (Table 1) [5,6,7,8].

Three accessory proteins encoded by diverse retroviruses, HIV-1 Nef, EIAV S2, and MLV Glycogag, each independently disrupt SERINC5 antiviral activity, by redirecting SERINC5 from the site of virion assembly on the plasma membrane to an internal RAB7\u002B endosomal compartment. Pseudotyping retroviruses with particular glycoproteins, e.g., the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV G), renders the infectivity of particles resistant to inhibition by virion-associated SERINC5. To better understand viral determinants for SERINC5-sensitivity, the effect of SERINC5 was assessed using HIV-1, MLV, and M-PMV virion cores, pseudotyped with glycoproteins from Arenavirus, Coronavirus, Filovirus, Rhabdovirus, Paramyxovirus, and Orthomyxovirus genera. Infectivity of particles, pseudotyped with HIV-1, amphotropic-MLV, or influenza virus glycoproteins, was decreased by SERINC5, whether the core was provided by HIV-1, MLV, or M-PMV. Particles generated by all three cores, and pseudotyped with glycoproteins from either avian leukosis virus-A, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), ecotropic-MLV, HTLV-1, Measles morbillivirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), Marburg virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), or VSV, were insensitive to SERINC5. In contrast, particles pseudotyped with M-PMV, RD114, or rabies virus (RABV) glycoproteins were sensitive to SERINC5, but only with particular retroviral cores. Resistance to SERINC5 by particular glycoproteins did not correlate with reduced SERINC5 incorporation into particles or with the route of viral entry. These findings indicate that some non-retroviruses may be sensitive to SERINC5 and that, in addition to the viral glycoprotein, the retroviral core influences sensitivity to SERINC5. IMPORTANCE The importance of SERINC5 for inhibition of retroviruses is underscored by convergent evolution among three non-monophyletic retroviruses, each of which encodes a structurally unrelated SERINC5 inhibitor. One of these retroviruses causes tumors in mice, a second anemia in horses, and a third causes AIDS. SERINC5 is incorporated into retrovirus particles where it blocks entry into target cells, via a mechanism that is dependent on the viral glycoprotein. Here we demonstrate that retroviruses pseudotyped with glycoproteins from several non-retroviruses are also inhibited by SERINC5, suggesting that enveloped viruses other than retroviruses may also be inhibited by SERINC5. Additionally, we found that sensitivity to SERINC5 is determined by the retrovirus core, as well as by the glycoprotein. By better understanding how SERINC5 inhibits viruses we hope to extend fundamental understanding of virus replication and of the native role of SERINC5 in cells, and perhaps to advance the development of new antiviral strategies.","publish_time":"2019-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diehl, William E.; Guney, Mehmet H.; Kyawe, Pyae Phyo; White, Judith M.; Pizzato, Massimo; Luban, Jeremy","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5efae48a9bbfccac8d9e6c1a80c8c605d80ee21.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0ad09b2806103e7ad03cad1653563554cfca2c08.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/780577","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV G"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SERINC5-sensitivity","importance of SERINC5","effect of SERINC5","virion-associated SERINC5","SERINC5 antiviral activity","native role of SERINC5","reduced SERINC5 incorporation","unrelated SERINC5 inhibitor","non-retroviruses","inhibition of retroviruses","Host plasma membrane protein SERINC5","particular glycoproteins","diverse retroviruses","Pseudotyping retroviruses","influenza virus glycoproteins","non-monophyletic retroviruses","HIV","budding retrovirus particles","viral glycoprotein","Ebola virus","Marburg virus","rabies virus","retrovirus core","infectivity of particles resistant","MLV Glycogag","amphotropic-MLV","ecotropic-MLV","PMV virion cores","avian leukosis virus","route of viral entry","particular retroviral cores","fundamental understanding of virus replication","viral determinants","retroviral core influences sensitivity","subsequent entry","human endogenous retrovirus","vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein","susceptible target cells","site of virion assembly","VSV G","enveloped viruses","causes AIDS","development of new antiviral strategies","severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","LCMV","lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus","Rhabdovirus","Measles morbillivirus","Nef","RABV","convergent evolution","Paramyxovirus","internal RAB7","SARS-CoV","Filovirus","EIAV S2","horses","HERV","HTLV","mice","RD114","mechanism","endosomal compartment","accessory proteins","anemia","Orthomyxovirus genera","tumors","addition","Resistance","findings","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization reports that the mortality rate of severe-type COVID-19 is over 50%. Currently, the number of severe cases worldwide has increased rapidly, but the experience in the treatment of infected patients is still limited. Given the lack of specific antiviral drugs, multi-organ function support treatment is important for patients with COVID-19. To improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality of patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19, this paper summarizes the experience of organ function support in patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19 in Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. This paper systematically summarizes the procedures of functional support therapies for multiple organs and systems, including respiratory, circulatory, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems, among patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19.

Viroporins form transmembrane pores in host cells via oligomerization, thereby destroying cellular homeostasis and inducing cytopathy for virus replication and virion release. Among the Picornaviridae family of viruses, the 2B protein encoded by enteroviruses is well understood, whereas the viroporin activity of the 2B protein encoded by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has not yet been described. An analysis of the FMDV 2B protein domains by computer-aided programs conducted in this study revealed that this protein may contain two transmembrane regions. Further biochemical, biophysical and functional studies revealed that the protein possesses a number of features typical of a viroporin when it is overexpressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as well as in FMDV-infected cells. The protein was found to be mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with both the N- and C-terminal domains stretched into the cytosol. It exhibited cytotoxicity in Escherichia coli, which attenuated 2B protein expression. The release of virions from cells infected with FMDV was inhibited by amantadine, a viroporin inhibitor. The 2B protein monomers interacted with each other to form both intracellular and extracellular oligomers. The Ca(2\u002B) concentration in the cells increased, and the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane was disrupted in cells that expressed the 2B protein. Moreover, the 2B protein induced intense autophagy in host cells.

METHODS: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-COV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. FINDINGS: Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %, and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1\u20132 weeks, and \u003E2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imai, Kazuo; Tabata, Sakiko; Ikeda, Mayu; Noguchi, Sakiko; Kitagawa, Yutaro; Matuoka, Masaru; Miyoshi, Kazuyasu; Tarumoto, Norihito; Sakai, Jun; Ito, Toshimitsu; Maesaki, Shigefumi; Tamura, Kaku; Maeda, Takuya","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/165c4581ff3772a22d772f0cc5c38dda8a21bcc2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b1d8778aca78197eea72c7043fb328b6aab5640c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191278.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387968/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301359?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104393; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301359","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgM/IgG","IgM/IgG Antibody","IgM","CT","IC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-COVID","the139 COVID","diagnosing COVID","IC assay","serum specimens","IgG antibody assay","presence of IgM","asymptomatic patients","combination of chest CT","diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan","SARS-CoV2","false-positive result","weeks","chest computed tomography","diagnosis of Coronavirus disease","Step Novel Coronavirus","low sensitivity","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","initial diagnostic testing","early phase of infection","immunochromatographic","clinical performance","symptom onset","CONCLUSION","RT-qPCR","BACKGROUND","FINDINGS","METHODS","admission"],"language":"en"},

Viral infection can be identified in 24 % to 31.9 % of children, and in 13.3 % of adults. The three most frequent viruses are rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV), detected in 8.8 %, 6.4 % and 6 % of cases, respectively. Due to its amplifying properties, the use of PCR increases the frequency of viral detection, and appears particularly appropriate in asthma where the viral load can be reduced. In a study of bronchiolitis, RSV, PIV3, AdV and RV were identified in 39.3 %, 4.3 %, 1.4 % and 3.9 % of cases, respectively, by IF or culture, and in 62.4 %, 8.3 %, 10.8 % and 12.6 % of cases, respectively, by PCR. Two recent epidemiological surveys used molecular diagnosis in asthma attacks. In a series of 61 adults, 27 (44 %) infections were identified: 16 RV, 4 CV OC43, 3 PIV, 1 RSV, 1 VI, 1 Chlamydia psitacci. In children, viral infection was detected in 226 cases (77 %) : 84 RV, 38 CV, 21 IV, 21 PIV, 12 RSV. We have performed a short retrospective survey for 1997, using molecular biology, on 39 nasal aspirates from children consulting for asthma or wheezing bronchitis. Testing for respiratory viruses by conventional techniques identified 8 (20.5 %) viral infections: 3 RV, 3 RSV, 1 IBV and 1 VPI2. After nucleic acid extraction, PCR-hybridization techniques were applied to these samples to detect RSV, AdV, RV, CV 229E, CV OC43, CP and MP sequences. Twenty six aspirates (54 %) were positive only on molecular biology techniques: 11 RSV, 12 RV, 2 enterovirus, 1 CV OC43. Overall 34 (82 %) viral infections were detected in these children, and a mixed RSV-RV infection was identified in 6 cases. Compared to the studies reported in the literature, we observed the same predominance of RV infections, more RSV infections, probably related to the use of PCR, and a lower incidence of CV infections.","publish_time":"1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freymuth, F.; Vabret, A.; Brouard, J.; Duhamel, J.

In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 5.60). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic. Awareness of the national pandemic preparedness plan is likely to promote prefecture-wide implementation of BCPs and surveillance activity.","publish_time":"2013-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomizuka, Taro; Kanatani, Yasuhiro; Kawahara, Kazuo","journal":"BMC Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b227d1996bc5dfd895b43f6c6e2449c58252c67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3840630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24252688/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2296-14-174","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["national pandemic preparedness plan","influenza pandemic","importance of pandemic preparedness","individual preparedness","national preparedness plan","preparedness of clinics","PCP preparedness","individual PCPs","eligible PCPs","Clinic-based PCPs","hospital-based PCPs","preparedness of different institutional settings","threat of pandemic outbreaks","H7N9 influenza","H5N1 influenza","Japan","primary care practices","adequate business continuity plan","differences","response","N95 masks","Okinawa","survey questionnaire","eye protection","gowns","addition","Cases of emerging infectious diseases","PPE availability","frontline","prefecture-wide implementation of BCPs","high-level personal protective equipment","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","swab specimen","local medical laboratory","surveillance activity","BACKGROUND","communities","regard","hospitals","role","Awareness","logistic regression analyses","CONCLUSIONS","recent years","establishment","Data","METHODS","RESULTS","total","low rate","knowledge","studies"],"language":"en"},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 193 patients with severe covid-19 were collected. 48 patients with severe covid-19 had diabetes, and 145 patients (ie, the controls) did not have diabetes. A severe case was defined as including at least one of the following criteria: (1) Respiratory rate \u003E30/min. (2) Oxygen saturation \u226493%. (3) PaO(2)/FiO(2)\u2264300 mm Hg. (4) Patients, either with shock or respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, or combined with other organ failure, requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Of 193 patients with severe covid-19, 48 (24.9%) had diabetes. Compared with patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes, patients with diabetes were older, susceptible to receiving mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU, and had higher mortality. In addition, patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes had higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, high-sensitivity C reaction protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, interleukin (IL) 2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor \u03B1, D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactic dehydrogenase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Among patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes, more non-survivors were men (30 (76.9%) vs 9 (23.1%)). Non-survivors had severe inflammatory response, and cardiac, hepatic, renal and coagulation impairment. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a trend towards poorer survival in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes than patients without diabetes. The HR was 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.30; p=0.041) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease by Cox regression. The median survival durations from hospital admission in patients with severe covid-19 with and without diabetes were 10 days and 18 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes is considerable.

Oxidative stress is attributed to such pathological condition that further contributes to the initiation and progression of liver injury. In the present study, we have investigated if the strong antioxidant power of Nicotinamide (NA), Vitamin B2 (VB2), and Vitamin C (VC) can ameliorate TAA-induced oxidative stress-mediated liver injury in the rats. METHODS: Thirty-six albino rats were divided into six groups: Control group; TAA group (IP injection with TAA at a dosage of 200 mg/Kg three times a week for two months); TAA \u002B NA group (rats administered with NA at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily besides TAA as in the control); TAA \u002B VB2 group (rats administered with vitamin B2 at a dosage of 30 mg/kg daily besides injection with TAA); TAA \u002B VC group (rats administered with vitamin C at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily along with injection of TAA). TAA \u002B NA \u002B VB \u002B VC group (rats administered the with the three vitamins daily in TAA pre-injected at the respective doses described above). RESULTS: Treatment of rats with TAA led to a significant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1) in the serum samples. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline and nitic oxide (NO) were also significantly increased in the TAA-treated rats, while reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly compromised in the hepatic samples. Rats administered with NA, VB2, and VC as individually or in combination ameliorated the deleterious effects of TAA that was confirmed by histopathology. However, the combination of the three vitamins was found more effective as compared to each of the vitamins. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates that NA, VB2, and VC cross-talk with each other that act as a more potent biochemical chain of antioxidant defense against TAA-induced toxicities in vivo.","publish_time":"2018-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bashandy, Samir A.

There are now thought to be four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses; these include rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, including Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, and astrovirus. The association of these agents with gastroenteritis has been made by their electron microscopic detection in stool and intestinal biopsy specimens from affected patients, the inability to detect the viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses after infection; in some instances disease transmission was achieved in human volunteers. The association of these viral agents with gastroenteritis has facilitated the study of classification, epidemiology, immunity, diagnostic tests, methods of treatment and, most importantly, disease prevention strategies such as vaccine development for rotavirus. This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to the pertinent molecular biology as well as current and future prospects for vaccination. Enteric viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with AIDS are also discussed.","publish_time":"1993-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwab, Kenneth S.; Shaw, Robert D.","journal":"Bailli\u00E8re\u0027s Clinical Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e443d761a2cb76075655aa22826a5e6ae0a6afd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/095035289390044S; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095035289390044S","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral agents","viruses","pathogenesis of viral gastroenteritis","major subclassifications of gastroenteritis","Norwalk","Enteric viral infections","rotavirus","association","instances disease transmission","disease prevention strategies","affected patients","vaccine development","enteric adenovirus","major features","subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses","intestinal biopsy specimens","stool","immunity","gastrointestinal tract","diagnostic tests","electron microscopic detection","epidemiology","inability","study of classification","calicivirus","pertinent molecular biology","methods of treatment","special attention","recovery","aetiology","future prospects","human volunteers","vaccination","AIDS","decades","Abstract Increased knowledge","chapter","astrovirus"],"language":"en"},

Hospitals face increasing risk of periods of scarcity of life-sustaining resources such as ventilators for mechanical respiratory support, as has been the case in Italy as of March, 2020. The National Academy of Medicine has provided guidance on crisis standards of care, which call for the reallocation of scarce medical resources to those who will benefit most during extreme situations. Given that this will require a departure from the usual fiduciary duty of the bedside clinician, we determined and mapped potential barriers to the implementation of the guidelines from stakeholders using an implementation science framework. Methods: A protocol was created to operationalize national and state guidelines for triaging ventilators during crisis conditions. Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted from July-September 2018 with clinicians at three acute care hospitals of an urban academic medical center. Respiratory therapists, intensivists, nursing leadership and the palliative care interdisciplinary team participated in focus groups. Key informant interviews were conducted with emergency management, respiratory therapy and emergency medicine. Subjects were presented the protocol and their reflections were elicited using a semi-structured interview guide. Data from transcripts and notes were categorized using a coding strategy based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. Results: Participants anticipated that implementing this protocol would challenge their roles and identities as clinicians including both their fiduciary duty to the patient and their decision-making autonomy. Despite this, many participants acknowledged the need for such a protocol to standardize care and minimize bias as well as to mitigate potential consequences for individual clinicians. Participants identified the question of considering patient quality of life in triage decisions as an important and unresolved ethical issue in disaster triage. Conclusion: Clinicians\u0027 discomfort with shifting roles and obligations could pose implementation barriers for crisis standards of care.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuang, Elizabeth; Cuartas, Pablo A; Powell, Tia; Gong, Michelle Ng","journal":"AJOB empirical bioethics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369433/; https://doi.org/10.1080/23294515.2020.1759731","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The National Academy of Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protocol","crisis standards of care","acute care hospitals","Participants","implementation barriers","palliative care interdisciplinary team","health care systems\u0027 vulnerabilities","emergency medicine","respiratory therapy","crisis conditions","implementation science framework","Respiratory therapists","key informant interviews","individual clinicians","focus groups","patient quality of life","usual fiduciary duty","mapped potential barriers","mechanical respiratory support","National Academy of Medicine","emergency management","scarcity of life","triaging ventilators","triage decisions","shifting roles","state guidelines","disaster triage","sustaining resources","reallocation of scarce medical resources","potential consequences","Theoretical Domains Framework","urban academic medical center","nursing leadership","obligations","unresolved ethical issue","pandemic","guidance","bedside clinician","Clinicians\u0027 discomfort","intensivists","increasing risk of periods","stakeholders","coding strategy","notes","Conclusion","question","identities","semi-structured interview guide","COVID","reflections","departure","bias","decision-making autonomy","case","Data","transcripts","Background","need","extreme situations","Italy","Results","Methods","Subjects"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the mechanisms of such inflammatory diseases, potential chemokine gene activation in human astroglial cells was investigated following treatment with N. fowleri lysates. We demonstrated that N. fowleri are potent inducers for the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) genes in human astroglial cells which was preceded by activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In addition, N. fowleri lysates induces the DNA binding activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1), an important transcription factor for IL-8 induction. The specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK inhibitor, U0126, blocks N. fowleri-mediated AP-1 activation and subsequent IL-8 induction. N. fowleri-induced IL-8 expression requires activation of ERK in human astroglial cells. These findings indicate that treatment of N. fowleri on human astroglial cells leads to the activation of AP-1 and subsequent expression of IL-8 which are dependent on ERK activation.

Previous investigations have shown that the MHV spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity in mice and rats. To understand the molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis, we studied the spike protein gene sequences of several neutralization-resistant variants of the JHM strain of MHV, which were selected with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein. We found that variant 2.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.2.2 and primarily caused demyelination, had a single point mutation at nucleotide (NT) 3340, as compared to the parental JHM virus, which predominantly caused encephalitis. This site was in the S2 subunit of the S protein. In contrast, variant 7.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.7.2 and primarily caused encephalitis, had two point mutations at NT 1766 and 1950, which were in the S1 subunit. Finally, the double mutant 2.2/7.2-V-2, which was selected with both MAbs J.2.2 and J.7.2, and was attenuated with respect to both virulence and the ability to cause demyelination, had a deletion spanning from NT 1523 to 1624 in the S1 and a point mutation at NT 3340 in the S2. We conclude that at least two regions of the S protein contribute to neuropathogenicity of MHV. We have also isolated a partial revertant of 2.2-V-1, which was partially resistant to MAb 1.2.2 but retained the same neuropathogenicity as the variant 2.2-V-1. This revenant retained the mutation at NT 3340, but had a second-site mutation at NT 1994, further confirming that NT 3340 contributed to the pathogenic phenotype of MHV. By comparing these results with MHV variants isolated in other laboratories, which had mutations in other sites on the S gene and yet retained the demyelinating ability, we suggest that the ability of JHM viruses to induce demyelination is determined by the interaction of multiple sites on the S gene, rather than the characteristics of a single, unique site. Our study also revealed the possible presence of microheterogeneity of S gene sequence, particularly in the S1 region, in these viruses. The sequence microheterogeneity may also contribute to the differences in their biological properties.","publish_time":"1992-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, F.-I.; Fleming, John O.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e3516329587d358addc1db03585110e303971dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290041M; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290041M","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S protein","MHV spike","MHV variants","neuropathogenicity of MHV","S gene sequence","demyelination","JHM strain of MHV","site mutation","spike protein gene sequences","pathogenic phenotype of MHV","single point mutation","encephalitis","ability of JHM viruses","molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis","point mutations","S1 subunit","parental JHM virus","sequence microheterogeneity","demyelinating ability","S1 region","S2 subunit","unique site","MAbs","neutralization-resistant variants","possible presence of microheterogeneity","interaction of multiple sites","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","critical determinant of viral tropism","characteristics","mice","coronavirus","nucleotide","monoclonal antibodies","rats","differences","virulence","susceptible rodents","laboratories","Previous investigations","biological properties","study","respect","double mutant","partial revertant","results","contrast","deletion","revenant","regions"],"language":"en"},

The paper aims to investigate the airflow patterns and pollutant transmission within a building under the effects of wind and thermal forces. A hypothetical twenty-storey slab-shape high-rise building in Shanghai with single-sided natural ventilation is set as the research object in the present study. The intensity of solar radiation on a typical day during transition season is theoretically analysed. The temperature difference between the heated building envelope and the ambient air is calculated by a simplified heat balance model. Finally, the tracer gas method is employed in the numerical simulation to analyse the influence of the wind and wall thermal plume flow on the inter-flat pollutant transmission characteristics. The results show that, the temperature difference between sunward and shady side wall is about 10 K at noon on the designate day.

There are a very large number of mechanisms in the visual pathway which could potentially be the targets of autoimmune attack. In practice it is the retina and the anterior visual pathway (optic nerve and chiasm) that are recognised as being affected in autoimmune disorders. Multiple Sclerosis is one of the commonest causes of visual loss in young adults because of the frequency of attacks of optic neuritis in that condition, however the basis of the inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis and the confirmation of autoimmunity is lacking. The immune process is known to be highly unusual in that it is not systemic and confined to the CNS compartment. Previously an enigmatic partner to Multiple Sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica is now established to be autoimmune and two antibodies \u2013 to Aquaporin4 and to Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein \u2013 have been implicated in the pathogenesis. The term Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy is applied to those cases of optic neuritis which require long term immunosuppression and hence are presumed to be autoimmune but where no autoimmune pathogenesis has been confirmed. Optic neuritis occurring post-infection and post vaccination and conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and various vasculitides may cause direct autoimmune attack to visual structures or indirect damage through occlusive vasculopathy. Chronic granulomatous disorders such as Sarcoidosis affect vision commonly by a variety of mechanisms, whether and how these are placed in the autoimmune panoply is unknown. As far as the retina is concerned Cancer Associated Retinopathy and Melanoma Associated Retinopathy are well characterised clinically but a candidate autoantibody (recoverin) is only described in the former disorder. Other, usually monophasic, focal retinal inflammatory disorders (Idiopathic Big Blind Spot Syndrome, Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy and Acute Macular Neuroretinitis) are of obscure pathogenesis but an autoimmune disorder of the post-infectious type is plausible. Visual loss in autoimmunity is an expanding field: the most significant advances in research have resulted from taking a well characterised phenotype and making educated guesses at the possible molecular targets of autoimmune attack.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petzold, Axel; Wong, Sui; Plant, Gordon T.","journal":"Handbook of Clinical Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a3e2dd567c616b2c9caf284b936638cbf925fde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152494.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-63432-0.00020-7; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444634320000207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27112687/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444634320000207","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein","Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy","Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autoimmune pathogenesis","autoimmune panoply","number of autoimmune disorders","direct autoimmune attack","visual structures","visual function","possible molecular targets of autoimmune attack","optic nerve","cases of optic neuritis","anterior visual pathway","Multiple Sclerosis","commonest causes of visual loss","Chronic granulomatous disorders","term Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy","focal retinal inflammatory disorders","obscure pathogenesis","Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy","large number of mechanisms","post-infection","confirmation of autoimmunity","characterised phenotype","variety of mechanisms","Acute Macular Neuroretinitis","Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","post-infectious type","long term immunosuppression","Idiopathic Big Blind Spot Syndrome","conditions","post vaccination","various vasculitides","young adults","indirect damage","educated guesses","frequency of attacks","expanding field","Aquaporin4","vision","Sarcoidosis","Neuromyelitis Optica","occlusive vasculopathy","enigmatic partner","significant advances","basis","inflammation","Melanoma","Cancer","chiasm","Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein","candidate autoantibody","antibodies","recoverin","research","CNS compartment","Abstract","immune process","practice"],"language":"en"},

Thirty cats with sporotrichosis were recruited to the study, including three FIV-positive and five FeLV-positive (progressive infection) cats. One cat with regressive FeLV infection was excluded from statistics. In comparison to retrovirus-negative cats, FIV-positive cats and FeLV-positive cats had higher IL-10 levels, FeLV-positive cats had lower IL-4 levels and FIV-positive cats had lower IL-12 levels and a lower CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B ratio. Remarkably, all cats with poor general condition were FeLV (progressive infection) or FIV-positive, but the retrovirus status was not associated with the sporotrichosis treatment length or outcome. The immunological changes and the more severe clinical presentation observed in cats with retrovirus co-infections encourage future prospective studies that address the impact of these changes on prognostic determinants of feline sporotrichosis and the development of new therapy strategies that control disease spread.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Miranda, Luisa Helena Monteiro; Meli, Marina; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Silva, F\u00E1tima; Novacco, Marilisa; Menezes, Rodrigo Caldas; Pereira, Sandro Antonio; Sugiarto, Sarah; dos Reis, \u00C9rica Guerino; Gremi\u00E3o, Isabella Dib Ferreira; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7387ab0ad7fdb62b372043fc912931583e5c7af0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6267967.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500849/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207644","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FeLV-positive cats","FIV-positive cats","FIV infection","retrovirus-negative cats","FeLV co-infection","lower IL","Sporothrix-infected cats","regressive FeLV infection","higher IL","progressive infection","levels","prognostic determinants of feline sporotrichosis","Feline Immunodeficiency Virus","sporotrichosis treatment length","critical cases of sporotrichosis","lower CD4","retrovirus status","potential impact of retrovirus co-infections","Feline Leukemia Virus","CD8","immunological changes","study","cause immunodeficiency","antigen ELISA","Sporothrix brasiliensis","Cytokine transcription","cytokine profile","immunological parameters","severe clinical presentation","future prospective studies","development of new therapy strategies","lymphocyte subpopulations","poor general condition","CD21","association","IFN-\u03B3","disease spread","RT-qPCR","CD5","immunity","provirus PCR","outcome","ratio","comparison","statistics","Western blot","TNF-\u03B1","flow cytometry","zoonotic transmission"],"language":"en"},

Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19.

The key challenge for achieving effective gene silencing in particular for the purpose of the therapeutics is primarily dependent on the effectiveness and specificity of the RNAi targeting sequence. However, only a limited number of siRNAs is capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specific gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. In addition, the efficacy of siRNA-induced gene silencing can only be experimentally measured based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is important to establish a fully robust and comparative validating system for determining the efficacy of designed siRNAs. In this study, we have developed a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi targeting sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression. The efficacy of the siRNAs is measured by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporter gene with easily quantified readouts including enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase. Using fully analyzed siRNAs against human hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) and tumor suppressor protein p53, we have demonstrated that this system could effectively and faithfully report the efficacy of the corresponding siRNAs. In addition, we have further applied this system for screening and identification of the highly effective siRNAs that could specifically inhibit expression of mouse matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), and human serine/threonine kinase AKT1. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this novel reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective siRNAs but also implicates in the use of RNAi for studying novel gene function in mammals.","publish_time":"2006-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Chuan-Fu; Lu, Kuang-Chu; Cheng, Tsung-Lin; Wu, Ren-Huang; Huang, Lin-Ya; Teng, Chiao-Fang; Chang, Wen-Tsan","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ecb1ed14f285199dfecf0d58428c53a42e2ccc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092908.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X06012162; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X06012162","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective siRNAs","effective gene silencing","targeting reporter gene","corresponding siRNAs","target gene expression","efficacy of designed siRNAs","gene silencing reagents","induced gene silencing","efficacy of siRNA","sequence-specific gene silencing","novel reporter-based siRNA validation system","novel gene function","quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system","triggering siRNA expression","limited number of siRNAs","expression vectors","comparative validating system","use of RNAi","expression of mouse matrix metalloproteinase","screening","addition","available short synthetic DNA fragment","latent membrane protein","enhanced green fluorescence protein","Barr virus","human hepatitis B virus","tumor suppressor protein p53","human serine","molecular therapeutics","powerful strategy","quantified readouts","surface antigen","HBsAg","HBV","reverse functional genomics","RNA interference","EGFP","EBV","LMP1","purpose","MMP","threonine kinase AKT1","Epstein","Abstract Small interfering RNAs","effectiveness","specificity","key challenge","identification","firefly luciferase","mechanism","mammals","inhibition","abilities","study"],"language":"en"},

One obstacle to controlling these epidemics is our poor understanding of the host range of filoviruses and their natural reservoirs. Here, we investigated the role of the intracellular filovirus receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) as a molecular determinant of Ebola virus (EBOV) host range at the cellular level. Whereas human cells can be infected by EBOV, a cell line derived from a Russell\u2019s viper (Daboia russellii) (VH-2) is resistant to infection in an NPC1-dependent manner. We found that VH-2 cells are resistant to EBOV infection because the Russell\u2019s viper NPC1 ortholog bound poorly to the EBOV spike glycoprotein (GP). Analysis of panels of viper-human NPC1 chimeras and point mutants allowed us to identify a single amino acid residue in NPC1, at position 503, that bidirectionally influenced both its binding to EBOV GP and its viral receptor activity in cells. Significantly, this single residue change perturbed neither NPC1\u2019s endosomal localization nor its housekeeping role in cellular cholesterol trafficking. Together with other recent work, these findings identify sequences in NPC1 that are important for viral receptor activity by virtue of their direct interaction with EBOV GP and suggest that they may influence filovirus host range in nature. Broader surveys of NPC1 orthologs from vertebrates may delineate additional sequence polymorphisms in this gene that control susceptibility to filovirus infection. IMPORTANCE Identifying cellular factors that determine susceptibility to infection can help us understand how Ebola virus is transmitted. We asked if the EBOV receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) could explain why reptiles are resistant to EBOV infection. We demonstrate that cells derived from the Russell\u2019s viper are not susceptible to infection because EBOV cannot bind to viper NPC1. This resistance to infection can be mapped to a single amino acid residue in viper NPC1 that renders it unable to bind to EBOV GP. The newly solved structure of EBOV GP bound to NPC1 confirms our findings, revealing that this residue dips into the GP receptor-binding pocket and is therefore critical to the binding interface. Consequently, this otherwise well-conserved residue in vertebrate species influences the ability of reptilian NPC1 proteins to bind to EBOV GP, thereby affecting viral host range in reptilian cells.","publish_time":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ndungo, Esther; Herbert, Andrew S.; Raaben, Matthijs; Obernosterer, Gregor; Biswas, Rohan; Miller, Emily Happy; Wirchnianski, Ariel S.; Carette, Jan E.; Brummelkamp, Thijn R.; Whelan, Sean P.; Dye, John M.; Chandran, Kartik","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3c43cf529fc26a2f6b039c7e2aa9f0825a9a19f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4894689.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00007-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27303731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Russell"],"organizations":["EBOV","EBOV GP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV infection","Russell\u2019s viper NPC1 ortholog","viper-human NPC1 chimeras","solved structure of EBOV GP","NPC1-dependent manner","filovirus infection","EBOV spike glycoprotein","EBOV receptor Niemann-Pick C1","ability of reptilian NPC1 proteins","Broader surveys of NPC1 orthologs","single residue","GP receptor-binding pocket","human cells","viral host range","filovirus host range","reptilian cells","viral receptor activity","host range of filoviruses","intracellular filovirus receptor","residue dips","single amino acid residue","well-conserved residue","human populations","current unprecedented Ebola virus disease","molecular determinant of Ebola virus","cellular factors","cellular level","susceptibility","findings","binding interface","VH","cellular cholesterol trafficking","housekeeping role","increasing number of disease outbreaks","EVD","vertebrates","virtue","s endosomal localization","vertebrate species","gene","additional sequence polymorphisms","direct interaction","sequences","causative agents","poor understanding","Daboia russellii","Analysis of panels","mutants","cell line","reptiles","western Africa","natural reservoirs","epidemics","recent work","IMPORTANCE","nature","position","obstacle","resistance"],"language":"en"},

Most point-of-care tests for detection of respiratory viruses have limitations in diagnostic performance and clinical usability. A novel, multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system (mariPOC(\u00AE); ArcDia International Oy Ltd., Turku, Finland) detects eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses) from a single nasopharyngeal swab specimen by a fully automated, random-access immunoassay method. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate mariPOC(\u00AE) point-of-care test system in comparison with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a pediatric emergency department setting. STUDY DESIGN: Prospectively collected samples from 158 children (mean age, 1.8 years) with respiratory symptoms and/or fever were analyzed both by mariPOC(\u00AE) and by multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS: The sensitivities and specificities (95% confidence intervals) of the mariPOC(\u00AE) test were for influenza A (n = 7), 71% (38\u2013100) and 100%; influenza B (n = 22), 86% (72\u2013100) and 98% (95\u2013100); RSV (n = 35), 89% (78\u201399) and 100%; adenovirus (n = 12), 25% (1\u201350) and 97% (95\u201399); and for human metapneumovirus (n = 8), 50% (15\u201385) and 100%, respectively. Parainfluenzaviruses were detected only in five patients.

Given its high capacity to change antigenically, acquired immunity is often not effective to limit IFV infection and therefore vaccination must be constantly redesigned to achieve effective protection. Improvement of respiratory and systemic innate immune mechanisms has been proposed to reduce the incidence and severity of IFV disease. In the last decade, several research works have demonstrated that microbes with the capacity to modulate the mucosal immune system (immunobiotics) are a potential alternative to beneficially modulate the outcome of IFV infection. This review provides an update of the current status on the modulation of respiratory immunity by orally and nasally administered immunobiotics, and their beneficial impact on IFV clearance and inflammatory-mediated lung tissue damage. In particular, we describe the research of our group that investigated the influence of immunobiotics on inflammation\u2013coagulation interactions during IFV infection. Studies have clearly demonstrated that hostile inflammation is accompanied by dysfunctional coagulation in respiratory IFV disease, and our investigations have proved that some immunobiotic strains are able to reduce viral disease severity through their capacity to modulate the immune-coagulative responses in the respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2016-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zelaya, Hortensia; Alvarez, Susana; Kitazawa, Haruki; Villena, Julio","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31cfa31a4d8a26ca083257be0e6dce51562d8c6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5179578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066442/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory IFV disease","IFV clearance","severity of IFV disease","outcome of IFV infection","Improvement of respiratory","respiratory tract","modulation of respiratory immunity","high capacity","administered immunobiotics","influence of immunobiotics","viral disease severity","major respiratory pathogen of global importance","immune-coagulative responses","mucosal immune system","dysfunctional coagulation","coagulation interactions","hostile inflammation","systemic innate immune mechanisms","research works","effective protection","high degree of morbidity","beneficial impact","inflammatory-mediated lung tissue damage","infants","elderly","mortality","cause","current status","investigations","high-risk populations","immunobiotic strains","potential alternative","immunocompromised hosts","update","microbes","group","incidence","Influenza virus","review","decade","Studies","vaccination"],"language":"en"},

Social distancing, i.e., reducing interactions between individuals in order to slow down the spread of the virus, has become the new norm. In this viewpoint I will discuss the potential implications of social distancing on daily travel patterns. Avoiding social contact might completely change the number and types of out-of-home activities people perform, and how people reach these activities. It can be expected that the demand for travel will reduce and that people will travel less by public transport. Social distancing might negatively affect subjective well-being and health status, as it might result in social isolation and limited physical activity. As a result, walking and cycling, recreationally or utilitarian, can be important ways to maintain satisfactory levels of health and well-being. Policymakers and planners should consequently try to encourage active travel, while public transport operators should focus on creating ways to safely use public transport.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Vos, Jonas","journal":"Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b7e2085bd242d85dfe22c5c14b185ead9bcca64.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220300324?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198220300324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social isolation","active travel","social contact","potential implications of social distancing","daily travel patterns","public transport operators","virus","home activities people","spread","result","activity participation","important ways","subjective well-being","health status","satisfactory levels of health","limited physical activity","unprecedented measures","interactions","order","utilitarian","number","countries","types","planners","individuals","viewpoint","cycling","new norm","COVID","Policymakers","demand"],"language":"en"},

Effective antibiotic stewardship must include proper prescribing for outpatients as well as for those in a hospital or long-term care facility. METHODS: Major databases, including MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, were searched for prospective human clinical studies, including children and/or adults published between January 1966 and November 2017 that evaluated Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker for diagnosing viral infections as well as both C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) as potential biomarkers for identifying and differentiating true bacterial upper respiratory infection (URI) from colonization. RESULTS: Ten prospective human studies, totaling 1683 patients, were identified that evaluated MxA as a viral biomarker in children and/or adults. Both systematic review articles, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled clinical trials that examined CRP and/or PCT as a biomarker for identifying clinically significant bacterial infections and supporting antibiotic stewardship were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Quick and accurate differentiation between a viral and bacterial respiratory infection is critical to effectively combat antibiotic misuse. MxA expression in peripheral blood is a highly specific marker for viral infection. Combining MxA with other inflammatory biomarkers to test for respiratory infections offers enhanced sensitivity and specificity, forming an excellent tool for antibiotic stewardship in the outpatient setting.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joseph, Patrick; Godofsky, Eliot","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01bc7fe59fc7feb0e3d23c716aa23a694a4362a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5815119.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofy024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29479553/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","viral biomarker","bacterial respiratory infection","acute respiratory infections","significant bacterial infections","Effective antibiotic stewardship","antibiotic misuse","MxA expression","true bacterial upper respiratory infection","CRP","prospective human clinical studies","prospective human studies","children","PCT","adults","outpatient primary","outpatient setting","potential biomarkers","inflammatory biomarkers","urgent care clinics","long-term care facility","C-reactive protein","Myxovirus resistance protein","randomized controlled clinical trials","meta-analyses","specificity","procalcitonin","URI","accurate differentiation","MEDLINE","peripheral blood","proper prescribing","specific marker","excellent tool","systematic review articles","enhanced sensitivity","majority of oral antibiotics","Cochrane Library","Major databases","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","hospital","outpatients","RESULTS","colonization"],"language":"en"},

This key step in viral entry delivers the viral genome into the cytoplasm for replication. Although class II fusion proteins are genetically and structurally unrelated to class I fusion proteins, they use the same physical principles and topology as other fusion proteins to drive membrane fusion. Exposure of a fusion loop first allows it to insert into the host-cell membrane. Conserved hydrophobic residues in the fusion loop act as an anchor, which penetrates only partway into the outer bilayer leaflet of the host-cell membrane. Subsequent folding back of the fusion protein on itself directs the C-terminal viral transmembrane anchor towards the fusion loop. This fold-back forces the host-cell membrane (held by the fusion loop) and the viral membrane (held by the C-terminal transmembrane anchor) against each other, resulting in membrane fusion. In class II fusion proteins, the fold-back is triggered by the reduced pH of an endosome, and is accompanied by the assembly of fusion protein monomers into trimers. The fold-back occurs by domain rearrangement rather than by an extensive refolding of secondary structure, but this domain rearrangement and the assembly of monomers into trimers together bury a large surface area. The energy that is thus released exerts a bending force on the apposed viral and cellular membranes, causing them to bend towards each other and, eventually, to fuse.","publish_time":"2013-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modis, Yorgo","journal":"Viral Entry into Host Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e6c265940cf28584b4a80816c1c9207aa7fc4f1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23884590/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7651-1_8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane fusion","fusion proteins","viral membrane","fusion loop act","host-cell membrane","assembly of fusion protein monomers","viral genome","viral entry","C-terminal viral transmembrane anchor","class","C-terminal transmembrane anchor","trimers","domain rearrangement","assembly of monomers","extensive refolding of secondary structure","outer bilayer leaflet","hydrophobic residues","physical principles","topology","forces","bending force","cellular membranes","key step","large surface area","cytoplasm","replication","Enveloped viruses","reduced pH","endosome","Exposure","energy"],"language":"en"},

There is currently no drug that has been proven as an effective therapy for COVID-19. Several candidate drugs are being considered and evaluated for treatment. This includes clinically-available drugs, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are being repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Novel experimental therapies, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, are also actively being investigated for antiviral efficacy. Clinically-available and investigational immunomodulators, such as the IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab and the anti-GMCSF lenzilumab, are being tested for their anticipated effect in counteracting the pro-inflammatory cytokine environment that characterizes severe and critical COVID-19. This review article examines the evidence behind the potential use of these leading drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. The authors conclude, based on this review, that there is still no high-quality evidence to support any of these proposed drug therapies. The authors, therefore, encourage the enrollment of eligible patients to multiple ongoing clinical trials that assess the efficacy and safety of these candidate therapies. Until the results of controlled trials are available, none of the suggested therapeutics is clinically proven as an effective therapy for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vijayvargiya, Prakhar; Garrigos, Zerelda Esquer; Castillo Almeida, Natalia E.; Gurram, Pooja R.; Stevens, Ryan W.; Razonable, Raymund R.","journal":"Mayo Clin Proc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4af3e50a061f1e6204c3442c4a37c1077d341333.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620303979?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620303979","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","critical COVID","available drugs","candidate therapies","proposed drug therapies","Novel experimental therapies","effective therapy","candidate drugs","authors","leading drug candidates","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","antiviral efficacy","high-quality evidence","review article","fatal coronavirus disease","results of controlled trials","multiple ongoing clinical trials","sarilumab","pro-inflammatory cytokine environment","enrollment of eligible patients","potential use","inhibitors tocilizumab","anti-GMCSF lenzilumab","hydroxychloroquine","remdesivir","safety","anticipated effect","lopinavir","investigational immunomodulators","worldwide pandemic","suggested therapeutics","ritonavir","favipiravir"],"language":"en"},

A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

As with the other members in the group 1, theses viruses are also known to use the host aminopeptidase N (APN) as the major receptor for cell entry. Remarkably, it was found that they utilize distinct cultured cell lines for in vitro virus propagation, since PEDV could not be replicated in swine testis (ST) cells expressing native porcine APN (pAPN), which are highly susceptible to TGEV. To explain the mechanism causing this discrimination, we postulated that there may be a correlation between the pAPN expression level and PEDV infection. As a first step toward understanding the role of cellular receptor density in PEDV replication, therefore, sub-lines of ST cells stably overexpressing recombinant pAPN were generated. We initially confirmed that the control ST cells do express relatively low levels of endogenous pAPN. In contrast, in the engineered stable cell lines, a high level of recombinant pAPN expression was demonstrated. The introduction of a pAPN gene into nonpermissive ST cells was further found to be fully sufficient to support productive infection, revealing that constitutive overexpression of pAPN can directly rescue PEDV multiplication. We further assessed whether the pAPN enzymatic function is relevant to PEDV infection. The enzymatic active motif-null mutant pAPN still retained the ability to exert its receptor activity and consequently, to cause infectious virus production. Moreover, the only APN inhibitor blocking the protease activity site had no obvious negative effect on viral infection, indicating that the enzymatic role of APN is dispensable for the process of virus replication. Taken together, our results suggest that pAPN receptor density appears to be an important factor in contributing to efficient PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2010-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nam, Eeuri; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a8beb9701800db457b815f4455e2592df3dd835.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117352.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509006166; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.12.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509006166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20074871/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","APN","TGEV","ST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pAPN gene","pAPN receptor density","pAPN expression level","pAPN enzymatic function","PEDV replication","efficient PEDV infection","PEDV multiplication","constitutive overexpression of pAPN","viral infection","high level of recombinant pAPN expression","low levels of endogenous pAPN","sub-lines of ST cells","nonpermissive ST cells","enzymatic role of APN","control ST cells","virus propagation","productive infection","receptor activity","enzymatic active motif-null mutant pAPN","process of virus replication","APN inhibitor","major receptor","native porcine APN","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","infectious virus production","role of cellular receptor density","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","engineered stable cell lines","distinct cultured cell lines","cell entry","group","TGEV","important viral pathogens","important factor","lethal diarrhea","protease activity site","obvious negative effect","pigs","ability","coronaviruses","swine testis","host aminopeptidase N","contrast","introduction","correlation","results","theses viruses","members","step","mechanism","discrimination"],"language":"en"},

PARV4 is a recently identified virus detected in human blood and variety of tissues, but its disease association with SARI could not be established. OBJECTIVE: In the present case control study, we aim to investigate the association of PARV4 with SARI. METHODS: The Nasal and Throat swab (NS/TS) samples of 241 cases and 146 healthy controls were tested for most common respiratory viruses and PARV4 by real-time PCR. RESULTS: PARV4 was detected in 64(26.55%) SARI cases and only one healthy control (0.68%). PARV4 was the most common viral agent detected in SARI cases. A strong association of PARV4 is seen with severe respiratory illness. CONCLUSION: Detection of PARV4 in a significantly higher number of SARI cases, in comparison with controls, suggests association of PARV4 with SARI. PARV4 genotype 2 is the only circulating strain detected in our study.","publish_time":"2019-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prakash, Shantanu; Shukla, Suruchi; Ramakrishna, Vangala; Mishra, Hricha; Bhagat, Amit K.; Jain, Amita","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40ee23685395d5bca3db0f4946e5ce7b1c6003f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172059.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971219303935; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303935; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Detection of PARV4","PARV4 genotype","strong association of PARV4","higher number of SARI cases","disease association","common respiratory viruses","severe respiratory illness","healthy controls","Severe Acute Respiratory Infection","common viral agent","large number of viral","present case control study","Throat swab","NS","variety of tissues","samples","comparison","real-time PCR","mortality","Nasal","human blood","important cause of morbidity","bacterial agents","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","strain","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this manuscript is to describe the development process of the data set for the National Spinal Cord Injury Registry of Iran (NSCIR-IR). SETTING: SCI community in Iran. METHODS: The NSCIR-IR data set was developed in 8 months, from March 2015 to October 2015. An expert panel of 14 members was formed. After a review of data sets of similar registries in developed countries, the selection and modification of the basic framework were performed over 16 meetings, based on the objectives and feasibility of the registry. RESULTS: The final version of the data set was composed of 376 data elements including sociodemographic, hospital admission, injury incidence, prehospital procedures, emergency department visit, medical history, vertebral injury, spinal cord injury details, interventions, complications, and discharge data. It also includes 163 components of the International Standards for the Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) and 65 data elements related to quality of life, pressure ulcers, pain, and spasticity. CONCLUSION: The NSCIR-IR data set was developed in order to meet the quality improvement objectives of the registry. The process was centered around choosing the data elements assessing care provided to individuals in the acute and chronic phases of SCI in hospital settings. The International Spinal Cord Injury Data Set was selected as a basic framework, helped by comparison with data from other countries. Expert panel modifications facilitated the implementation of the registry process with the current clinical workflow in hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azadmanjir, Zahra; Jazayeri, Seyed Behzad; Habibi Arejan, Roya; Ghodsi, Zahra; Sharif-Alhoseini, Mahdi; Kheiri, Ghazaleh; Zendehdel, Kazem; Safdarian, Mahdi; Sadeghian, Farideh; Khazaeipour, Zahra; Naghdi, Khatereh; Arab Kheradmand, Jalil; Saadat, Soheil; Pirnejad, Habibollah; Fazel, Mohammad Reza; Fakharian, Esmail; Mohammadzadeh, Mahdi; Sadeghi-Naini, Mohsen; Saberi, Houshang; Derakhshan, Pegah; Sabour, Hadis; Benzel, Edward C.; Oreilly, Gerard; Noonan, Vanessa; Vaccaro, Alexander R.; Emami-Razavi, Seyed Hassan; Rahimi-Movaghar, Vafa","journal":"Spinal Cord Ser Cases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f369ea213e7bf56f55a40d910e7b0f5419b3a7f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Spinal Cord Injury Registry","SCI","International Standards","International Spinal Cord Injury Data Set"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["data elements","discharge data","NSCIR-IR data set","International Spinal Cord Injury Data Set","spinal cord injury details","vertebral injury","injury incidence","National Spinal Cord Injury Registry of Iran","registry process","Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury","review of data sets of similar registries","developed countries","basic framework","quality improvement objectives","development process","Expert panel modifications","hospital admission","hospital settings","quality of life","International Standards","SCI community","STUDY DESIGN","Descriptive study","chronic phases of SCI","emergency department visit","prehospital procedures","medical history","interventions","individuals","selection","complications","order","ISNCSCI","pressure ulcers","current clinical workflow","implementation","pain","manuscript","care","final version","comparison","spasticity","hospitals","meetings","METHODS","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","components","aim","members","feasibility","months"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre for ECMO. PATIENTS: 115 patients treated with ECMO for refractory heart failure and 57 patients treated with ECMO for refractory respiratory failure. METHODS: We analysed the association between early daily FB versus hospital and 90-day mortality using multivariable logistic regression model, Cox proportional-hazards model and propensity score. RESULTS: We obtained detailed demographic, clinical, and biochemical data, daily FB, and continuous renal replacement days. Fifty-seven per cent of patients had acute kidney injury (AKI) at ECMO initiation, and 60 % (n = 103) of patients received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) during ECMO course, beginning at a median of 1 (0\u20133.5) days after ECMO initiation. Overall 90-day mortality was 24 %. Survivors exhibited lower daily FB from day 3 to day 5. After adjustments, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III, CRRT during the first 3 days, major bleeding event at day 1 and positive FB on day 3 were independent predictors of 90-day mortality. Positive FB at ECMO day 3 remained an independent predictor of hospital and 90-day mortality, regardless of the statistical model used or the inclusion of a propensity score to have positive FB. CONCLUSIONS: Positive FB at ECMO day 3 is an independent predictor of 90-day mortality. Further interventional studies aimed at testing the value of strategy of tight control of FB during the early ECMO period are now warranted.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to summarize the incidence of IPF infection secondary to influenza virus infection and further explore its etiologic mechanism and high-risk factors. METHODS: All adult patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1) virus infection admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of Nanjing Drum Hospital from November 2017 to March 2018 were retrospectively selected. The differences in baseline factors, risk factors, immune function and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPF. RESULTS: Of the 19 critically ill patients with H1N1 infection, 11 (57.9%) developed IPF infection after 7 days of ICU admission. Two patients had proven and nine probable IPF infection. A difference in human leukocyte antigen\u2013DR isotype (\u25B3HLA-DR; day 7\u2013day 1) was found between the two groups. \u25B3HLA-DR (day 7\u2013day 1) was higher in patients with no IPF infection than in those with IPF infection [(14.52 \u00B1 14.21)% vs ( \u2212 11.74 \u00B1 20.22)%, P = 0.019]. The decline in HLA-DR indicated impaired immune function secondary to fungal infection in patients with H1N1 infection. CONCLUSIONS: IPF infection was diagnosed in 57.9% of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 7 days following ICU admission. A continuous decline in immune function could lead to the development of IPF infections.

METHODS: Retrospective study of all HIV-infected patients (n = 147) admitted to a single intensive care unit (ICU) for ARF between 1996 and 2006. RESULTS: ARF revealed the diagnosis of HIV infection in 43 (29.2%) patients. Causes of ARF were bacterial pneumonia (n = 74), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP, n = 52), other opportunistic infections (n = 19), and noninfectious pulmonary disease (n = 33); the distribution of causes did not change over the 10-year study period. Two or more causes were identified in 33 patients. The 43 patients on ART more frequently had bacterial pneumonia and less frequently had opportunistic infections (P = 0.02). Noninvasive ventilation was needed in 49 patients and endotracheal intubation in 42. Hospital mortality was 19.7%. Factors independently associated with mortality were mechanical ventilation [odds ratio (OR) = 8.48, P \u003C 0.0001], vasopressor use (OR, 4.48; P = 0.03), time from hospital admission to ICU admission (OR, 1.05 per day; P = 0.01), and number of causes (OR, 3.19; P = 0.02). HIV-related variables (CD4 count, viral load, and ART) were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacterial pneumonia and PCP remain the leading causes of ARF in HIV-infected patients in the ART era. Hospital survival has improved, and depends on the extent of organ dysfunction rather than on HIV-related characteristics.","publish_time":"2009-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barbier, Fran\u00E7ois; Coquet, Isaline; Legriel, St\u00E9phane; Pavie, Juliette; Darmon, Michael; Mayaux, Julien; Molina, Jean-Michel; Schlemmer, Beno\u00EEt; Azoulay, \u00C9lie","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a9f85e4f1575fe852d130b388a2d8e03e0f2e82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094937.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzUxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARF","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV-infected patients","leading causes of ARF","bacterial pneumonia","HIV-related variables","HIV-related characteristics","Hospital mortality","number of causes","distribution of causes","diagnosis of HIV infection","ART era","hospital admission","PCP","ICU admission","Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia","opportunistic infections","Hospital survival","mechanical ventilation","Retrospective study","vasopressor use","Noninvasive ventilation","year study period","CD4 count","viral load","outcome of acute respiratory failure","decade of combination antiretroviral therapy","etiologies","time","single intensive care unit","odds ratio","noninfectious pulmonary disease","extent of organ dysfunction","METHODS","CONCLUSION","Factors","RESULTS","endotracheal intubation","day","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

However, there is still a need for reliable disease burden estimates to provide a more detailed picture of the impact of influenza. Therefore, the objectives of this study is to estimate the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza virus infection and associated hospitalisation costs in adult patients in the Netherlands during two consecutive influenza seasons. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection in three Dutch hospitals during respiratory seasons 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016. Incidence was calculated as the weekly number of hospitalised influenza patients divided by the total population in the catchment populations of the three hospitals. Arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were estimated and included costs for emergency department consultation, diagnostics, general ward and/or intensive care unit admission, isolation, antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment. These hospitalisation costs were extrapolated to national level and expressed in 2017 euros. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 380 hospitalised adult influenza patients. The seasonal cumulative incidence was 3.5 cases per 10,000 persons in respiratory season 2014\u20132015, compared to 1.8 cases per 10,000 persons in 2015\u20132016. The arithmetic mean hospitalisation cost per influenza patient was \u20AC6128 (95% CI \u20AC4934\u2013\u20AC7737) per patient in 2014\u20132015 and \u20AC8280 (95% CI \u20AC6254\u2013\u20AC10,665) in 2015\u20132016, potentially reaching total hospitalisation costs of \u20AC28 million in 2014\u20132015 and \u20AC20 million in 2015\u20132016. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus infections lead to 1.8\u20133.5 hospitalised patients per 10,000 persons, with mean hospitalisation costs of \u20AC6100\u2013\u20AC8300 per adult patient, resulting in 20\u201328 million euros annually in The Netherlands. The highest arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were found in the 45\u201364 year age group. These influenza burden estimates could be used for future influenza cost-effectiveness and impact studies.

Design: Prospective randomized controlled study. Setting: Two intensive care units, university hospital and county hospital, respectively. Patients: Twenty-two critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Interventions: Albumin synthesis was measured twice in each patient, with a 5-day interval. The patients in the control group (n=11) received standard intensive care unit (ICU) treatment between measurements, whereas those in the GH group (n=11) also received 0.3 U/kg daily of human recombinant GH. Measurements and results: Albumin synthesis was measured by labeling with L-[(2)H(5)]phenylalanine. In the control group, the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of albumin was 16.3\u00B14.1%/day (mean and SD) in the first measurement and 15.7\u00B14.2%/day 5 days later (NS), whereas in the GH group the corresponding values were 17.0\u00B14.7%/day and 16.7\u00B15.5%/day (NS). The calculated absolute synthesis rates of albumin, based on FSR and intravascular albumin mass, also showed no effect of GH. Conclusion: Albumin synthesis rates were consistently higher in the two groups of critically ill patients than previously reported values in healthy subjects. However, GH treatment for 5 days neither stimulated nor inhibited albumin synthesis rates in these critically ill patients.","publish_time":"2001-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barle, Hans; Gamrin, Lena; Ess\u00E9n, Pia; McNurlan, Margaret A.; Garlick, Peter J.; Wernerman, Jan","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19bb9ba61969ea1e5dbcae13382cecb845064a9e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ill patients","GH group","inhibited albumin synthesis rates","calculated absolute synthesis rates of albumin","effect of GH","GH treatment","intravascular albumin mass","fractional synthesis rate","control group","day interval","human recombinant GH","intensive care units","standard intensive care unit","FSR","measurements","days","university hospital","county hospital","reported values","corresponding values","effect of growth hormone","Prospective randomized controlled study","ICU","Design","healthy subjects","Setting","groups","results","Conclusion","SD","Interventions","phenylalanine","Objective"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study in a single-center bed pediatric intensive care unit serving two Dutch provinces. PATIENTS: 533 mechanically ventilated children aged 0\u201316 years, all of whom met the North-American European Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Chest radiographs were screened for the novel presence of bilateral infiltrates, in patients with bilateral infiltrates the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was calculated on two separate consecutive measurements. If below 200, the patient was classified as having ARDS. Left ventricular dysfunction was ruled out by echocardiography. The incidence was calculated by obtaining the number of children aged 0\u201316 years in our region. For each patient it was noted whether the patient was currently considered to have ARDS. Forty-one patients (7.7%) met the criteria for ARDS, with an incidence of 2.2 per 100,000 per year. The mortality rate was 20.4%. Thirty patients (73.1%) had primary ARDS, mainly from viral lower respiratory tract disease. Only ten patients (24.4%) currently had ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pediatric ARDS is low compared to that of adult ARDS, and further underestimated as most patients were diagnosed by their underlying diseases.","publish_time":"2008-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kneyber, Martin C.

METHODS: Seven areas of donor management were considered for this review: hemodynamic management; fluids and electrolytes; respiratory management; endocrine management; temperature management; anaemia and coagulation; infection management. For each subchapter, a narrative review was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Most elements in the current recommendations and guidelines are based on pathophysiological reasoning, epidemiological observations, or extrapolations from general ICU management strategies, and not on evidence from randomized controlled trials. The cardiorespiratory management of brain-dead donors is very similar to the management of critically ill patients, and the same applies to the management of anaemia and coagulation. Central diabetes insipidus is of particular concern, and should be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Depending on the degree of vasopressor dependency, it can be treated with intermittent desmopressin or continuous vasopressin, intravenously. Temperature management of the donor is an area of uncertainty, but it appears reasonable to strive for a core temperature of \u003E 35 \u00B0C. The indications and controversies regarding endocrine therapies, in particular thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and corticosteroid therapy, are discussed. The potential donor should be assessed clinically for infections, and screening tests for specific infections are an essential part of donor management. Although the rate of infection transmission from donor to receptor is low, certain infections are still a formal contraindication to organ donation. However, new antiviral drugs and strategies now allow organ donation from certain infected donors to be done safely.","publish_time":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyfroidt, Geert; Gunst, Jan; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Smith, Martin; Robba, Chiara; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Citerio, Giuseppe","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95b79f7962e0f20daf47e7aa600a012390aed444.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095373.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["temperature management","endocrine management","management of anaemia","infection management","hemodynamic management","areas of donor management","general ICU management strategies","cardiorespiratory management of brain-dead donors","potential donor","potential organ donor","certain infections","organ donation","specific infections","coagulation","core temperature","certain infected donors","endocrine therapies","particular concern","corticosteroid therapy","narrative review","particular thyroid hormone replacement therapy","rate of infection transmission","extrapolations","electrolytes","receptor","fluids","epidemiological observations","elements","guidelines","pathophysiological reasoning","evidence","formal contraindication","intensive care unit","screening tests","current recommendations","Central diabetes insipidus","controversies","new antiviral drugs","practical overview","intermittent desmopressin","continuous vasopressin","CONCLUSIONS","randomized controlled trials","indications","area of uncertainty","METHODS","ill patients","degree of vasopressor dependency","RESULTS","PURPOSE","subchapter","clinical criteria"],"language":"en"},

A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the SARS pathogen(4,5,6,7), which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure(8). Moreover, among infected individuals influenza such as the Spanish flu(9,10) and the emergence of new respiratory disease viruses(11,12) have caused high lethality resulting from acute lung failure(13). In cell lines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a potential SARS-CoV receptor(14). The high lethality of SARS-CoV infections, its enormous economic and social impact, fears of renewed outbreaks as well as the potential misuse of such viruses as biologic weapons make it paramount to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. Here we provide the first genetic proof that ACE2 is a crucial SARS-CoV receptor in vivo. SARS-CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression. Notably, injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo that can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway. These results provide a molecular explanation why SARS-CoV infections cause severe and often lethal lung failure and suggest a rational therapy for SARS and possibly other respiratory disease viruses.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate emotional distress, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cognitive performance. The diagnosis of HIV was considered a life event that may lead to post-traumatic stress syndrome. METHOD: We recruited 37 HIV-positive outpatients and assessed the frequency of depressive (BDI) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) due to the diagnosis of HIV (IES), HRQoL (SF-36) and cognitive performance (SKT). Further, the new diagnostic concept of adjustment disorder as a stress response syndrome according to Maercker was considered. RESULTS: Of the 37 Patients, 67.6% (n=25) of the sample had a post-traumatic stress syndrome. The HIV-related PTSS was considered adjustment disorder using the concept proposed by Maercker. Fourteen patients (37.8%) suffered from a depressive syndrome, and 27% (n=10) showed cognitive deficits (minimal: n=8; mild: n=1; moderate: n =1). HIV-positive patients with PTSS had significantly unfavourable values in the SF-36 domains general health (p=0.003), vitality (p=0.007), social functioning (p=0.000), role-emotional (p=0.016) and mental health (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: HIV-infected patients may face a major risk of HIV-related PTSS in the sense of adjustment disorder according to Maercker, depression and cognitive dysfunction. The presence of emotional distress is associated with impairments in quality of life. We therefore suggest an early and comprehensive bio-psycho-social assessment and therapy of HIV-infected patients.","publish_time":"2010-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baumschlager, D.; Haas-Krammer, A.; Rothenh\u00E4usler, H.-B.","journal":"Nervenarzt","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1bb388e039297e8d4032fa9a7f2cd3c7fe56d17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095816.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Maercker"],"organizations":["HIV","PTSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of HIV","HIV-related PTSS","HIV-infected patients","HIV-positive patients","therapy of HIV","change of HIV disease","HIV-positive outpatients","major risk of HIV","post-traumatic stress syndrome","stress response syndrome","Maercker","depressive syndrome","cognitive performance","post-traumatic stress symptoms","health-related quality of life","cognitive deficits","cognitive dysfunction","sense of adjustment disorder","new diagnostic concept of adjustment disorder","life event","HRQoL","presence of emotional distress","mental health","role-emotional","domains general health","social assessment","social functioning","frequency of depressive","acute life-threatening disease","BDI","comprehensive bio-psycho","chronic infection","unfavourable values","depression","sample","exploratory study","impairments","IES","CONCLUSION","therapeutic aspects","purpose","SKT","vitality","scientific investigations","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To compare the acid\u2010base changes in dogs with parvoviral enteritis (PE) using the Henderson\u2010Hasselbalch (HH) approach, with 2 strong ion approaches. ANIMALS: Forty\u2010four dogs with PE, and 16 age\u2010matched control dogs. METHODS: Prospective controlled observational study. Acid\u2010base status was evaluated using the HH model, Fencl\u2010Stewart (FS) approach and a validated strong ion model (VDM). The acid\u2010base changes according to each model were classified and compared. Statistical correlations between pH, CO(2), and various SIM variables were performed, as well as between the sum of effects (SOE) of the SIM and the individual variables comprising the SOE. RESULTS: The HH model identified acid\u2010base disorders in 31/44 cases of which 16/31 were mixed with metabolic acidosis and concurrent respiratory alkalosis the most common (10/31). Using the FS approach, metabolic changes were present 36/42 cases, with changes in free water (FW), chloride, and unmeasured anions (UA) being the most prevalent. Both FW and UA correlated well with pH; however, UA were most consistently abnormal in severe acidemia. Similarly to the HH, the VDM detected acid\u2010base disturbances in 28/44 cases. Major contributors to the acid\u2010base changes were hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and A(tot) acidosis because of elevated globulins and increased UA. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Acid\u2010base changes are common and complex in dogs with PE, and were easier to understand using a SIM paradigm. Increases in UA have not been documented in PE in dogs.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burchell, Richard K.; Gal, Arnon; Friedlein, Ryan; Leisewitz, Andrew L.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/770fa5d625006e3e368b7b95aa08dacf60ecceeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096617.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzgxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIM","SOE","UA","VDM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["base changes","base disturbances","base disorders","characterization of acid","base status","HH model","metabolic changes","validated strong ion model","cases","SIM paradigm","increased UA","FS approach","strong ion approaches","matched control dogs","various SIM variables","metabolic acidosis","complex disorders","VDM","FW","SOE","pH","alternative paradigm","individual variables","chloride","parvoviral enteritis","concurrent respiratory alkalosis","elevated globulins","free water","age","Fencl","Stewart","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","METHODS","Prospective controlled observational study","tot","hypochloremia","Henderson\u2010Hasselbalch","hyponatremia","unmeasured anions","Major contributors","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","severe acidemia","sum of effects","Statistical correlations","OBJECTIVES","ANIMALS","HYPOTHESIS"],"language":"en"},

Mutations in several genes can cause DCM, including genes encoding structural components of the sarcomere and desmosome. Nongenetic forms of DCM can result from different aetiologies, including inflammation of the myocardium due to an infection (mostly viral); exposure to drugs, toxins or allergens; and systemic endocrine or autoimmune diseases. The heterogeneous aetiology and clinical presentation of DCM make a correct and timely diagnosis challenging. Echocardiography and other imaging techniques are required to assess ventricular dysfunction and adverse myocardial remodelling, and immunological and histological analyses of an endomyocardial biopsy sample are indicated when inflammation or infection is suspected. As DCM eventually leads to impaired contractility, standard approaches to prevent or treat heart failure are the first-line treatment for patients with DCM. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillators may be required to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. In addition, identifying the probable cause of DCM helps tailor specific therapies to improve prognosis.

We found here that production of the cytokine IL-15 by FRCs was essential for the maintenance of group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in Peyer\u0027s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, FRC-specific ablation of the innate immunological sensing adaptor MyD88 unleashed IL-15 production by FRCs during infection with an enteropathogenic virus, which led to hyperactivation of group 1 ILCs and substantially altered the differentiation of helper T cells. Accelerated clearance of virus by group 1 ILCs precipitated severe intestinal inflammatory disease with commensal dysbiosis, loss of intestinal barrier function and diminished resistance to colonization. In sum, FRCs act as an \u0027on-demand\u0027 immunological \u0027rheostat\u0027 by restraining activation of group 1 ILCs and thereby preventing immunopathological damage in the intestine.

These differences would suggest that planning for a disaster death and planning for a pandemic death should be done separately. This may be true to some extent, however, there are many similarities between the two that this article will seeks to examine. The main objective of this study is to show that planning for both disasters and pandemics should either be done by a single entity that coordinates both types of responses, or by agencies that communicate closely and frequently. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study compared mass death incidents predominantly within the Canadian historical record, including disasters and pandemics. It took a specific look at the influenza pandemic of 1918 in North America and how the dead were handled. FINDINGS: Both disasters and pandemics offer unique challenges in handling the dead and documenting the incident. In a pandemic the cause of death is usually clear, while in a disaster it is not always understood. However, the similarities they hold in common must not be overlooked. They will involve immense and complicated amounts of paperwork, cause a shortage of supplies (be it medical, food or otherwise) and create the need for assistance.

During 2015\u20132016 a cross-sectional study on 234 randomly-selected farms investigated the prevalence, patterns of, and factors associated with, antibodies to RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock in an area heavily affected by that outbreak. A RVFV inhibition ELISA was used to screen 977 cattle, 1,549 sheep and 523 goats and information on potential risk factors was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire. The estimated RVFV seroprevalence, adjusted for survey design, was 42.9% in cattle, 28.0% in sheep and 9.3% in goats, showing a high degree of farm-level clustering. Seroprevalence increased with age and was higher on private vs. communal land, on farms with seasonal pans (temporary, shallow wetlands) and perennial rivers and in recently vaccinated animals.

A recent direction in drug development is the utilization of nucleic acidbased therapeutic molecules, such as antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are endogenous, short, non-coding RNA molecules. Some viruses encode their own miRNAs, which play pivotal roles in viral replication and immune evasion strategies. Conversely, viruses that do not encode miRNAs may manipulate host cell miRNAs for the benefits of their replication. miRNAs have therefore become attractive tools for the study of viral pathogenesis. Lately, novel therapeutic strategies based on miRNA technology for the treatment of viral diseases have been progressing rapidly. Although this new generation of molecular therapy is promising, there are still several challenges to face, such as targeting delivery to specific tissues, avoiding off-target effects of miRNAs, reducing the toxicity of the drugs, and overcoming mutations and drug resistance. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the role and therapeutic potential of miRNAs in viral diseases, and discuss the limitations of these therapies, as well as strategies to overcome them to provide safe and effective clinical applications of these new therapeutics.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemida, Maged Gomaa; Ye, Xin; Thair, Simone; Yang, Decheng","journal":"Mol Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb592cea3efc9513796a2376184d38cd54c1d36f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099301.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099301/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic potential of miRNAs","viral replication","treatment of viral diseases","viral infections","target effects of miRNAs","host cell miRNAs","novel therapeutic strategies","New therapeutic approaches","cardiovascular diseases","serious diseases","study of viral pathogenesis","new therapeutics","viruses","utilization of nucleic acidbased therapeutic molecules","short interfering RNA","immune evasion strategies","non-coding RNA molecules","miRNA technology","drug development","drug resistance","new generation of molecular therapy","antisense oligonucleotides","ribozymes","siRNA","cancer","pivotal roles","effective clinical applications","current knowledge","attractive tools","benefits","specific tissues","recent direction","delivery","mutations","drugs","microRNA","toxicity","limitations","face","article","therapies","challenges"],"language":"en"},

Global disparities in health; medication safety; climate change; epidemics of obesity and diabetes; an aging world demographic; and emerging infections all represent problems requiring scientific solutions. The solutions to these problems, like the solutions to those in the last century that contributed so greatly to our quality of life, will require paradigm-shifting innovation. To maximize individual innovative potential, one strategy is formal instruction in the methods of innovative thinking. Teaching innovative thinking is rarely integrated into science training. However 40 years of accumulated evidence suggests that formal instruction results in improved thinking skills. I describe here some of the methods integrated into a course for graduate and professional health science students entitled Innovative Thinking. The curriculum consists of three components: recognizing and finding alternatives to habitual cognitive patterns; learning to use tools that enhance idea generation and originality; and harmonizing divergent thinking with the process of convergent thinking that is central to the scientific method. To build more innovative environments, institutions can promote team science, fund staged scientific designs that are heavy on early prototypes, reward and grow the training programs of past innovators, and become less risk averse. Although public health has accomplished much, it must continue to battle major, growing causes of disease and disability. Innovation is the engine of scientific discovery. Releasing the great potential for discovery in all of us must be central to forwarding health and prosperity in the world.","publish_time":"2011-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ness, Roberta B.","journal":"Public Health Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/076feb39425f8db536d1924a619909dc8aa7ad07.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["methods of innovative thinking","century of innovative public health discoveries","divergent thinking","innovative environments","scientific solutions","individual innovative potential","professional health science students","greatest public health challenges","process of convergent thinking","improved thinking skills","scientific designs","science training","scientific method","engine of scientific discovery","formal instruction","team science","problems","innovation","great potential","aging world demographic","training programs of past innovators","medication safety","climate change","emerging infections","epidemics of obesity","diabetes","fund","graduate","strategy","tools","reward","early prototypes","originality","mankind\u2019s history","institutions","course","alternatives","growing causes of disease","Global disparities","habitual cognitive patterns","years of accumulated evidence","idea generation","future holds","world\u2019s population","disability","paradigm","prosperity","healthier lives","risk averse","components","quality of life","curriculum"],"language":"en"},

Evidence of lyssavirus circulation has recently emerged in Southeast Asian bats. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Thailand to assess rabies-related knowledge and practices among persons regularly exposed to bats and bat habitats. The objectives were to identify deficiencies in rabies awareness, describe the occurrence of bat exposures, and explore factors associated with transdermal bat exposures. METHODS: A survey was administered to a convenience sample of adult guano miners, bat hunters, game wardens, and residents/personnel at Buddhist temples where mass bat roosting occurs. The questionnaire elicited information on demographics, experience with bat exposures, and rabies knowledge. Participants were also asked to describe actions they would take in response to a bat bite as well as actions for a bite from a potentially rabid animal. Bivariate analysis was used to compare responses between groups and multivariable logistic regression was used to explore factors independently associated with being bitten or scratched by a bat. FINDINGS: Of 106 people interviewed, 11 (10%) identified bats as a potential source of rabies. A history of a bat bite or scratch was reported by 29 (27%), and 38 (36%) stated either that they would do nothing or that they did not know what they would do in response to a bat bite. Guano miners were less likely than other groups to indicate animal bites as a mechanism of rabies transmission (68% vs. 90%, p = 0.03) and were less likely to say they would respond appropriately to a bat bite or scratch (61% vs. 27%, p = 0.003). Guano mining, bat hunting, and being in a bat cave or roost area more than 5 times a year were associated with history of a bat bite or scratch. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the need for educational outreach to raise awareness of bat rabies, promote exposure prevention, and ensure appropriate health-seeking behaviors for bat-inflicted wounds, particularly among at-risk groups in Thailand.","publish_time":"2011-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robertson, Kis; Lumlertdacha, Boonlert; Franka, Richard; Petersen, Brett; Bhengsri, Saithip; Henchaichon, Sununta; Peruski, Leonard F.; Baggett, Henry C.; Maloney, Susan A.; Rupprecht, Charles E.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d94872b6508c7d1b3bf580ff888aa862047ded07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3125144.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21738801/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["bat bite","bat hunters","bat hunting","bat cave","bat habitats","awareness of bat rabies","occurrence of bat exposures","transdermal bat exposures","bat-inflicted wounds","mass bat roosting","rabies awareness","rabies knowledge","rabies-related knowledge","mechanism of rabies transmission","potential source of rabies","scratch","at-risk groups","history","Guano mining","Thailand","factors","FINDINGS","actions","Southeast Asian bats","convenience sample of adult guano miners","animal bites","rabid animal","personnel","experience","game wardens","residents","responses","Buddhist temples","demographics","exposure prevention","educational outreach","need","behaviors","appropriate health","practices","persons","multivariable logistic regression","roost area","questionnaire elicited information","times","fatal encephalitis","Evidence of lyssavirus circulation","survey","year","BACKGROUND","deficiencies","Bivariate analysis","lyssaviruses","cross-sectional study","CONCLUSIONS","objectives","METHODS","people","Participants"],"language":"en"},

One major action is their ability to trigger production of massive amounts of interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), also referred to as natural IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 producing cells (NIPC). The present study using porcine PBMC activated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA revealed a considerable variation in the IFN-\u03B1 production in response to various CpG-ODN constructs. Several phosphodiester ODNs, such as 5\u2032 TTTTCAATTCGAAGATGAAT 3\u2032 (ODN H), and the plasmid pcDNA3 all required pre-incubation with lipofectin in order to induce IFN-\u03B1. Intact unmethylated CpGs were also important, because methylation or substitution of the cytosines and CpG-inversion strongly reduced the IFN-\u03B1 induction by single- or double-stranded forms of ODN H. Certain CpG-ODNs that contained flanking phosphorothioate or phosphodiester poly-G sequences were potent inducers of IFN-\u03B1 without pre-incubation with lipofectin, for instance the ODN 2216 (5\u2032 GGGGGACGATCGTCGGGGGG 3\u2032). While poly-G sequences have been suggested to increase uptake of ODNs by cells, they did not obviate the need for lipofectin when added to the ODN H. However, they resulted in up to five-fold increases of the IFN-\u03B1 levels caused by ODN H upon lipofection, indicating other enhancing effects of poly-G sequences on the induction of IFN-\u03B1. The identity of the IFN-\u03B1 producing cells (IPC) stimulated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA was studied by means of flow cytometry using combined staining for intracellular IFN-\u03B1 and surface markers. Approximately 1\u20133 IPC/10(3) PBMC were detected, compared to only 3 IPC/10(4) PBMC stimulated by Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus. The IPC frequencies were confirmed by detection of IFN-\u03B1 mRNA positive cells by in situ hybridisation. The IPC induced by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA had a similar phenotype, expressing CD2 and CD4 and intermediate levels of MHC class II and the myeloid marker SWC3, but not the markers of T and B cells or monocytes (CD3, CD21 and CD14). Consequently, porcine IPC that respond to CpG-DNA seem to correspond to the PDC/NIPC.","publish_time":"2004-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domeika, Kristina; Magnusson, Mattias; Eloranta, Maija-Leena; Fuxler, Lisbeth; Alm, Gunnar V.; Fossum, Caroline","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ed06e6ddd6b107ca9a79aafe02388132873abe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125693.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704001333; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704001333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG","ODN H.

We observed that such detection was hampered in diarrheic stool specimens and we set-up an improved protocol combining lyophilization of stools prior to a semi-automated DNA extraction. FINDINGS: A total of 41 human diarrheic stool specimens comprising of 35 specimens negative for enteropathogens and six specimens positive for Salmonella enterica in culture, were prospectively studied. One 1-mL aliquot of each specimen was lyophilised and total DNA was extracted from lyophilised and non-lyophilised aliquots by combining automatic and phenol-chloroform DNA extraction. DNA was incorporated into real-time PCRs targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Bacteria and the archaea Methanobrevibacter smithii and the chorismate synthase gene of S. enterica. Whereas negative controls consisting in DNA-free water remained negative, M. smithii was detected in 26/41 (63.4%) non-lyophilised (Ct value 28.78 \u00B1 9.1) versus 39/41 (95.1%) lyophilised aliquots (Ct value 22.04 \u00B1 5.5); bacterial 16S rRNA was detected in 33/41 (80.5%) non-lyophilised (Ct value 28.11 \u00B1 5.9) versus 40/41 (97.6%) lyophilised aliquots (Ct value 24.94 \u00B1 6.6); and S. enterica was detected in 6/6 (100%) non-lyophilized and lyophilized aliquots (Ct value 26.98 \u00B1 4.55 and 26.16 \u00B1 4.97, respectively). S. enterica was not detected in the 35 remaining diarrheal-stool specimens. The proportion of positive specimens was significantly higher after lyophilization for the detection of M. smithii (p = 0.00043) and Bacteria (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Lyophilization of diarrheic stool specimens significantly increases the PCR-based detection of microorganisms. The semi-automated protocol described here could be routinely used for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diarrhea.","publish_time":"2012-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donatin, Emilie; Drancourt, Michel","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db711fd7aaf7736b90115059f207349f679cba5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3538598.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-5-702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23273000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specimens positive","non-lyophilised aliquots","Ct value","Lyophilization of diarrheic stool specimens","human diarrheic stool specimens","remaining diarrheal-stool specimens","proportion of positive specimens","total DNA","lyophilized aliquots","semi-automated DNA extraction","Salmonella enterica","DNA-free water","phenol-chloroform DNA extraction","lyophilization of stools","S rRNA gene of Bacteria","PCR-based detection of microorganisms","semi-automated protocol","negative controls","detection of specific nucleic acid sequences","archaea Methanobrevibacter smithii","improved protocol","chorismate synthase gene","set-up","real-time PCRs","culture","CONCLUSION","molecular diagnosis of infectious diarrhea","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

There are no clinical presentations unique to LD and hence accurate laboratory tests are required for early diagnosis. Therefore, we designed a real-time PCR assay that targets the 23S-5S rRNA intergenic spacer region (23S-5S PCR) and allows for detection of all Legionella species and discrimination of L. pneumophila from other Legionella species. In total, 271 isolates representing 50 Legionella species were tested and the assay was validated using 39 culture-positive and 110 culture-negative patient specimens collected between 1989 and 2006. PCR-positive results were obtained with all 39 culture-positive samples (100% sensitivity). Specimens that tested positive according to 23S-5S PCR, but were culture-negative, were further analysed by DNA sequencing of the amplicon or the macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene. In addition to L. pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella cincinnatiensis and Legionella micdadei were identified in the specimens. The assay showed a 7-log dynamic range displaying a sensitivity of 7.5 CFU/mL or three genome equivalents per reaction. Sixty-one specimens containing viruses or bacteria other than Legionellae were negative according to 23S-5S PCR, demonstrating its specificity. Use of this assay should contribute to the earlier detection of respiratory disease caused by Legionella species, as well as to increased rates of detection.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, G.; Benson, R.; Pelish, T.; Brown, E.; Winchell, J.

Processing of the polyprotein, however, is not an all-or-nothing process in which endopeptidases act as simple peptide cutters. On the contrary, spatial-temporal modulation of these polyprotein cleavage events is crucial for a successful viral infection.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic virus which is widespread in swine herds. Information on optimal handling methods such as heat treatments, freezing and RNA stabilization agents is needed to prevent or minimize degradation of viral RNA by degradative enzymes. The objectives of the study were to determine optimum handling conditions of the oral fluid before RNA extraction and to compare the performance of the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit, which contains a stabilizing agent, with that of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, which does not contain a stabilizing agent. Preliminary studies with oral fluid inoculated with HEV indicated that a heat treatment of 60\u00B0C for 15min was detrimental to HEV RNA. HEV was recovered from 25/25 and 24/25 samples of oral fluid when samples were incubated for \u226424h at 4\u00B0C and 30days at \u221220\u00B0C, respectively, without a stabilizing agent and extracted with the QiaAMP kit. In contrast, HEV RNA was detected in 16/25 and 11/25 samples when samples were incubated with a stabilizing agent for 24h at 37\u00B0C and 30days at \u221220\u00B0C, respectively, and extracted with the RNeasy Protect Saliva kit. Moreover, the mean number of genome copies/ml of HEV recovered from oral fluid stored at \u221220\u00B0C without the stabilizing agent was 2.9 log units higher than oral fluid stored at \u221220\u00B0C in the presence of the stabilizing agent. The recovery of RNA from HEV, F-RNA coliphage MS2 and murine norovirus (MNV), which are surrogates for norovirus, was significantly greater when oral fluid was incubated for 24h at 4\u00B0C than when oral fluid was stabilized with RNAprotect Saliva Reagent for 24h at 37\u00B0C, where the relative differences between the two processes were 1.4, 1.8, and 2.7 log genome copies/ml for MS2, MNV, and HEV, respectively. The findings suggest that it is unnecessary to stabilize oral fluid from swine for the detection of viral RNA, provided the samples are stored at 4\u00B0C or frozen at \u221220\u00B0C, and that the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit did not perform well for the detection of viral RNA.","publish_time":"2014-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, T.

It is now also clear most if not all of these viruses also produce an abundant subgenomic long non-coding RNA. These non-coding RNAs, which are called subgenomicflavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) or Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs), are stable decay intermediates generated from the viral genomic RNA through the stalling of the cellular exoribonuclease Xrn1 at highly structured regions. Several functions of these flavivirus long non-coding RNAs have been revealed in recent years. The generation of these sfRNAs/xrRNAs from viral transcripts results in the repression of Xrn1 and the dysregulation of cellular mRNA stability. The abundant sfRNAs also serve directly as a decoy for important cellular protein regulators of the interferon and RNA interference antiviral pathways.

Several studies have investigated the use of plant extracts in the prevention and control of PRRS outbreaks. Thai medicinal plants may be useful for treating PRRSV infection in pigs. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro anti-PRRSV and antioxidant properties of seven Thai medicinal plants: Caesalpinia sappan Linn., Garcinia mangostana Linn., Houttuynia cordata, Perilla frutescens, Clinacanthus nutans, Phyllanthus emblica, and Tiliacora triandra. RESULTS: Using antiviral screening, we observed that T. triandra extract strongly inhibited PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells [virus titer 3.5 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml (log10)] at 24 h post-infection, whereas C. sappan extract strongly inhibited PRRSV replication [virus titer 2.5 TCID(50)/ml (log10)] at 72 h post-infection. C. sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content [220.52 mM gallic acid equivalent/g] and lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration [1.17 mg/ml in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2.58 mg/ml in 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt]. CONCLUSION: T. triandra extract could inhibit PRRSV infectivity, whereas C. sappan extract was the most effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. This study elucidates the antiviral activities of Thai medicinal plant extracts in vivo.

Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak. We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei. METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces. We used a susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave. FINDINGS: In all selected cities and provinces, the R(t) decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0\u00B798% (95% CI 0\u00B782\u20131\u00B716), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5\u00B791%, 5\u00B773\u20136\u00B709). Relaxing the interventions (resulting in R(t) \u003E1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level. INTERPRETATION: The first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of R(t) and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.

After turning over the influenza vaccination for elderly adults to the private sectors in 2015, the influenza vaccination coverage rate among this population increased to \u003E80%. In addition, after the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic crisis, the vaccine was domestically produced. By reaching a 75% vaccination coverage rate in the target groups, it was possible to put an end to the influenza pandemic and fix the shortcomings of the system that existed at that time. The influenza vaccination program, provided free of cost, was extended to include infants aged \u003C12 months in 2016 and \u226459 months in 2017 in order to reduce the influenza burden in these populations.

Understanding pathogen diversity and disease ecology is therefore critical for conserving these endangered animals. To determine viral diversity in free-ranging, non-habituated gorillas and chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo, genetic testing was performed on great-ape fecal samples collected near Odzala-Kokoua National Park. Samples were analyzed to determine ape species, identify individuals in the population, and to test for the presence of herpesviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses, bocaviruses, flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We identified 19 DNA viruses representing two viral families, Herpesviridae and Adenoviridae, of which three herpesviruses had not been previously described. Co-detections of multiple herpesviruses and/or adenoviruses were present in both gorillas and chimpanzees. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and lymphocryptovirus (LCV) were found primarily in the context of co-association with each other and adenoviruses. Using viral discovery curves for herpesviruses and adenoviruses, the total viral richness in the sample population of gorillas and chimpanzees was estimated to be a minimum of 23 viruses, corresponding to a detection rate of 83%. These findings represent the first description of DNA viral diversity in feces from free-ranging gorillas and chimpanzees in or near the Odzala-Kokoua National Park and form a basis for understanding the types of viruses circulating among great apes in this region.","publish_time":"2015-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seimon, Tracie A.; Olson, Sarah H.; Lee, Kerry Jo; Rosen, Gail; Ondzie, Alain; Cameron, Kenneth; Reed, Patricia; Anthony, Simon J.; Joly, Damien O.; McAloose, Denise; Lipkin, W.

In Brazil, where the diversity of mammals and especially rodents is considered one of the largest in the world, 9 hantavirus genotypes have been identified in 12 rodent species belonging to the genus Akodon, Calomys, Holochilus, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, Necromys and Rattus. Considering the increasing number of animals that have been implicated as reservoirs of different hantaviruses, the understanding of this diversity is important for evaluating the risk of distinct hantavirus species as human pathogens.","publish_time":"2014-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carvalho de Oliveira, Renata; Guterres, Alexandro; Fernandes, Jorlan; D\u2019Andrea, Paulo S\u00E9rgio; Bonvicino, Cibele Rodrigues; de Lemos, Elba Regina Sampaio","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/baf2944b65112b4b45b0c0f6aeb16e3e90a4f61e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4036540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784571/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v6051929","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["genus Hantavirus","Hantavirus genus","recognition of hantavirus","hantavirus genotypes","risk of distinct hantavirus species","diversity of wild animals","species of rodents","descovery of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome","human pathogens responsible","genus Akodon","rodent species","diversity of mammals","New World","variety of wild animals","reservoirs of different hantaviruses","increasing number of animals","agent responsible","order Chiroptera","order Soricomorpha","known reservoirs","Oligoryzomys","Holochilus","large spectrum of diseases","Oxymycterus","Eurasia","Calomys","shrews","haemorrhagic fever","understanding","Americas","Necromys","focus","moles","bats","result of expanded wildlife studies","Rattus","years","related viruses","Brazil"],"language":"en"},

To gain insight into the basis of this difference, we established a recombinant adenovirus system expressing the S protein from SL-CoV (rAd-Rp3-S) to investigate its immune characterization. Our results showed that immunized mice generated strong humoral immune responses against the SL-CoV S protein. Moreover, a strong cellular immune response demonstrated by elevated IFN-\u03B3 and IL-6 levels was also observed in these mice. However, the induced antibody from these mice had weaker cross-reaction with the SARS-CoV S protein, and did not neutralize HIV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein. These results demonstrated that the immunogenicity of the SL-CoV S protein is distinct from that of SARS-CoV, which may cause the immunological differences between human SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV. Furthermore, the recombinant virus could serve as a potential vaccine candidate against bat SL-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2010-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Yu-xuan; Peng, Cheng; Han, Zheng-gang; Zhou, Peng; Chen, Ji-guo; Shi, Zheng-li","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82c629c5878c63023651e3d44f00885525ecdae8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20960282/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-010-3096-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SL-CoV S protein","SARS-CoV S protein","human SARS-CoV","bat SL-CoV infection","SL-CoVs","S proteins","group of SARS","strong cellular immune response","immunized mice","immune characterization","results","strong humoral immune responses","immunological differences","fundamental differences","cellular receptor","recombinant virus","groups of coronaviruses","recombinant adenovirus system","identical genome structure","high-level sequence similarity","elevated IFN-\u03B3","potential vaccine candidate","weaker cross-reaction","N-terminus","rAd-Rp3","amino acid identity","immunogenicity","HIV","induced antibody","levels","insight","basis","horseshoe bats"],"language":"en"},

When expressed in CD4(\u002B) T lymphocytes, it can induce modifications in several essential cellular and biological networks. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the alterations caused by the viral protein, we have analyzed HCV-core subcellular localization and its associations with host proteins in Jurkat T cells. In order to investigate the intracellular localization of Hepatitis C virus core protein, we have used a lentiviral system to transduce Jurkat T cells and subsequently localize the protein using immunoelectron microscopy techniques. We found that in Jurkat T cells, Hepatitis C virus core protein mostly localizes in the nucleus and specifically in the nucleolus. In addition, we performed pull-down assays combined with Mass Spectrometry Analysis, to identify proteins that associate with Hepatitis C virus core in Jurkat T cells. We found proteins such as NOLC1, PP1\u03B3, ILF3, and C1QBP implicated in localization and/or traffic to the nucleolus. HCV-core associated proteins are implicated in RNA processing and RNA virus infection as well as in functions previously shown to be altered in Hepatitis C virus core expressing CD4(\u002B) T cells, such as cell cycle delay, decreased proliferation, and induction of a regulatory phenotype. Thus, in the current work, we show the ultrastructural localization of Hepatitis C virus core and the first profile of HCV core associated proteins in T cells, and we discuss the functions and interconnections of these proteins in molecular networks where relevant biological modifications have been described upon the expression of Hepatitis C virus core protein. Thereby, the current work constitutes a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms underlying HCV core mediated alterations that had been described in relevant biological processes in CD4(\u002B) T cells.","publish_time":"2018-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fern\u00E1ndez-Ponce, Cecilia; Dur\u00E1n-Ruiz, Maria C.; Narbona-S\u00E1nchez, Isaac; Mu\u00F1oz-Miranda, Juan P.; Arbulo-Echevarria, Mikel M.; Serna-Sanz, Antonio; Baumann, Christian; Litr\u00E1n, Roc\u00EDo; Aguado, Enrique; Bloch, Wilhelm; Garc\u00EDa-Cozar, Francisco","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7910acd7e2772df933ee8161c68baf67cc4991d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5758585.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354102/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Jurkat T","Mass Spectrometry Analysis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of Hepatitis C virus core protein","intracellular localization of Hepatitis C virus core protein","ultrastructural localization of Hepatitis C virus core","Jurkat T cells","HCV-core associated proteins","HCV-core subcellular localization","profile of HCV core associated proteins","HCV core mediated alterations","T lymphocytes","RNA virus infection","basic viral protein","host proteins","CD4","biological networks","relevant biological modifications","relevant biological processes","mechanisms","current work","viral capsid","functions","nucleolus","RNA processing","molecular networks","associations","cell cycle delay","decreased proliferation","induction","pull-down assays","Mass Spectrometry Analysis","necessary step","lentiviral system","ILF3","PP1\u03B3","interconnections","multimerizes","C1QBP","NOLC1","immunoelectron microscopy techniques","nucleus","regulatory phenotype","addition","light","order","traffic"],"language":"en"},

Based on single nucleotide polymorphism array data and whole genome sequencing (30\u00D7), we inferred that the last African admixture took place \u223C14 generations ago and estimated that up to 34% of the Canary Islander genome is of recent African descent. The length of regions in homozygosis and the ancestry-related mosaic organization of the Canary Islander genome support the view that isolation has been strongest on the two smallest islands. Furthermore, several genomic regions showed significant and large deviations in African or European ancestry and were significantly enriched in genes involved in prevalent diseases in this community, such as diabetes, asthma, and allergy. The most prominent of these regions were located near LCT and the HLA, two well-known targets of selection, at which 40\u201250% of the Canarian genome is of recent African descent according to our estimates. Putative selective signals were also identified in these regions near the SLC6A11-SLC6A1, KCNMB2, and PCDH20-PCDH9 genes. Taken together, our findings provide solid evidence of a significant recent African admixture, population isolation, and adaptation in this part of Europe, with the favoring of African alleles in some chromosome regions. These findings may have medical implications for populations of recent African ancestry.","publish_time":"2018-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guillen-Guio, Beatriz; Lorenzo-Salazar, Jose M; Gonz\u00E1lez-Montelongo, Rafaela; D\u00EDaz-de Usera, Ana; Marcelino-Rodr\u00EDguez, Itahisa; Corrales, Almudena; Cabrera de Le\u00F3n, Antonio; Alonso, Santos; Flores, Carlos","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33813052430b7faada17882d12fc343aad02981e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6278859.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30289472/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msy190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North Africa","Europe","Canary Islander"],"keyphrases":["recent African descent","significant recent African admixture","populations of recent African ancestry","Canary Islander genome","favoring of African alleles","genomic regions","chromosome regions","length of regions","genome sequencing","European ancestry","Canarian genome","geographical isolation","population isolation","findings","genetic resemblance of Canary Islanders","southern European populations","historical admixture of aborigines","ancestry-related mosaic organization","distinctive genetic makeup","PCDH20-PCDH9 genes","large deviations","Europeans","North Africa","disease susceptibility","single nucleotide polymorphism array data","medical implications","solid evidence","KCNMB2","homozygosis","view","sub-Saharan Africans","community","HLA","adaptation","SLC6A11-SLC6A1","well-known targets of selection","diabetes","asthma","health disparities","prevalent diseases","LCT","place","generations","estimates","Putative selective signals","allergy","smallest islands"],"language":"en"},

No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19. Method In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. Result The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was \u22121.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6\u201324.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2\u221243.0. Conclusion The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhifeng, Jiang; Feng, Aiqiao; Li, Tao","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a4e84d75e53895733b5cceed2b8b23f137558e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151409.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302956/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Xiaogan Central Hospital","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["changes of CT","nucleic acid test positive","sensitivity of nucleic acid positive","positive of nucleic acid tests","initial positive nucleic acid test","initial nucleic acid testing","initial nucleic acid detection","early nucleic acid tests","Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes","early lung CT changes","sensitivity of lung CT","characteristic CT changes of lung","specificity of CT","patients","positive test results","initial diagnosis","latest COVID","gold standard","low sensitivity","Abstract Background COVID","unified diagnostic standard","consistency","diagnostic criteria","latest outbreak of infectious disease","huge medical challenges","infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital","China","lungs","relationships","entire globe","Method","accordance","Conclusion","failure","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

Discussion COVID-19 has infected over 3.5 million people and killed over 240,000 people worldwide. While pulmonary complications are profound, the neurologic system is also significantly impacted, with complications including acute cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Additionally, patients on immunosuppressive medications for pre-existing neurologic issues are at an increased risk for complications with COVID-19 infection, and many of the currently proposed COVID-19 therapies can interact with these medications.

However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate instant case fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in China. Methods We collected 82735 confirmed cases released officially by Chinese authorities from Dec 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Afterward, instant fatality rate was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date. Results In China, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.8-14.6% from Jan 1 to Jan 17, and then gradually declined and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average case fatality rate in China was 6.1%\u00B12.9%. While, the case fatality rate was 1.0\u00B10.4% in China except Hubei. The cure rates of COVID-19 were 93.9%\u00B12.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0%\u00B10.4% in China except Hubei. Conclusion The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China was much higher than that in China except Hubei.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) recommends that FMDV vaccines are composed of inactivated virus that has been purified to remove non-structural viral proteins. Such purified vaccines primarily induce antibodies to viral structural proteins, whereas replicating virus stimulates host antibodies specific for both structural and non-structural proteins. The current preferred FMDV DIVA test is a competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) designed to detect antibodies to the non-structural protein 3ABC. Previously, we described the development of an FMDV DIVA test based entirely on recombinant proteins (the recombinant detecting antibody and the 3ABC coating antigen) produced in Escherichia coli. In this study, we have determined the precise binding site of the recombinant detecting antibody to a conserved sequence within the 3B region of the 3ABC protein, replaced the original E-tag of the detecting antibody with two in-house tags and engineered a direct antibody\u2013reporting enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) fusion protein. These modifications have further improved the DIVA test, providing great potential for large scale production and uptake due to its simplicity, reproducibility and low cost.","publish_time":"2010-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Janine D.; Wilkins, Michelle; Foord, Adam J.; Dolezal, Olan; Yu, Meng; Heine, Hans G.; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a85d0ba34058935c75d091c18bf04765a08c209d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094511.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175909003408; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175909003408; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2009.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19913020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant proteins","detecting antibody","non-structural proteins","FMDV vaccines","ABC protein","non-structural viral proteins","viral structural proteins","current preferred FMDV DIVA test","direct antibody","host antibodies specific","replicating virus","mouth disease virus","inactivated virus","fusion protein","purified vaccines","ABC coating antigen","competitive ELISA","C-ELISA","great potential","uptake","OIE","enzyme","large scale production","alkaline phosphatase","simplicity","B region","conserved sequence","original E-tag","in-house tags","resumption of trade","Animal Health","reproducibility","World Organisation","outbreak","Abstract Differentiating foot","vaccination","precise binding site","freedom","Escherichia coli","natural infection","low cost","livestock products","development","modifications","study"],"language":"en"},

Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China. METHODS: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices. RESULTS: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies.

We have performed molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and principle component analysis (PCA) to investigate the role of the catalytic triad and conformational dynamics of type I and type II of nsp4 PRRSV. The results showed that the RMSF of residues 136\u2013142 near the active site of all models was highly flexible. Moreover, we identified the effect of single structural mutations of the catalytic triad. The percentage of residue with a 0.1nm RMSF value and PCA results revealed that the mutations affected domain I and II suggesting the wild types were more stable than the mutants. At the catalytic triad, the distances between H39 and S118 were very flexible while the distances between H39 and D64 were very stable. H39, D64 and S118 showed high occupancy percentage of the hydrogen bond interaction with many residues that are conserved in PRRSVAS, PRRSVES, LDVC, LDVP and EAV. Moreover, S118 of wild-type protein formed H-bonds with T134 and G135 but these interactions were lost in PRRSVAV (S118A) and PRRSVES (S117A) indicating that the substitution of important H-bond interaction in PRRSVAS (S118A) and PRRSVES (S117A) affected the flexibility around the catalytic triad, conformation and proteolytic activity. Overall, our study may provide the structural basic of the catalytic triad and be useful for testing the protein activity in future experiments.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aeksiri, Niran; Jantafong, Tippawan","journal":"Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/405a2c2f0fd4e5b8bf8692a9728df332f9b89625.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110526.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2017.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411461/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326317300633; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326317300633","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCA","EAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catalytic triad","H39","PRRSVES","type protein","S118 of wild","conformational dynamics of type","PRRSVAS","protein activity","S118A","PCA results","D64","distances","RMSF of residues","S117A","hydrogen bond interaction","substitution of important H-bond interaction","H-bonds","percentage of residue","effect of single structural mutations","nsp4 PRRSV","proteolytic activity","wild types","high occupancy percentage","nm RMSF value","molecular dynamics simulations","respiratory virus","MD","major economic concerns","principle component analysis","T134","flexibility","swine industry","interactions","G135","LDVC","LDVP","role","models","active site","EAV","future experiments","PRRSVAV","domain","mutants","study"],"language":"en"},

We found that NAP9 binds to endogenous EMMPRIN in cultured HL1 myocytes and in mouse hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (IR).

In the same way, cardiac parameters were recovered to almost healthy levels (LVEF NAP9 63% \u00B1 7.24 vs Control 42% \u00B1 4.74 or NAPSC 39% \u00B1 6.44), whereas ECM degradation was also reduced as shown by inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans have shown a signal enhancement in the left ventricle of NAP9 injected mice with respect to non-injected, and to mice injected with NAPSC. A positive correlation between CMR enhancement and Evans-Blue/TTC staining of infarct size was calculated (R:0.65). Taken together, these results point to EMMPRIN targeted nanoparticles as a new approach to the mitigation of ischemic/reperfusion injury.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuadrado, Irene; Piedras, Maria Jose Garcia Miguel; Herruzo, Irene; Turpin, Maria del Carmen; Castej\u00F3n, Borja; Reventun, Paula; Martin, Ana; Saura, Marta; Zamorano, Jose Luis; Zaragoza, Carlos","journal":"Theranostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/570862c4784b6f780726ec0548fc402a413146b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4775864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26941847/; https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.13352","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAPSC","ECM","CMR","Evans-Blue/TTC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NAPSC","LVEF NAP9","Injection of NAP9","endogenous EMMPRIN","EMMPRIN targeted nanoparticles","vs Control","inhibition of MMP","left ventricle of NAP9","EMMPRIN binding peptide AP","negative control","gelatinases MMP","Inhibition of extracellular matrix","CMR enhancement","cardiac parameters","matrix metalloproteinases","cardiac protection","ischemia","ECM degradation","IR","activation","Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer","Cardiac magnetic resonance","signal enhancement","TTC staining of infarct size","scrambled peptide","reperfusion injury","fluorescent micellar nanoparticles","acute myocardial infarction","progression of myocardial cell death","Evans-Blue","cultured HL1 myocytes","mouse hearts","scans","new approach","mitigation of ischemic","AMI","response","MMPs","mechanism","respect","healthy levels","positive correlation","time","results","day","way"],"language":"en"},

Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) have a particularly high risk of acquiring certain infections during travel. Chinese VFR travellers account for a substantial proportion of all travel in Western countries with high migrant populations. Methods A literature review was undertaken regarding major infectious disease risks for VFR travellers visiting China. This included an examination of the previous pandemics arising in China, the likelihood of future outbreaks in China from H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses, the potential role of travellers in disease transmission, and the special risks for VFR travellers. Results China has been the origin of several influenza pandemics in past few decades, and the origin of several emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential, including SARS. Travel to and from China has the potential for global spread of emergent infectious diseases, as seen in the SARS outbreak in 2003. For VFR travellers, the risk of other infectious diseases may also be greater in China compared to their countries of migration, including hepatitis A and B, dengue fever, typhoid, and other diseases. Conclusions VFR travel to China may be associated with increased risk of acquiring a range of infectious diseases, and also poses a potential risk for importation of future pandemics to other countries. Chinese VFR travellers need to be cognisant of these risks and health professionals should consider educational interventions to minimise these risks.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C.

Treatment recommendations must consider this risk for elderly and vulnerable cancer patients. We re-analyzed trials in elderly glioblastoma (GBM) patients, incorporating COVID-19 risk, in order to provide a quantitative framework for comparing different radiation (RT) fractionation schedules on patient outcomes. METHODS: We extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) for 1,321 patients from Kaplan-Meier curves from five randomized trials on treatment of elderly GBM patients including available subanalyses based on MGMT methylation status. We simulated trial data with incorporation of COVID-19 associated mortality risk in several scenarios (low, medium, and high infection and mortality risks). Median overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated for each simulation replicate. RESULTS: Our simulations reveal how COVID-19-associated risks affect survival under different treatment regimens. Hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrated the best outcomes in low and medium risk scenarios. In frail elderly patients, shorter courses of RT are preferable. In patients with methylated MGMT receiving single modality treatment, TMZ-alone treatment approaches may be an option in settings with high COVID-19-associated risk. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of COVID-19-associated risk models into analysis of randomized trials can help guide clinical decisions during this pandemic. In elderly GBM patients, our results support prioritization of hypofractionated RT and highlight the utility of MGMT methylation status in decision-making in pandemic scenarios. Our quantitative framework can serve as a model for assessing COVID-19 risk associated with treatment across neuro-oncology.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tabrizi, Shervin; Trippa, Lorenzo; Cagney, Daniel; Tanguturi, Shyam; Ventz, Steffen; Fell, Geoffrey; Wen, Patrick Y; Alexander, Brian M; Rahman, Rifaquat","journal":"Neuro Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32101f348566b51e572010df1708537a62ca6a2e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339235/; https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noaa111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated mortality risk","treatment of elderly GBM patients","risk of infection","associated risk models","cancer treatment","high COVID","incorporation of COVID","frail elderly patients","medium risk scenarios","treatment approaches","Treatment recommendations","ongoing COVID","associated risks","different treatment regimens","vulnerable cancer patients","elderly glioblastoma","single modality treatment","pandemic scenarios","mortality risks","analysis of randomized trials","shorter courses of RT","TMZ","methylated MGMT","utility of MGMT methylation status","results support prioritization of hypofractionated RT","high infection","patient outcomes","quantitative framework","re-analyzed trials","different radiation","best outcomes","individual patient-level data","trial data","Median overall survival","available subanalyses","IPLD","fractionation schedules","decision-making","hazard ratios","adjuvant temozolomide","Kaplan-Meier curves","option","healthcare system","settings","clinical decisions","order","simulation replicate","neuro-oncology","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","simulations"],"language":"en"},

Here, we identified an anti-asthmatic drug, montelukast, which is of safety profile for pregnant women and exhibited antiviral efficacy against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo.

In consideration of the neuro-protective activity that montelukast possessed, which was previously reported, it is promising that montelukast could be used for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly for pregnant women.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yongkang; Li, Yuan; Wang, Xiaohuan; Zou, Peng","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/625afb5a588fd265e15b652a437ef9f521682aee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7002393.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32082265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatments of ZIKV infection","pregnant women","higher safety profile","therapeutic drugs","viral infectivity","viral genomic RNA","severe complications","fetal microcephaly","neurological sequelae","antiviral efficacy","global attentions","virions","association of Zika virus","consideration","neuro-protective activity","anti-asthmatic drug","outbreak","vaccines","patients","integrity"],"language":"en"},

The disease, as well as the causative Alphacoronavirus, the Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), was first described in Europe in the 1970s and since then has spread over many Asian and American countries, where it recently led to devastating effects on swine health and pork industry. While the disease was seldom reported in Europe within the last few decades, a few recent reports re-emergence of PED in German pig farms. The hitherto isolated German strain seems to be closely related to a low pathogenic PEDV variant from the USA. This case report describes the first detection of PEDV in Austria. CASE PRESENTATION: Reduced feed uptake and occasional diarrhea were observed in December 2014 in a group of fattening pigs, kept on an Austrian swine farm. The concerned pigs had been recently purchased from Germany. Within a few weeks, diarrhea became apparent also in pigs of Austrian origin, which were kept in a different stable on the same farm. Gastrointestinal symptoms among fattening pigs were generally mild, quickly resolving and did not lead to death. PEDV RNA was identified by RT-qPCR in pooled feces and serum and PEDV antibodies were detectable in serum in both groups of pigs. Phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete PEDV spike gene shows that the Austrian PEDV strain is highly similar to other strains involved in recent outbreaks in Western and Central Europe. CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating the presence of PEDV in Austria. The virus was probably introduced by purchasing piglets from a German source, which underlines the significance of trans-boundary animal trade for the distribution of highly contagious diseases, such as PED.

We previously developed the DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 encoding chicken type II collagen (CCII) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study, we characterized its dynamic profile, biodistribution, and potential for genomic DNA integration in normal vaccinated rodent. RESULTS: A real-time quantitative PCR analysis (RT-qPCR) of animals administered a single dose of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 (300 \u03BCg/kg by intramuscular injection) showed that CCOL2A1 mRNA level in the blood peaked between 2 and 6 h post-immunization and then rapidly declined, and was undetectable between day 1\u201342. CCOL2A1 transcript was detected at the muscle injection site on days 3\u201314 post-immunization. Starting from day 14, the transcript was detected in the heart, liver, lung, and kidney but not in the spleen or thymus, and was expressed only in the lung on day 28. There was no CCOL2A1 mRNA present in the testes or ovaries at any time point. Non-invasive in vivo fluorescence imaging revealed CCII protein expression from 2 h up to day 10 and from 2 h up to day 35 after administration of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 via the intravenous and intramuscular routes, respectively; the protein had disappeared by day 42. Importantly, CCOL2A1 was not integrated into the host genome. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that pcDNA-CCOL2A1 vaccine is rapidly cleared within a short period of time and is therefore safe, and merits further development as a therapeutic vaccine for RA treatment.","publish_time":"2019-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiao; Long, Juan; Liang, Fei; Liu, Nan; Sun, Yuying; Xi, Yongzhi","journal":"J Nanobiotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc64088b806d6f43c4888ddb00a0479c8e57d33e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6729025.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492169/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-019-0528-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pcDNA-CCOL2A1 vaccine","CCOL2A1 transcript","DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1","CCOL2A1 mRNA present","CCOL2A1 mRNA level","therapeutic vaccine","new therapeutic DNA vaccine","administration of pcDNA","h post-immunization","genomic DNA integration","biodistribution","single dose of pcDNA","intramuscular injection","RESULTS","host genome","RA treatment","lung","CCII protein expression","risk of integration","intramuscular routes","time point","present study","muscle injection site","treatment of rheumatoid arthritis","short period of time","potential","chicken type","RT-qPCR","testes","real-time quantitative PCR analysis","normal vaccinated rodent","animals","fluorescence imaging","days","ovaries","development","collagen","dynamic profile","merits","blood","\u03BCg","kidney","liver","persistence","heart","preclinical studies","spleen","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","thymus"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Rapid diagnostic techniques are valuable tools in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infections, especially for the detection of some microorganisms and in certain groups of patients. While antigen detection techniques are widely used in Clinical Microbiology laboratories, for the diagnosis of viruses, some parasites and some bacteria, molecular techniques are routinely used only for some pathogens (such as Clostridium difficile). However, molecular techniques are constantly evolving, and they allow a rapid diagnosis for an increasing number of pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, they are also able to detect virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. Syndromic surveillance systems, which detect different pathogens simultaneously, are very promising because they enable the most frequent pathogens to be diagnosed in a few hours and they can be very useful in certain patients. For the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, molecular techniques are able to detect bacteria and its resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, allowing the most appropriate treatment to be selected for each patient when bacterial culture is not possible.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balsalobre-Arenas, Luz; Alarc\u00F3n-Cavero, Teresa","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/118ba92ce2640b2fb2bd7f5184a3251b5fd6a55e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103346.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X17300228; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X17300228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","Syndromic surveillance systems, which detect different pathogens simultaneously"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["and some bacteria","t\u00E9cnicas de diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido","t\u00E9cnicas de detecci\u00F3n","For the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection","especially for the detection of some microorganisms and in certain groups of patients","In addition","diagn\u00F3stico de virus","determinados pat\u00F3genos","t\u00E9cnicas moleculares","detect bacteria and its resistance","and they allow a rapid diagnosis for an increasing number of pathogens","valuable tools in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infections","clarithromycin and levofloxacin","they enable the most frequent pathogens","routinely used only for some pathogens","be diagnosed in a few hours and they can be very useful in certain patients","sistemas de diagn\u00F3stico sindr\u00F3mico","determinados pacientes","allowing the most appropriate treatment","with high sensitivity and specificity","widely used in Clinical Microbiology","be selected for each patient when bacterial","which detect different pathogens simultaneously","detecci\u00F3n de factores","determinados grupos de pacientes","very promising","also able","detect virulence factors or resistance mechanisms","such as Clostridium difficile","gran valor","gran utilidad","mecanismos de resistencia","resistencia a claritromicina","While antigen detection","Abstract Rapid diagnostic","constantly evolving","pr\u00E1ctica habitual","Syndromic surveillance systems","herramientas","laboratorios de microbiolog\u00EDa cl\u00EDnica","ant\u00EDgeno","constante evoluci\u00F3n","manera rutinaria","infecci\u00F3n","not possible","cultivo","elevada sensibilidad","virulencia","bacterias","especificidad","microorganismos","par\u00E1sitos","n\u00FAmero","infecciones gastrointestinales","tratamiento","levofloxacino","However","forma simult\u00E1nea","horas","embargo"],"language":"es"},

Our healthcare systems are very vulnerable to viruses with a particular tropism for hospital personnel. International collaboration by teams of epidemiologists as well as virologists was the key to success against SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). We were lucky in the fight against SARS, the virus was in fact moderately transmissible and then only after the onset of symptoms. It was thus possible to isolate cases before they became contagious. SARS provided a good \u201Cdress rehearsal\u201D and educated the public authorities about the issues of infectious pandemics.

Pan, X. Tian, P. Qin, B. Wang, et al., Vet Microbiol 211:15\u201321, 2017). SeACoV was later referred to as swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) by another group (P. Zhou, H. Fan, T. Lan, X.-L. Yang, et al., Nature 556:255\u2013258, 2018). The present study was set up to investigate the potential species barriers of SADS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that SADS-CoV possesses a broad species tropism and is able to infect cell lines from diverse species, including bats, mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters, pigs, chickens, nonhuman primates, and humans. Trypsin contributes to but is not essential for SADS-CoV propagation in vitro. Furthermore, C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with the virus via oral or intraperitoneal routes. Although the mice exhibited only subclinical infection, they supported viral replication and prolonged infection in the spleen. SADS-CoV nonstructural proteins and double-stranded RNA were detected in splenocytes of the marginal zone on the edge of lymphatic follicles, indicating active replication of SADS-CoV in the mouse model. We identified that splenic dendritic cells (DCs) are the major targets of virus infection by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry approaches. Finally, we demonstrated that SADS-CoV does not utilize known CoV receptors for cellular entry. The ability of SADS-CoV to replicate in various cells lines from a broad range of species and the unexpected tropism for murine DCs provide important insights into the biology of this bat-origin CoV, highlighting its possible ability to cross interspecies barriers. IMPORTANCE Infections with bat-origin coronaviruses (CoVs) (severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV [SARS-CoV] and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV [MERS-CoV]) have caused severe illness in humans after \u201Chost jump\u201D events. Recently, a novel bat-HKU2-like CoV named swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) has emerged in southern China, causing lethal diarrhea in newborn piglets. It is important to assess the species barriers of SADS-CoV infection since the animal hosts (other than pigs and bats) and zoonotic potential are still unknown. An in vitro susceptibility study revealed a broad species tropism of SADS-CoV, including various rodent and human cell lines. We established a mouse model of SADS-CoV infection, identifying its active replication in splenic dendritic cells, which suggests that SADS-CoV has the potential to infect rodents. These findings highlight the potential cross-species transmissibility of SADS-CoV, although further surveillance in other animal populations is needed to fully understand the ecology of this bat-HKU2-origin CoV.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yong-Le; Qin, Pan; Wang, Bin; Liu, Yan; Xu, Guo-Han; Peng, Lei; Zhou, Jiyong; Zhu, Shu Jeffrey; Huang, Yao-Wei","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/284053d25cd426f6121c3fed5ea6a017717853ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6880172.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01448-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P.

Viral clearance and resolution of infection requires a complex, multi-faceted response initiated by resident respiratory tract cells and innate immune cells and ultimately resolved by adaptive immune cells. Although an effective immune response to eliminate viral pathogens is essential, a prolonged or exaggerated response can damage the respiratory tract. Immune-mediated pulmonary damage is manifested clinically in a variety of ways depending on location and extent of injury. Thus, the antiviral immune response represents a balancing act between the elimination of virus and immune-mediated pulmonary injury. In this review, we highlight major components of the host response to acute viral infection and their role in contributing to mitigating respiratory damage. We also briefly describe common clinical manifestations of respiratory viral infection and morphological correlates. The continuing threat posed by pandemic influenza as well as the emergence of novel respiratory viruses also capable of producing severe acute lung injury such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and enterovirus D68, highlights the need for an understanding of the immune mechanisms that contribute to virus elimination and immune-mediated injury.","publish_time":"2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Newton, Amy H.; Cardani, Amber; Braciale, Thomas J.","journal":"Semin Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f39671c6a9f5a19d6db58094f4a8f07f6e036085.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4896975.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26965109/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-016-0558-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune-mediated injury","antiviral immune response","effective immune response","immune mechanisms","respiratory damage","innate immune cells","adaptive immune cells","resident respiratory tract cells","acute viral infection","host response","exaggerated response","viral pathogens","pulmonary injury","common clinical manifestations of respiratory viral infection","Viral clearance","extent of injury","pulmonary damage","multi-faceted response","emergence of novel respiratory viruses","resolution of infection","elimination of virus","virus elimination","severe acute lung injury","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","balancing act","complex","role","major components","morphological correlates","pandemic influenza","enterovirus D68","location","need","continuing threat","variety of ways","understanding","review","external environment"],"language":"en"},

Double helices with consecutive Watson-Crick base-pairing may also be formed between distant RNA segments thereby facilitating long-range interactions of long-chain RNA that may be biologically functional. Here we addressed the potential formation of RNA duplex motifs by long-range RNA-RNA interactions of distantly located matching sequence elements of a single long-chain RNA. RESULTS: We generated a Python-based software tool that identifies consecutive RNA duplex elements at any given length and nucleotide content formed by distant sequences. The software tool, dubbed RNAslider, is built on the theoretical RNA structure prediction algorithm Mfold. Source code and sample data sets are available on demand. We found that a small ratio of human genes including the Argonaute (Ago)-like gene family encode mRNAs containing highly GC-rich non-hairpin duplex elements (GC-helix) of equal to or more than 8 base pairs in length and we provide experimental evidence for their biological significance. CONCLUSION: GC-helices are observed preferentially within the 5(\u2032)-region of mRNAs in an evolutionarily conserved fashion indicating their potential biological role.

Methods In all, 3104 adults with LRTI were enrolled, of whom 141 (4.5%) had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 2985 matched controls in a prospective study in 16 primary care networks in Europe, and followed patients up at 28\u201335 days. We detected Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and assessed susceptibility, atypical bacteria and viruses. Results A potential pathogen was detected in 1844 (59%) (in 350 (11%) bacterial pathogens only, in 1190 (38%) viral pathogens only, and in 304 (10%) both bacterial and viral pathogens). The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were S. pneumoniae (5.5% overall, 9.2% in CAP patients) and H. influenzae (5.4% overall, 14.2% in CAP patients). Less than 1% of S. pneumoniae were highly resistant to penicillin and 12.6% of H. influenzae were \u03B2-lactamase positive. The most common viral pathogens detected were human rhinovirus (20.1%), influenza viruses (9.9%), and human coronavirus (7.4%). Influenza virus, human parainfluenza viruses and human respiratory syncytial virus as well as human rhinovirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus were detected significantly more frequently in LRTI patients than in controls. Conclusions A bacterial pathogen is identified in approximately one in five adult patients with LRTI in primary care, and a viral pathogen in just under half, with mixed infections in one in ten. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci and \u03B2-lactamase-producing H. influenzae are uncommon.

SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19) has produced an unprecedented global pandemic. Though the death rate from COVID-19 infection is ~2%, many infected people recover at home. Among patients for whom COVID-19 is deadly are those with pre-existing co-morbidities. Therefore, identification of populations at highest risk of COVID-19 mortality could significantly improve the capacity of healthcare providers to take early action and minimize the possibility of overwhelming care centers, which in turn would save many lives. Although several approaches have been used/developed (or are being developed/suggested) to diagnose COVID-19 infection, no approach is available/proposed for fast diagnosis of COVID-19 infections likely to be fatal. The central aim of this short perspective is to suggest a few possible nano-based technologies (i.e., protein corona sensor array and magnetic levitation) that could discriminate COVID19-infected people while still in the early stages of infection who are at high risk of death. Such discrimination technologies would not only be useful in protecting health care centers from becoming overwhelmed, but would also provide a powerful tool to better control possible future pandemics with less social and economic burden.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahmoudi, Morteza","journal":"Molecular pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.0c00371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["highest risk of COVID","fast diagnosis of COVID","early stages of infection","health care centers","high risk of death","COVID19-infected people","possible nano-based technologies","early action","possibility of overwhelming care centers","discrimination technologies","death rate","better control possible future pandemics","protein corona sensor array","magnetic levitation","powerful tool","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","short perspective","infections likely","capacity of healthcare providers","turn","SARS-CoV","mortality","economic burden","identification of populations","pre-existing co-morbidities","central aim","unprecedented global pandemic","home","lives","patients","approaches"],"language":"en"},

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.

Previous literature suggests that the TGEV nucleocapsid protein (N) plays a significant role in viral transcriptional process, however, there is a need to examine other functions of TGEV N protein in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) which is the target cell of TGEV. In the present study, we investigated the degradation, subcellular localisation, and function of TGEV N protein by examining its effects on cycle progression, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, and cell survival. The results showed that TGEV N protein localised in the cytoplasm, inhibited IEC growth, prolonged the S-phase cell cycle by down-regulating cell cycle protein cyclin A, and was mainly degraded through the proteasome pathway. Moreover, TGEV N protein induced ER stress and activated NF-\u03BAB, which was responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. This report mainly considers the functions of TGEV N protein in IEC. To be specific, in IEC, TGEV N protein induces cell cycle prolongation at the S-phase, ER stress and up-regulates IL-8 expression. These results provide a better understanding of the functions and structural mechanisms of TGEV N protein.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qi; Xu, Ying; Chang, Rong; Tong, Dewen; Xu, Xingang","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8397db5938687c5e7758d30c3fb75aba0237f3cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111826.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528817309207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29909129/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528817309207; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.06.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","TGEV N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functions of TGEV N protein","function of TGEV N protein","TGEV nucleocapsid protein","structural mechanisms of TGEV N protein","TGEV N protein induced ER stress","target cell of TGEV","cell cycle protein cyclin","cell cycle prolongation","S-phase cell cycle","cell survival","expression","cycle progression","porcine intestinal epithelial cell","inhibited IEC growth","regulation of IL","results","enteropathogenic virus","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","effects","endoplasmic reticulum","activated NF-\u03BAB","cytoplasm","acute diseases","significant role","degradation","better understanding","subcellular localisation","viral transcriptional process","suckling piglets","interleukin","Previous literature","essay","Bcl","present study","need","report","proteasome pathway"],"language":"en"},

The ongoing threat to global public health and the need for novel therapeutic countermeasures have driven the development of animal models that can reproducibly replicate the pathology associated with MERS-CoV in human infections. The inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice, hamsters, and ferrets stymied initial attempts to generate small animal models. Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (hDPP4) as the receptor for MERS-CoV infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice. Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles, and limited MERS-CoV susceptibility to tissues that naturally express mDPP4, notably the lower respiratory tract wherein MERS-CoV elicits severe pulmonary pathology. Here, we describe the generation of the 288\u2013330(\u002B/\u002B) MERS-CoV mouse model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by modifying two amino acids on mDPP4 (A288 and T330), and the use of adaptive evolution to generate novel MERS-CoV isolates that cause fatal respiratory disease. The 288\u2013330(\u002B/\u002B) mice are currently being used to evaluate novel drug, antibody, and vaccine therapeutic countermeasures for MERS-CoV. The chapter starts with a historical perspective on the emergence of MERS-CoV and animal models evaluated for MERS-CoV pathogenesis, and then outlines the development of the 288\u2013330(\u002B/\u002B) mouse model, assays for assessing a MERS-CoV pulmonary infection in a mouse model, and describes some of the challenges associated with using genetically engineered mice.","publish_time":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leist, Sarah R.; Cockrell, Adam S.","journal":"MERS Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5ff9ac9932f0516ee14014736c5c17827aca223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123801.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31883094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV pathogenesis","MERS-CoV mouse model","novel MERS-CoV isolates","MERS-CoV pulmonary infection","limited MERS-CoV susceptibility","emergence of MERS","inability of MERS","respiratory tracts of mice","fatal respiratory disease","severe respiratory disease","engineered mice","development of animal models","genetic engineering of mice","lower respiratory tract","novel therapeutic countermeasures","small animal models","express mDPP4","novel drug","severe pulmonary pathology","Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4","vaccine therapeutic countermeasures","monthly cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","human infections","Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV","CRISPR","Cas9 technology","inherent expression profiles","interspaced short palindromic repeats","global public health","initial attempts","need","hDPP4","hamsters","door","ferrets","antibody","amino acids","receptor","use of adaptive evolution","ongoing threat","T330","A288","historical perspective","assays","chapter","challenges","diagnosed individuals","generation"],"language":"en"},

The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 tested the capacities of countries to detect, assess, notify and report events as required by the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR). As detailed in the IHR, the World Health Organization drew on official reports from Member States as well as unofficial sources (e.g. media alerts) to quickly report and disseminate information about the appearance of the novel influenza virus. The pre-existing Global Influenza Surveillance Network for virological surveillance also provided crucial information for rapid development of a vaccine and for detection of changes in the virus. However, the pandemic also highlighted a number of shortcomings in global epidemiological surveillance for respiratory disease. These included the lack of standards for reporting illness, risk factor and mortality data, and a mechanism for systematic reporting of epidemiological data. Such measures would have facilitated direct comparison of data between countries and improved timely understanding of the characteristics and impact of the pandemic.

The HAV 3C cysteine protease (3Cpro), an important nonstructural protein, is responsible for most cleavage within the viral polyprotein and is critical for the processes of viral replication. Our group has previously demonstrated that HAV 3Cpro cleaves human NF-\u03BAB essential modulator (NEMO), a kinase required in interferon signaling. Based on this finding, we generated four luciferase-based biosensors containing the NEMO sequence (PVLKAQ\u2193ADIYKA) that is cleaved by HAV 3Cpro and/or the Nostoc punctiforme DnaE intein, to monitor the activity of HAV 3Cpro in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). Western blotting showed that HAV 3Cpro recognized and cleaved the NEMO cleavage sequence incorporated in the four biosensors, whereas only one cyclized luciferase-based biosensor (233-DnaE-HAV, 233DH) showed a measurable and reliable increase in firefly luciferase activity, with very low background, in the presence of HAV 3Cpro. With this biosensor (233DH), we monitored HAV 3Cpro activity in HEK-293T cells, and tested it against a catalytically deficient mutant HAV 3Cpro and other virus-encoded proteases. The results showed that the activity of this luciferase biosensor is specifically dependent on HAV 3Cpro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the luciferase biosensor developed here might provide a rapid, sensitive, and efficient evaluation of HAV 3Cpro activity, and should extend our better understanding of the biological relevance of HAV 3Cpro.","publish_time":"2017-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Junwei; Wang, Dang; Xi, Yongqiang; Zhu, Xinyu; Yang, Yuting; Lv, Mengting; Luo, Chuanzhen; Chen, Jiyao; Ye, Xu; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a27468b9db8aa0e958968db14050a550f4fb27a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092888.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X17309257; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X17309257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28501618/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.05.063","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV 3C","HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of HAV","Cpro activity","DnaE-HAV","presence of HAV","efficient evaluation of HAV","biological relevance of HAV","deficient mutant HAV","luciferase biosensor","firefly luciferase activity","luciferase-based biosensors","cyclized luciferase-based biosensor","NEMO sequence","NEMO cleavage sequence","HEK","T cells","DH","human embryonic kidney cells","viral polyprotein","Abstract Hepatitis","virus-encoded proteases","processes of viral replication","Nostoc punctiforme DnaE intein","human NF-\u03BAB essential modulator","reliable increase","acute infection","low background","important nonstructural protein","better understanding","PVLKAQ","ADIYKA","C cysteine protease","kinase","Western blotting","data","interferon","finding","results","group","world"],"language":"en"},

Pulmonary cGVHD can present with obstructive and/or restrictive changes. Disease severity ranges from subclinical pulmonary function test (PFT) impairment to respiratory insufficiency with bronchiolitis obliterans being the only pulmonary complication currently considered diagnostic of cGVHD. Early diagnosis may improve clinical outcome, and regular post-transplant follow-up PFTs are recommended. Diagnostic work-up includes high-resolution computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage and histology. Topical treatment is based on inhalative steroids plus beta-agonists. Early addition of azithromycin is suggested. Systemic first-line treatment consists of corticosteroids plus, if any, continuation of other immunosuppressive therapy.

The assay performance was assessed using standard curves from synthesized DNA. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was evaluated by spiking solutions extracted from nasal swabs that were negative by Dembo respiratory-PCR for nucleic acids of pathogens or synthesized DNA.

The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24\u201348 hours after birth, indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection.","publish_time":"2016-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karlsson, Oskar E.; Larsson, Jenny; Hayer, Juliette; Berg, Mikael; Jacobson, Magdalena","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/973fbce23bd8a5e39afc3e02abc9ea33d80a13b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4794121.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982708/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pooled diarrhoeic samples","clinical samples","investigated diarrhoea","healthy piglets","diarrhoeic piglets","known mammalian viruses","Circoviridae","Anelloviridae","viral metagenomics","healthy specimens","viral fraction","Picornaviridae","eukaryotic viruses","present study","Reoviridae","different mammalian virus families","potential viral involvement","Neonatal porcine diarrhoea of uncertain aetiology","transplacental infection","affected herds","particular virus family","resulting sequence data","sequence independent amplification","immediate infection post-partum","taxonomic classification","nucleic acids","Caliciviridae","Adenoviridae","DNA fractions","positive control","birth","Astroviridae","negative controls","Parvoviridae","intestinal virome","mock metagenome","Kraken","Diamond","focus","distal jejunum","Ion Torrent platform","HMMER","hours","hypothesis","intestine","number of European countries","aim","total","conclusion","results"],"language":"en"},

However, the diagnostic process can be challenging due to the high genetic diversity and high mutation rate of PRRSV. A diagnostic method that can provide more detailed genetic information about pathogens is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the ability of Oxford Nanopore MinION direct RNA sequencing to generate a PRRSV whole genome sequence and detect and discriminate virus at the strain-level. A nearly full length PRRSV genome was successfully generated from raw sequence reads, achieving an accuracy of 96% after consensus genome generation. Direct RNA sequencing reliably detected the PRRSV strain present with an accuracy of 99.9% using as few as 5 raw sequencing reads and successfully differentiated multiple co-infecting strains present in a sample. In addition, PRRSV strain information was obtained from clinical samples containing 10(4) to 10(6) viral copies or more within 6 hours of sequencing.

In the last two decades, this is the 3rd deadliest Coronavirus pandemic, following SARS which lasted between 2002 and 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) from 2012 till date. Globally and as of April 1st 2020, COVID-19 has affected 924,688 individuals in over 200 countries, causing 46,368 fatalities. While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland China. SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats. Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures. This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Qahtani, Ahmed A.","journal":"Saudi J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebeef7ed15f08b86ff80ec8aea566c2604476492.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336927/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X20301558; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X20301558?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.04.033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","rapid transmission of SARS","human transmission","COVID","individuals","pandemic of Coronavirus Disease","deadliest Coronavirus pandemic","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","mainland China","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","life-threatening respiratory failure","uncontrolled human","exponential increase","number of cases","review article","confirmed cases","lockdown measures","exponential infection rate","Extreme precautionary measures","possible origins","unique genomic structure","epidemiology","comparison","pathogenesis","numerous loss of lives","emerging treatment strategies","genetic studies","sequence similarity","list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern","report case","deadly species of Coronaviruses","MERS","respect","developing situation","nature","informed literature","PHEIC","curfew","times","reality","bats","deaths","potential","immediate effect","world","countries","borders","group of \u03B2","Abstract","fatalities","decades","date"],"language":"en"},

The efficacy of parenteral administration of widely used modified live virus PRRS vaccine (PRRS-MLV) against genetically divergent PRRSV strains remains questionable. Therefore, we evaluated an alternate and proven mucosal immunization approach by intranasal delivery of PRRS-MLV (strain VR2332) with a potent adjuvant to elicit cross-protective immunity against a heterologous PRRSV (strain MN184). Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) was chosen as a potent mucosal adjuvant due to its Th1 biased immune response to PRRS-MLV. Unvaccinated pigs challenged with MN184 had clinical PRRS with severe lung pathology; however, vaccinated (PRRS-MLV\u002B Mtb WCL) pigs challenged with MN184 were apparently healthy. There was a significant increase in the body weight gain in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated PRRSV challenged pigs. Vaccinated compared to unvaccinated, virus-challenged pigs had reduced lung pathology associated with enhanced PRRSV neutralizing antibody titers and reduced viremia. Immunologically, an increased frequency of Th cells, Th/memory cells, \u03B3\u03B4 T cells, dendritic cells, and activated Th cells and a reduced frequency of T-regulatory cells were detected at both mucosal and systemic sites. Further, reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-\u03B2) and upregulation of the Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03B3 in blood and lungs were detected in mucosally vaccinated, PRRSV-challenged pigs. In conclusion, intranasal immunization of pigs with PRRS-MLV administered with Mtb WCL generated effective cross-protective immunity against PRRSV.","publish_time":"2011-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Patterson, Ruthi; Dodson, Katie; Murtaugh, Michael; Torrelles, Jordi B.; Schlesinger, Larry S.; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c89b34d5fa3de10f80068e5c6741363b8af8ed5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127856.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21419162/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11003586; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11003586","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRS-MLV","Unvaccinated pigs","clinical PRRS","unvaccinated PRRSV","intranasal delivery of PRRS","intranasal immunization of pigs","dendritic cells","memory cells","regulatory cells","enhanced PRRSV","heterologous PRRSV","activated Th cells","\u03B3\u03B4 T cells","increased frequency of Th cells","Mtb WCL","reduced frequency of T","divergent PRRSV strains","modified live virus PRRS vaccine","strain MN184","reduced viremia","immunosuppressive chronic respiratory viral disease of pigs","potent mucosal adjuvant","potent adjuvant","reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines","effective cross-protective immunity","proven mucosal immunization approach","severe lung pathology","respiratory syndrome","strain VR2332","Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03B3","blood","IL","major economic losses","antibody titers","upregulation","body weight gain","lungs","cell lysate","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","immune response","significant increase","swine industry","TGF-\u03B2","efficacy of parenteral administration","conclusion","systemic sites"],"language":"en"},

This ability is generally beneficial to viruses as it allows them to evade host immune responses, evolve new behaviours, and exploit ecological niches. However, natural selection typically generates adaptation in response to the immediate selection pressures that a virus experiences in its current host. Consequently, we argue that some viruses, particularly those characterised by long durations of infection and ongoing replication, may be susceptible to short-sighted evolution, whereby a virus\u2019 adaptation to its current host will be detrimental to its onward transmission within the host population. Here we outline the concept of short-sighted viral evolution and provide examples of how it may negatively impact viral transmission among hosts. We also propose that viruses that are vulnerable to short-sighted evolution may exhibit strategies that minimise its effects. We speculate on the various mechanisms by which this may be achieved, including viral life history strategies that result in low rates of within-host evolution, or the establishment of a \u2018germline\u2019 lineage of viruses that avoids short-sighted evolution.

Site One was PEDV positive; Site Two was PEDV negative. On Site One, pen samples (feces and oral fluids) and pig samples (rectal swabs and sera) were collected both before and after the population was exposed to PEDV. RESULTS: On Site Two, pen oral fluid samples and individual pig serum samples were negative for both PEDV antibody and nucleic acid.

Combination of YW002 with MF59 (MF59-YW002) could confer a potent Th1 biasing property to the adjuvant, which enhanced the immunogenicity of HSP65-MUC1 to induce significantly higher levels of specific IgG2c, increased IFN-\u03B3 mRNA expression in splenocytes and the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in mice.

This study used microbiota high-throughput sequencing to compare the fecal microbial profile of healthy horses to that of geriatric microbial transplant recipients experiencing diarrhea and tested whether FMT restores microbiota diversity. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of environment and donor characteristics on the intestinal microbiota, fecal samples were collected per rectum from 15 healthy young-adult (2\u201312 years) and 15 geriatric (\u226520 years) horses. Additionally, FMT was performed for 3 consecutive days in 5 geriatric horses with diarrhea using feces from the same healthy donor. Fecal samples were collected from both donor and recipient prior to each FMT and from recipients 24 hours following the last FMT. The profile of the fecal bacterial microbiota was compared using 16S amplicon sequencing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to diet and farm location, age did not significantly affect the healthy equine fecal microbiota, indicating that both healthy geriatric and young-adult horses may serve as FMT donors. The fecal microbiota of horses with diarrhea was significantly more variable in terms of \u03B2-diversity than that of healthy horses. An inverse correlation between diarrhea score and relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was identified in surviving FMT recipients. At study completion, the fecal microbiota of horses which responded to FMT had a higher \u03B1-diversity than prior to treatment and was phylogenetically more similar to that of the donor.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"McKinney, Caroline A.; Oliveira, Bruno C.

It is also indispensable for implementing effective control measures for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the possible occurrence of a human influenza pandemic. The present authors, in collaboration with Vietnamese hospital staff, performed a fact-finding survey of nosocomial infection control in hospitals in northern Vietnam and compared the results with those of a survey conducted 4 years previously. Remarkable improvement was recognized in this period, although there were considerable differences between the central hospitals in Hanoi and local hospitals. In the local hospitals, basic techniques and the systems for infection control were regarded as insufficient, and it is necessary to improve these techniques and systems under the guidance of hospitals in the central area.

Detailed evaluations of phenotypic expressions of illness are required to characterize important biological outcomes. We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone. This cross-sectional study was carried out on a dairy calf ranch in the northwestern United States from June to September 2017 and focused on calves \u226490 d of age. Comparisons were made between causes of death based on 3 levels of information: on-farm treatment records alone, necropsy-based postmortem analyses in addition to treatment records, and Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) results in addition to all other information. A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, of which 122 cases were submitted to WADDL. Necropsy- and WADDL-derived mortality phenotypes were in almost perfect agreement (Cohen\u0027s \u03BA = 0.86) when broadly categorized as diarrhea, respiratory, diarrhea and respiratory combined, or other causes. The level of agreement between on-farm treatment records and postmortem-derived results was low and varied by the level of diagnostic detail provided. There was just fair agreement (\u03BA = 0.22) between treatment-based and necropsy-based phenotypes without WADDL input and only slight agreement (\u03BA = 0.13) between treatment-based and corresponding necropsy-based phenotypes with WADDL input. Even for those cases in which causes of death aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death failed to identify meaningful target areas for intervention. This was especially apparent for numerous cases of necrotizing enteritis and typhlitis (cecal inflammation) that were variously categorized as diarrhea and pneumonia by treatment-based diagnoses. The specificity of these lesions stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis and highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McConnel, C.

Adjuvants are commonly used for antigen sparing in other vaccines, and thereby could potentially have major benefits to extend JJA supplies if they were to similarly enhance JJA VIT immunogenicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical and microbiological stability and murine immunogenicity of low-dose JJA VIT formulated with a novel polysaccharide adjuvant referred to as delta inulin or Advax\u2122. Jack Jumper ant venom (JJAV) protein stability was assessed by UPLC-UV, SDS-PAGE, SDS-PAGE immunoblot, and ELISA inhibition. Diffraction light scattering was used to assess particle size distribution of Advax; pH and benzyl alcohol quantification by UPLC-UV were used to assess the physicochemical stability of JJAV diluent, and endotoxin content and preservative efficacy test was used to investigate the microbiological properties of the adjuvanted VIT formulation. To assess the effect of adjuvant on JJA venom immunogenicity, mice were immunised four times with JJAV alone or formulated with Advax adjuvant. JJA VIT formulated with Advax was found to be physicochemically and microbiologically stable for at least 2 days when stored at 4 and 25 \u00B0C with a trend for an increase in allergenic potency observed beyond 2 days of storage. Low-dose JJAV formulated with Advax adjuvant induced significantly higher JJAV-specific IgG than a 5-fold higher dose of JJAV alone, consistent with a powerful allergen-sparing effect. The pharmaceutical data provides important guidance on the formulation, storage and use of JJA VIT formulated with Advax adjuvant, with the murine immunogenicity studies providing a strong rationale for a planned clinical trial to test the ability of Advax adjuvant to achieve 4-fold JJAV dose sparing in JJA-allergic human patients.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wanandy, Troy; Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Davies, Noel W.; Rose, Hayley E.; Heddle, Robert J.; Brown, Simon G.A.; Woodman, Richard J.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Wiese, Michael D.","journal":"Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb45bf15047bada68def9daf2cb3c45b66f728df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127811.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708518322787; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0731708518322787; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2019.04.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JJA","JJA VIT","JJAV","VIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JJA VIT immunogenicity","dose JJA VIT","JJA venom immunogenicity","ability of Advax adjuvant","JJA supplies","Low-dose JJAV","higher dose of JJAV","fold JJAV dose","effect of adjuvant","physicochemical stability of JJAV diluent","adjuvanted VIT formulation","higher JJAV-specific IgG","JJA-allergic human patients","murine immunogenicity of low","scarcity of ant venom","novel polysaccharide adjuvant","microbiological stability","particle size distribution of Advax","murine immunogenicity studies","broader clinical application of Jack Jumper ant venom immunotherapy","protein stability","UPLC-UV","SDS-PAGE","days of storage","powerful allergen-sparing effect","microbiological properties","major challenge","major benefits","planned clinical trial","preservative efficacy test","strong rationale","endotoxin content","benzyl alcohol quantification","mice","important guidance","allergenic potency","delta inulin","trend","increase","pharmaceutical data","Diffraction light scattering","times","ELISA inhibition","antigen","study","wild ants","Adjuvants","vaccines","purpose"],"language":"en"},

We also observed systematic syndrome elevations in the fall, which were unexplained by pathogen counts but likely reflected rhinovirus activity.

In the last few years, environmental viral metagenomics has grown significantly and has enabled the identification, diversity and entire genome sequencing of viruses in environmental and clinical samples extensively. Prior to the arrival of metagenomics, traditional molecular procedures such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, were mostly used to identify and classify enteric viral species in different environmental milieu. After the advent of metagenomics, more detailed reports have emerged about the important waterborne viruses identified in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface water. This paper provides a review of methods that have been used for the concentration, detection and identification of viral species from different environmental matrices. The review also takes into consideration where metagenomics has been explored in different African countries, as well as the limitations and challenges facing the approach. Procedures including sample processing, experimental design, sequencing technology, and bioinformatics analysis are discussed.

Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masters, Paul S.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f085aa777d230139f3ae371f7d28ec3070a6c254.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112330.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352706660053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352706660053","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA synthesis","enveloped RNA viruses","coronavirus genome","molecular interactions","molecular biology","Coronavirus replication","molecular level","emerged coronavirus","viral family","multiple subgenomic RNA species","recognition of viral receptors","genome translation","Abstract Coronaviruses","virion assembly","assembly of progeny virions","causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","pathway","ribosome frameshifting","particular emphasis","study","infectious agents","variety of unusual strategies","nature","contemporary discoveries","development of reverse genetic systems","complex program of gene expression","SARS","past","identification","veterinary importance","processes","years","result","advance","review","enormous size","Progress"],"language":"en"},

Owing to genomic and somatic diversities among viral species, identifying protein targets for broad-spectrum virus neutralization is highly challenging even for the same virus, such as HIV-1. However, viruses rely on host glycosylation machineries to synthesize and express glycans and, thereby, may display common carbohydrate moieties. Thus, exploring glycan-binding profiles of broad-spectrum virus-neutralizing agents may provide key information to uncover the carbohydrate-based virus-neutralizing epitopes. In this study, we characterized two broadly HIV-neutralizing agents, human monoclonal antibody 2G12 and Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA), for their viral targeting activities. Although these agents were known to be specific for oligomannosyl antigens, they differ strikingly in virus-binding activities. The former is HIV-1 specific; the latter is broadly reactive and is able to neutralize viruses of distinct phylogenetic origins, such as HIV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In carbohydrate microarray analyses, we explored the molecular basis underlying the striking differences in the spectrum of anti-virus activities of the two probes. Unlike 2G12, which is strictly specific for the high-density Man(9)GlcNAc(2)Asn (Man9)-clusters, GNA recognizes a number of N-glycan cryptic sugar moieties. These include not only the known oligomannosyl antigens but also previously unrecognized tri-antennary or multi-valent GlcNAc-terminating N-glycan epitopes (Tri/m-Gn). These findings highlight the potential of N-glycan cryptic sugar moieties as conserved targets for broad-spectrum virus neutralization and suggest the GNA-model of glycan-binding warrants focused investigation.","publish_time":"2015-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Denong; Tang, Jin; Tang, Jiulai; Wang, Lai-Xi","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71f45bcdac8e83e02ee1d8b5eab8ce5c425f5cce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4633014.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules20034610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25774492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Galanthus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-binding activities","broad-spectrum virus neutralization","glycan-binding profiles of broad-spectrum virus","carbohydrate-based virus","HIV","spectrum of anti-virus activities","glycan cryptic sugar moieties","agents","molecular targets","common carbohydrate moieties","viral targeting activities","glycan-binding warrants focused investigation","multi-valent GlcNAc-terminating N-glycan epitopes","number of N","potential of N","conserved targets","protein targets","GNA-model","viral species","known oligomannosyl antigens","emerging viral pathogens","carbohydrate microarray analyses","human monoclonal antibody 2G12","human cytomegalovirus","key steps","key information","molecular basis","unrecognized tri-antennary","viruses of distinct phylogenetic origins","Galanthus nivalis lectin","SARS-CoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","development of vaccines","striking differences","host glycosylation machineries","somatic diversities","clusters","Man9","express glycans","Asn","high-density Man","antibodies","probes","HCMV","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

The frequent lack of a microbiological diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy. This study assessed the use of comprehensive multibacterial, multiviral molecular testing, including quantification, in adults hospitalized with CAP. Methods. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for 323 adults with radiologically-confirmed CAP admitted to 2 UK tertiary care hospitals. Sputum (96%) or endotracheal aspirate (4%) specimens were cultured as per routine practice and also tested with fast multiplex real-time polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assays for 26 respiratory bacteria and viruses. Bacterial loads were also calculated for 8 bacterial pathogens. Appropriate pathogen-directed therapy was retrospectively assessed using national guidelines adapted for local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Results. Comprehensive molecular testing of single lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens achieved pathogen detection in 87% of CAP patients compared with 39% with culture-based methods. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the main agents detected, along with a wide variety of typical and atypical pathogens. Viruses were present in 30% of cases; 82% of these were codetections with bacteria. Most (85%) patients had received antimicrobials in the 72 hours before admission. Of these, 78% had a bacterial pathogen detected by PCR but only 32% were culture-positive (P \u003C .0001). Molecular testing had the potential to enable de-escalation in number and/or spectrum of antimicrobials in 77% of patients. Conclusions. Comprehensive molecular testing significantly improves pathogen detection in CAP, particularly in antimicrobial-exposed patients, and requires only a single LRT specimen. It also has the potential to enable early de-escalation from broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials to pathogen-directed therapy.","publish_time":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gadsby, Naomi J.; Russell, Clark D.; McHugh, Martin P.; Mark, Harriet; Conway Morris, Andrew; Laurenson, Ian F.; Hill, Adam T.; Templeton, Kate E.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4d27546d0c58950f8d8e84a0de97d90a1d4cf52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4787606.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747825/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ1214","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CAP","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogen detection","CAP patients","Appropriate pathogen","multiviral molecular testing","antimicrobial therapy","antimicrobial-exposed patients","Comprehensive molecular testing of single lower respiratory tract","bacterial pathogens","specimens","PCR","respiratory bacteria","spectrum of antimicrobials","potential","adults","viruses","Bacterial loads","use of comprehensive multibacterial","broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials","single LRT specimen","culture-based methods","early de-escalation","local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns","atypical pathogens","culture-positive","fast multiplex real-time polymerase-chain reaction","assays","national guidelines","Streptococcus pneumoniae","microbiological diagnosis","community","wide variety of typical","main agents","number","quantification","UK tertiary care hospitals","Haemophilus influenzae","frequent lack","routine practice","laboratory data","study","endotracheal aspirate","hours","admission","cases","Sputum","codetections","Background","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.

They are obtained by fractionating plasma collected from immunized horses or, less frequently, sheep. Manufacturing processes usually include pepsin digestion at acid pH, papain digestion, ammonium sulphate precipitation, caprylic acid precipitation, heat coagulation and/or chromatography. Most production processes do not have deliberately introduced viral inactivation or removal treatments, but antivenoms have never been found to transmit viruses to humans. Nevertheless, the recent examples of zoonotic diseases highlight the need to perform a careful assessment of the viral safety of antivenoms. This paper reviews the characteristics of equine viruses of antivenoms and discusses the potential of some manufacturing steps to avoid risks of viral contamination. Analysis of production parameters indicate that acid pH treatments and caprylic acid precipitations, which have been validated for the manufacture of some human IgG products, appear to provide the best potential for viral inactivation of antivenoms. As many manufacturers of antivenoms located in developing countries lack the resources to conduct formal viral validation studies, it is hoped that this review will help in the scientific understanding of the viral safety factors of antivenoms, in the controlled implementation of the manufacturing steps with expected impact on viral safety, and in the overall reinforcement of good manufacturing practices of these essential therapeutic products.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burnouf, Thierry; Griffiths, Elwyn; Padilla, Ana; Seddik, Salwa; Stephano, Marco Antonio; Guti\u00E9rrez, Jos\u00E9-Mar\u00EDa","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92cd430f7765db6f85a051c9b4ef902db68890da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128792.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105604000223; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105604000223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral safety of antivenoms","viral inactivation of antivenoms","viral safety factors of antivenoms","manufacturers of antivenoms","Abstract Antivenoms","manufacturing steps","Manufacturing processes","risks of viral contamination","characteristics of equine viruses of antivenoms","acid pH treatments","formal viral validation studies","caprylic acid precipitations","human IgG products","production processes","overall reinforcement of good manufacturing practices","papain digestion","pepsin digestion","removal treatments","marine animals","best potential","human medicine","ammonium sulphate precipitation","essential therapeutic products","stings of various animals","Analysis of production parameters","resources","preparations of intact","heat coagulation","expected impact","need","bites","spiders","scientific understanding","controlled implementation","severe envenomings","developing countries","careful assessment","contact","snakes","scorpions","recent examples of zoonotic diseases","immunized horses","immunoglobulin G","fractionating plasma","paper","poisonous plants","review","chromatography","sheep","humans"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the RBD. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus whereby the SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pati\u00F1o-Galindo, Juan \u00C1ngel; Filip, Ioan; AlQuraishi, Mohammed; Rabadan, Raul","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71447d93d7e47b284ff1956763d5fe89a0e4a9c7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/69008e4d4e158ae9484c3821e4384aa5948c3209.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.942748","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Receptor Binding Domain","RBD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","RBD","genetic characteristics of SARS","recombination event","emergence","recent common ancestor","human-infecting viruses","human ACE2 receptor","recent outbreak","unique changes","common process","adaptation of zoonotic viruses","Receptor Binding Domain","significant number of amino acid changes","RaTG13","ancestors","bats","new coronavirus","incorporation","need","betacoronaviruses","evolutionary processes","Ancestral state analyses","similar genotype","helix","humans","insertions","Wuhan","years","result","Spike gene","China","positions","scenario","lineage","alleles","sum"],"language":"en"},

While some IBV strains replicate locally, others can disseminate to various organs, including the kidney. Here, we elucidate the determinants for kidney tropism by studying interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral attachment protein spike from two IBV strains with different tropisms. Recombinantly produced RBDs from the nephropathogenic IBV strain QX and from the nonnephropathogenic strain M41 bound to the epithelial cells of the trachea. In contrast, only QX-RBD binds more extensively to cells of the digestive tract, urogenital tract, and kidneys. While removal of sialic acids from tissues prevented binding of all proteins to all tissues, binding of QX-RBD to trachea and kidney could not be blocked by preincubation with synthetic alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. The lack of binding of QX-RBD to a previously identified IBV-M41 receptor was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrating that tissue binding of QX-RBD is dependent on a different sialylated glycan receptor. Using chimeric RBD proteins, we discovered that the region encompassing amino acids 99 to 159 of QX-RBD was required to establish kidney binding. In particular, QX-RBD amino acids 110 to 112 (KIP) were sufficient to render IBV-M41 with the ability to bind to kidney, while the reciprocal mutations in IBV-QX abolished kidney binding completely. Structural analysis of both RBDs suggests that the receptor-binding site for QX is located at a different location on the spike than that of M41. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens. Upon infection of chicken flocks, the poultry industry faces substantial economic losses by diminished egg quality and increased morbidity and mortality of infected animals. While all IBV strains infect the chicken respiratory tract via the ciliated epithelial layer of the trachea, some strains can also replicate in the kidneys, dividing IBV into the following two pathotypes: nonnephropathogenic (example, IBV-M41) and nephropathogenic viruses (including IBV-QX). Here, we set out to identify the determinants for the extended nephropathogenic tropism of IBV-QX.

Preparedness and response plans for such outbreaks are crucial, and given the centrality of the Internet as a source of information on university and college campuses, such plans should be made available at pandemic-dedicated university Web sites. The information on these sites must be comprehensive, accessible, and tailored to the specific circumstances of individual schools. Methods An Internet-based search was conducted in September 2009 to evaluate university Web sites for influenza-specific information in a sample of 51 universities. Web sites were assessed by applying a set of key words and a list of 10 indicators used as measures of accessibility and comprehensiveness. Results Of the 51 universities evaluated, only 9 (17.6%) either had no influenza Web site or had a university influenza preparedness plan with no dedicated Web site. Only 6 (14.3%) of the schools with influenza specific Web sites had information for parents, with 23 (54.8%) providing information specifically for faculty and staff, and 24 (57.1%) providing information specifically to students. Conclusion We found no guidelines for maximizing the access to and effectiveness of online pandemic communications at institutions of higher learning. Until such time as appropriate guidelines are developed, university authorities must carefully assess their needs, taking into account local, national, and international public health circumstances and resources; ease of access; comprehensiveness; and appropriately tailored strategies in their online communications.","publish_time":"2012-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwartz, Rachel D.; Bayles, Brett R.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a08a771ff59210cff2cc20273025f4caf44e54c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21782280/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655311002161; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655311002161; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2011.02.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza specific Web sites","influenza-specific information","influenza Web site","pandemic-dedicated university Web sites","university influenza preparedness plan","avian influenza","source of information","dedicated Web site","university authorities","novel H1N1 influenza pandemic","effectiveness of online pandemic communications","online communications","specific circumstances of individual schools","comprehensiveness","universities","ease of access","response plans","appropriate guidelines","tailored strategies","Internet-based search","international public health circumstances","recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome","resources","H5N1","list","institutions of higher learning","account local","college campuses","danger of new","indicators","needs","awareness","sample","set of key words","parents","measures of accessibility","emerging infections","Methods","centrality","time","faculty","staff","Results","Conclusion","students"],"language":"en"},

This proteinase domain is flanked on both sides by hydrophobic, potentially membrane-spanning, regions. Cell-free expression of a plasmid encoding only the 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) resulted in the synthesis of a 29-kDa protein that was specifically recognized by an antibody directed against the carboxy-terminal region of the proteinase. A protein of identical mobility was detected in MHV-A59-infected cell lysates.In vitroexpression of a plasmid encoding the 3CLpro and portions of the two flanking hydrophobic regions resulted in inefficient processing of the 29-kDa protein. However, the efficiency of this processing event was enhanced by the addition of canine pancreatic microsomes to the translation reaction, or removal of one of the flanking hydrophobic domains. Proteolysis was inhibited in the presence ofN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or by mutagenesis of the catalytic cysteine residue of the proteinase, indicating that the 3CLpro is responsible for its autoproteolytic cleavage from the flanking domains. Microsomal membranes were unable to enhance thetransprocessing of a precursor containing the inactive proteinase domain and both hydrophobic regions by a recombinant 3CLpro expressed fromEscherichia coli.Membrane association assays demonstrated that the 29-kDa 3CLpro was present in the soluble fraction of the reticulocyte lysates, while polypeptides containing the hydrophobic domains associated with the membrane pellets. With the help of a viral epitope tag, we identified a 22-kDa membrane-associated polypeptide as the proteolytic product containing the amino-terminal hydrophobic domain.","publish_time":"1997-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pi\u00F1\u00F3n, Josefina D.; Mayreddy, Ravi R.; Turner, Julie D.; Khan, Farah S.; Bonilla, Pedro J.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae26337e6fe2ba4e94f90b8884854b18eabb6dfe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297985032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297985032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLpro","flanking hydrophobic regions","flanking hydrophobic domains","proteinase similar","kDa protein","inactive proteinase domain","amino-terminal hydrophobic domain","flanking domains","kDa membrane-associated polypeptide","membrane pellets","membrane-spanning","Membrane association assays","plasmid","coronavirus MHV-A59","infected cell lysates","protein of identical mobility","reticulocyte lysates","inefficient processing","processing event","carboxy-terminal region","Cell-free expression","C proteinases of picornaviruses","fromEscherichia coli","proteolytic product","mutagenesis","thetransprocessing","translation reaction","addition of canine pancreatic microsomes","soluble fraction","precursor","serine","autoproteolytic cleavage","portions","presence ofN-ethylmaleimide","NEM","catalytic cysteine residue","vitroexpression","removal","polypeptides","sides","replicase gene","help","viral epitope tag","Microsomal membranes","synthesis","Proteolysis","efficiency","antibody"],"language":"en"},

The recombinant isolation frequency was about 10\u22129recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7-fold higher at the 5\u2032-end of the S gene than in other areas of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and characterized phenotypically and genetically. All recombinant viruses had a single crossover and had inherited the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-halves of their genome from the enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were classified into three groups, named 1 to 3, according to the location of the crossover. Group 1 recombinants had the crossover in the S gene, while in Groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located in ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. Recombinants of Group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory, but not the enteric, tract. Viruses of both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may be in principle responsible for the loss of enteric tropism but only the change in nucleotide 655 was specifically found in the respiratory isolates and most likely this single nucleotide change, which leads to a substitution in amino acid 219 of the S protein, was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in the closely related PUR-46 isolates. The available data indicate that in order to infect enteric tract cells with TGEV, two different domains of the S protein, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively, are involved. The first domain binds to porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for TGEV. In the other domain maps a second factor of undefined nature but which may be the binding site for a coreceptor essential for the enteric tropism of TGEV.","publish_time":"1997-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ballesteros, M.

Maternal derived antibody-mediated immunity (AMI) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) are critical immediate defenses for the neonate; however, MDI may interfere with the induction of active immunity in the neonate, i.e. passive interference. The effect of antigen-specific MDI on vaccine-induced AMI and CMI responses to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) was assessed in neonatal piglets. To determine whether CMI and AMI responses could be induced in piglets with MDI, piglets with high and low levels of maternal M. hyopneumoniae-specific immunity were vaccinated against M. hyopneumoniae at 7 d of age. Piglet M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibody, lymphoproliferation, and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses were measured 7 d and 14 d post vaccination. RESULTS: Piglets with M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI failed to show vaccine-induced AMI responses; there was no rise in M. hyopneumoniae antibody levels following vaccination of piglets in the presence of M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI. However, piglets with M. hyopneumoniae-specific MDI had primary (antigen-specific lymphoproliferation) and secondary (DTH) M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI responses following vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: In this study neonatal M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI was not subject to passive interference by MDI. Further, it appears that both maternal derived and endogenous CMI contribute to M. hyopneumoniae-specific CMI responses in piglets vaccinated in the face of MDI.","publish_time":"2014-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bandrick, Meggan; Theis, Kara; Molitor, Thomas W","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2738ed5788b2eb1a42164c7ddff227105d5ae617.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4065585.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDI","AMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hyopneumoniae-specific MDI","hyopneumoniae-specific immunity","hyopneumoniae-specific CMI responses","hyopneumoniae-specific antibody","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae","hyopneumoniae antibody levels","vaccination of piglets","face of MDI","antigen-specific lymphoproliferation","neonatal piglets","endogenous CMI","maternal derived immunity","vaccine-induced AMI responses","Maternal derived antibody-mediated immunity","cell-mediated immunity","low levels of maternal","induction of active immunity","d post vaccination","DTH","neonate","passive interference","d of age","effect of antigen","study neonatal","delayed type hypersensitivity","primary","critical immediate defenses","rise","presence","BACKGROUND","double-edged sword","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

EMCV VP1 protein was one of the most important structural proteins and played an important role in the protective immunity. In this study, 10 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against EMCV VP1 were screened and identified. RESULTS: Epitope mapping results indicated that McAbs (6E11, 7A7, 7C9) specifically recognized the linear epitopes V(2)ENAEK(7), McAbs (1D1, 2A2, 5A1, 5A11, 5G1) recognized the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25), and McAbs 1G8 and 3A9 recognized P(42)IGAFTVK(49). Protein sequence alignment of VP1 with 16 EMCV isolates indicated that the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25) was conserved in all the reference strains. The epitopes P(42)IGAFTVK(49) and V(2)ENAEK(7) only had 1 or 2 variable amino acid among the reference strains. The 3D model analysis results showed that these epitopes presented as spheres were shown within the context of the complete particle. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, ten McAbs against EMCV VP1 were developed and three B-cells epitopes (2-7aa, 19-25aa and 42-49aa) were defined in VP1.

The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. METHODS: In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The value of R(0) was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. CONCLUSIONS: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Tian-Mu; Rui, Jia; Wang, Qiu-Peng; Zhao, Ze-Yu; Cui, Jing-An; Yin, Ling","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7047374.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32111262/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","International Committee"],"locations":["Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market","Middle East","Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["Reservoir-People transmission network model","Reservoir network","RP model","mathematical model","SARS-CoV","transmissibility of SARS","person","Middle East respiratory syndrome","potential transmission","Bats-Hosts","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","study","Middle East countries","novel coronavirus","value of R","infection source","human infection","causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology","basic reproduction number","expected number of secondary infections","Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market","MERS","Chinese authorities","World Health Organization","single infected individual","International Committee","susceptible population","Taxonomy of Viruses","nCoV","public concerns","Republic of Korea","generation matrix approach","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

These strategies were tested during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. This article assesses pandemic preparedness in Taipei in the wake of recent pandemic experiences in order to draw lessons relevant to the broader international public health community. Drawing on Taiwan and Taipei Centers for Disease Control data on pandemic response and control, we evaluated the effectiveness of the changes in pandemic response policies developed by these governments over time, emphasizing hospital and medical interventions with particular attention paid to Traffic Control Bundling. SARS and H1N1 2009 catalysed the Taiwan and Taipei CDCs to continuously improve and adjust their strategies for a future pandemic. These new strategies for pandemic response and control have been largely effective at providing interim pandemic containment and control, while development and implementation of an effective vaccination programme is underway. As Taipei\u0027s experiences with these cases illustrate, in mitigating moderate or severe pandemic influenza, a graduated process including Traffic Control Bundles accompanied by hospital and medical interventions, as well as school- and community-focused interventions, provides an effective interim response while awaiting vaccine development. Once a vaccine is developed, to maximize pandemic control effectiveness, it should be allocated with priority given to vulnerable groups, healthcare workers and school children.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yen, M.-Y.; Chiu, A.W.-H.; Schwartz, J.; King, C.-C.; Lin, Y.

The Canadian government underlined that these infectious disease outbreaks are threats to global health security and disrupt societal wellbeing and development. In this context, the Public Health Agency of Canada is proactive and has shown its preparedness for outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, and in dealing with these pathogens.

This detects all five mRNAs because of the 3\u2032-coterminal, nested-set arrangement of coronavirus mRNAs. The mRNAs were readily detected even after extensive purification of virions and after RNase A treatment of virions. In sucrose gradients the peaks of virus particles, genomic RNA (gRNA), and mRNAs were coincident. Cellular mRNA was not detected in virions. The molar ratio of gRNA to each mRNA ranged from about 10 to 30 for IBV-Beaudette and 25 to 800 for IBV-M41. The molar ratio of genomic to intracellular viral mRNAs was also determined. From this it was estimated that the efficiency of incorporation of gRNA into virions was at least 20- to 100-fold greater, depending on the mRNA species, for IBV-Beaudette and 100- to 500-fold for IBV-M41. It is concluded that most virions contain only gRNA or contain only one species of mRNA on average in addition to gRNA.","publish_time":"1993-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, X.; Shaw, K.; Cavanagh, D.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283714650; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283714650","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virions of IBV","treatment of virions","IBV-Beaudette","IBV-M41","molar ratio of gRNA","mRNA species","species of mRNA","extensive purification of virions","intracellular viral mRNAs","arrangement of coronavirus mRNAs","presence of subgenomic mRNAs","Cellular mRNA","genomic RNA","molar ratio of genomic","fold","Northern blots of RNA","peaks of virus particles","RNase","terminal nucleocapsid protein","gene","sucrose gradients","average","addition","coterminal","cDNA","efficiency of incorporation","probe"],"language":"en"},

Currently the efficacy of available live attenuated or killed vaccines against IBV has been challenged. We designed a novel IBV vaccine alternative using a highly innovative platform called Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticle (SAPN). In this vaccine, B cell epitopes derived from the second heptad repeat (HR2) region of IBV spike proteins were repetitively presented in its native trimeric conformation. In addition, flagellin was co-displayed in the SAPN to achieve a self-adjuvanted effect. Three groups of chickens were immunized at four weeks of age with the vaccine prototype, IBV-Flagellin-SAPN, a negative-control construct Flagellin-SAPN or a buffer control. The immunized chickens were challenged with 5x10(4.7) EID50 IBV M41 strain. High antibody responses were detected in chickens immunized with IBV-Flagellin-SAPN. In ex vivo proliferation tests, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from IBV-Flagellin-SAPN immunized chickens had a significantly higher stimulation index than that of PBMCs from chickens receiving Flagellin-SAPN. Chickens immunized with IBV-Flagellin-SAPN had a significant reduction of tracheal virus shedding and lesser tracheal lesion scores than did negative control chickens.

In both children and kittens there is a significant association between aEPEC burden and diarrheal disease, however the infection can be found in individuals with and without diarrhea. It remains unclear to what extent, under what conditions, or by what mechanisms aEPEC serves as a primary pathogen in individuals with diarrhea. It seems likely that a combination of host and bacterial factors enable aEPEC to cause disease in some individuals and not in others. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of aEPEC on intestinal function and diarrhea in kittens following experimentally-induced carriage and the influence of a disrupted intestinal microbiota on disease susceptibility. Results of this study identify aEPEC as a potential pathogen in kittens. In the absence of disruption to the intestinal microbiota, kittens are resistant to clinical signs of aEPEC carriage but demonstrate significant occult changes in intestinal absorption and permeability. Antibiotic-induced disruption of the intestinal microbiota prior to infection increases subsequent intestinal water loss as determined by % fecal wet weight. Enrichment of the intestinal microbiota with a commensal member of the feline mucosa-associated microbiota, Enterococcus hirae, ameliorated the effects of aEPEC experimental infection on intestinal function and water loss. These observations begin to unravel the mechanisms by which aEPEC infection may be able to exploit susceptible hosts.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watson, Victoria E.; Jacob, Megan E.; Bruno-B\u00E1rcena, Jos\u00E9 M.; Amirsultan, Sophia; Stauffer, Stephen H.; P\u00EDqueras, Victoria O.; Frias, Rafael; Gookin, Jody L.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fa2c0930c45166df9c712ba4df990da8d0d7261.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d1ce2321a8a67ec9c9823cb9c15543fce565ed85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532395.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955810/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518314160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518314160; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.03.020; https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/10138/313432/1/1_s2.0_S0378113518314160_main.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aEPEC infection","mechanisms aEPEC","intestinal function","aEPEC burden","impact of aEPEC","kittens","disrupted intestinal microbiota","intestinal absorption","effects of aEPEC experimental infection","subsequent intestinal water loss","clinical signs of aEPEC carriage","individuals","diarrheal disease","feline mucosa-associated microbiota","induced carriage","disease susceptibility","children","study","Antibiotic-induced disruption","significant association","primary pathogen","potential pathogen","absence of disruption","diarrheal mortality","significant occult changes","Enterococcus hirae","commensal member","tEPEC","highest hazard of death","bacterial factors","influence","combination of host","atypical EPEC","coli","permeability","Typical enteropathogenic","fecal wet weight","conditions","susceptible hosts","extent","Results","Enrichment","purpose","observations"],"language":"en"},

One of these, HC-Pro, is a multifunctional protein that autolytically cleaves at its carboxyl-terminus (J. C. Carrington et al., 1989, EMBO J. 8, 365\u2013370). To identify the class of proteinase to which HC-Pro belongs, tobacco etch virus (TEV) HC-Pro mutants containing single amino acid substitutions at serine, cysteine, aspartic acid, and histidine positions were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation and were tested for autoproteolytic activity. Combinations of these residues are constituents of the active sites of diverse groups of cellular and viral proteinases. Only those positions that were strictly conserved among four potyvirus HC-Pro proteolytic domains (for which sequences have been deduced) were mutagenized. Of the 19 mutant proteinases synthesized and tested, only those with alterations at Cys-649 and His-722 were defective for HC-Pro autolytic activity. Most of the other mutant proteinases exhibited no impairments in processing kinetics experiments. The spectrum of essential residues, as defined by this genetic analysis, supports the hypothesis that HC-Pro most closely resembles members of the cysteine-type family of proteinases.","publish_time":"1989-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Chan-Seok; Carrington, James C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289905825; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289905825","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

The complete genome of strain SHXB was sequenced, and its sequence was compared those of other TGEV strains in the GenBank database. The comparison showed that there were no insertions or deletions in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032- non-translated regions, in the nonstructural genes ORF1, ORF3, and ORF7, or in the genes encoding the structural proteins envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N). A phenomenon in common with other strains was that nucleotide (nt) 655 of the spike (S) gene was G, and a common change in nt 1753 of the S gene was a T-to-G mutation that caused a serine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 585, which is in the region of the main major antigenic sites A and B of the TGEV S protein. A 6-nt deletion was also found at nt 1123-1128 in all Purdue strains except the strain Virulent Purdue.

There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China.

Immunogenicity and efficacy studies were conducted in cotton rats comparing a recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine with palivizumab and controlled with live RSV virus intranasal immunization and, formalin inactivated RSV vaccine. Active immunization with RSV F nanoparticle vaccine containing an alum adjuvant induced serum levels of palivizumab competing antibody (PCA) greater than passive administration of 15mg/kg palivizumab (human prophylactic dose) in cotton rats and neutralized RSV-A and RSV-B viruses. Immunization prevented detectable RSV replication in the lungs and, unlike passive administration of palivizumab, in the nasal passage of challenged cotton rats. Histology of lung tissues following RSV challenge showed no enhanced disease in the vaccinated groups in contrast to formalin inactivated \u2018Lot 100\u2019 vaccine. Passive intramuscular administration of RSV F vaccine-induced immune sera one day prior to challenge of cotton rats reduced viral titers by 2 or more log10 virus per gram of lung and nasal tissue and at doses less than palivizumab.

Yet, to date, there is no solution for reliably deploying at the point of need the gold standard diagnostic method, real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in a laboratory infrastructure-free manner. In this proof of principle work, we demonstrate direct performance of RT-qPCR on fresh blood using far-red fluorophores to resolve fluorogenic signal inhibition and controlled, rapid freeze/thawing to achieve viral genome extraction in a single reaction chamber assay. The resulting process is entirely free of manual or automated sample pre-processing, requires no microfluidics or magnetic/mechanical sample handling and thus utilizes low cost consumables. This enables a fast, laboratory infrastructure-free, minimal risk and simple standard operating procedure suited to frontline, field use. Developing this novel approach on recombinant bacteriophage and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Lentivirus), we demonstrate clinical utility in symptomatic EBOV patient screening using live, infectious Filoviruses and surrogate patient samples. Moreover, we evidence assay co-linearity independent of viral particle structure that may enable viral load quantification through pre-calibration, with no loss of specificity across an 8 log-linear maximum dynamic range. The resulting quantitative rapid identification (QuRapID) molecular diagnostic platform, openly accessible for assay development, meets the requirements of resource-limited countries and provides a fast response solution for mass public health screening against emerging biosecurity threats.","publish_time":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, Kavit; Bentley, Emma; Tyler, Adam; Richards, Kevin S.

Disease-related worry can help disease prevention and management, but can also have a detrimental effect. This study measured the overall level of disease-related worry during the MERS outbreak period in Korea and the influencing factors and levels of disease-related worry during key outbreak periods. METHODS: The cross-sectional survey included 1,000 adults who resided in Korea. An ordinal logistic regression was performed for the overall level of MERS-related worry, and influencing factors of worry were analyzed. A reliability test was performed on the levels of MERS-related worry during key outbreak periods. RESULTS: The overall level of MERS-related worry was 2.44. Multivariate analysis revealed that women and respondents w very poor subjective health status had higher levels of worry. Respondents with very high stress in daily life had higher levels of worry than those who reported having little stress. The reliability test results on MERS-related worry scores during key outbreak periods showed consistent scores during each period. CONCLUSION: Level of worry increased in cases having higher perceived susceptibility and greater trust in informal information, while initial stage of outbreak was closely associated with that at later stages. These findings suggest the importance of managing the level of worry by providing timely and accurate disease-related information during the initial stage of disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2017-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ro, Jun-Soo; Lee, Jin-Seok; Kang, Sung-Chan; Jung, Hye-Min","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/365b0a8e08cc9c93c6e5b33e23ef3d4399953870.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5342218.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["disease-related worry","Level of worry","MERS-related worry scores","factors of worry","higher levels of worry","levels of MERS","levels of disease","MERS outbreak period","overall level of MERS","overall level of disease","accurate disease-related information","initial stage of disease outbreak","key outbreak periods","initial stage of outbreak","disease prevention","Korea","early stage","influencing factors","reliability test results","higher perceived susceptibility","informal information","respondents w","consistent scores","high stress","little stress","poor subjective health status","greater trust","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","daily life","women","cases","risk communication","Multivariate analysis","cross-sectional survey","adults","ordinal logistic regression","importance","management","study","difficulties","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","detrimental effect","later stages","findings"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We reviewed the cases of RVI in allo\u2010HSCT recipients and explored the predictive value of the immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) established for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and its applicability for RVI caused by other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: RVI occurred year\u2010round in our tropical transplant center, with peaks in the middle and end of the year. Ninety\u2010five of the 195 recipients developed a total of 191 episodes of RVI, giving a cumulative incidence of 28% by 6 months and 52% by 24 months for the first episode of RVI. RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza were the most common viruses. Pneumonia occurred in 63.64%, 42.31%, and 32.42% of adenovirus, influenza, and RSV RVI episodes, respectively, but was also non\u2010negligible in the more benign viruses, such as coronavirus (31.58%) and rhinovirus (23.68%). Nineteen of the 63 episodes of viral pneumonia required mechanical ventilation and 14 deaths occurred within 6 weeks of the RVI. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that an ISI of \u22658 predicted pneumonia with a positive predictive value of \u003E80% for RVI caused by RSV, influenza, adenovirus, and parainfluenza, while it was not predictive for coronavirus and rhinovirus.

Based on clinical studies, SARS-CoV (the SARS-associated coronavirus), a novel coronavirus, is reported as the pathogen responsible for the disease. To date, no effective and specific therapeutic method can be used to treat patients suffering from SARS-CoV infection. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which the introduced small interfering RNA (siRNA) could cause the degradation of mRNA with identical sequence specificity. The RNAi methodology has been used as a tool to silence genes in cultured cells and in animals. Recently, this technique was employed in anti-virus infections in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C/B virus. In this study, RNAi technology has been applied to explore the possibility for prevention of SARS-CoV infection. We constructed specific siRNAs targeting the S gene in SARS-CoV. We demonstrated that the siRNAs could effectively and specifically inhibit gene expression of Spike protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells.

Since 2010, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and US CDC have conducted surveillance to detect known and new etiologies of severe pneumonia. METHODS: Surveillance for severe community-acquired pneumonia was initiated in December 2010 among 30 hospitals in 17 provinces covering all regions of Thailand. Interlinked clinical, laboratory, pathological and epidemiological components of the network were created with specialized guidelines for each to aid case investigation and notification. Severe pneumonia was defined as chest-radiograph confirmed pneumonia of unknown etiology in a patient hospitalized \u226448 h and requiring intubation with ventilator support or who died within 48 h after hospitalization; patients with underlying chronic pulmonary or neurological disease were excluded. Respiratory and pathological specimens were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 14 bacteria. Cases were reported via a secure web-based system. RESULTS: Of specimens from 972 cases available for testing during December 2010 through December 2015, 589 (60.6%) had a potential etiology identified; 399 (67.8%) were from children aged \u003C 5 years. At least one viral agent was detected in 394 (40.5%) cases, with the most common of single vial pathogen detected being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (110/589, 18.7%) especially in children under 5 years. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 341 cases of which 67 cases had apparent mixed infections. The system added MERS-CoV testing in September 2012 as part of Thailand\u2019s outbreak preparedness; no cases were identified from the 767 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced surveillance improved the understanding of the etiology of severe pneumonia cases and improved the MOPH\u2019s preparedness and response capacity for emerging respiratory pathogens in Thailand thereby enhanced global health security. Guidelines for investigation of severe pneumonia from this project were incorporated into surveillance and research activities within Thailand and shared for adaption by other countries.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bunthi, Charatdao; Baggett, Henry C.; Gregory, Christopher J.; Thamthitiwat, Somsak; Yingyong, Thitipong; Paveenkittiporn, Wantana; Kerdsin, Anusak; Chittaganpitch, Malinee; Ruangchira-urai, Ruchira; Akarasewi, Pasakorn; Ungchusak, Kumnuan","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9f0d3495e6f8f04b60c9e1cf9a3cf1423d51cc7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6696659.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326941/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-6774-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US CDC","MOPH"],"locations":["Thailand","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["etiology of severe pneumonia cases","investigation of severe pneumonia","pneumonia of unknown etiology","cases available","new etiologies of severe pneumonia","severe community","Enhanced surveillance","regions of Thailand","routine disease surveillance","potential etiology","emerging respiratory pathogens","Thailand Ministry of Public Health","respiratory syncytial virus","pathological specimens","MERS-CoV testing","children","years","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","MOPH\u2019s preparedness","neurological disease","specialized guidelines","Bacterial pathogens","aid case investigation","global health security","Thailand\u2019s outbreak preparedness","secure web-based system","viruses","response capacity","patients","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","understanding","common of single vial pathogen","laboratory","hospitalization","network","chest-radiograph","project","epidemiological components","US CDC","research activities","ventilator support","apparent mixed infections","intubation","notification","RSV","provinces","adaption","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","hospitals","RESULTS","viral agent","countries","samples"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, this class of drug promotes gene delivery by facilitating lentiviral vector entry into cells, revealing its potential to improve gene therapy efforts. However, the precise mechanism was unknown. Here, we report that mTOR inhibitor treatment results in down-regulation of the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITM proteins, especially IFITM3, are potent inhibitors of virus\u2013cell fusion and are broadly active against a range of pathogenic viruses. We found that the effect of rapamycin treatment on lentiviral transduction is diminished upon IFITM silencing or knockout in primary and transformed cells, and the extent of transduction enhancement depends on basal expression of IFITM proteins, with a major contribution from IFITM3. The effect of rapamycin treatment on IFITM3 manifests at the level of protein, but not mRNA, and is selective, as many other endosome-associated transmembrane proteins are unaffected. Rapamycin-mediated degradation of IFITM3 requires endosomal trafficking, ubiquitination, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, and lysosomal acidification. Since IFITM proteins exhibit broad antiviral activity, we show that mTOR inhibition also promotes infection by another IFITM-sensitive virus, Influenza A virus, but not infection by Sendai virus, which is IFITM-resistant. Our results identify the molecular basis by which mTOR inhibitors enhance virus entry into cells and reveal a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive feature of these clinically important drugs. In addition, this study uncovers a functional convergence between the mTOR pathway and IFITM proteins at endolysosomal membranes.","publish_time":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Guoli; Ozog, Stosh; Torbett, Bruce E.; Compton, Alex A.","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/103228b102f34e60c7057cc68069d00194959837.json; document_parses/pdf_json/37feea85864da899f6c9b22a7d89c8598fa38a29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6205447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301809/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811892115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapamycin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM-sensitive virus","IFITM silencing","IFITM-resistant","mTOR inhibitors","basal expression of IFITM proteins","transmembrane proteins","virus entry","effect of rapamycin treatment","potent inhibitors of virus","mTOR pathway","cells","Sendai virus","mTOR inhibition","Rapamycin-mediated degradation of IFITM3","mTOR inhibitor treatment results","IFITM3 manifests","specific inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin","lentiviral transduction","infection","lentiviral vector entry","endosomal trafficking","gene delivery","endosomal sorting complex","extent of transduction enhancement","gene therapy efforts","ESCRT","ubiquitination","transport","functional convergence","regulation","potential","cell fusion","derivatives","broad antiviral activity","Influenza","level of protein","unrecognized immunosuppressive feature","molecular basis","endolysosomal membranes","well-established immunosuppressants","machinery","endosome","knockout","kinase","major contribution","antitumorigenic agents","important drugs","class of drug","range of pathogenic viruses","mRNA","lysosomal acidification","study","IFN","precise mechanism","addition"],"language":"en"},

The whole genome encompassing the two open reading frames encoding for non\u2010structural (NS1/NS2) and structural (VP1/VP2) proteins was amplified and sequenced. On the basis of genetic analysis of the VP2 gene, the isolate was characterized as CPV\u20102c, but it presented genetic signatures typical of Asian strains. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of amino acid changes never observed in European CPV\u20102c strains (NS1: Ile60Val, Tyr544Phe, Glu545Val, Leu630Pro; VP2: Ala5Gly, Phe267Tyr, Tyr324Ile, Gln370Arg). By phylogenetic analysis of full\u2010length VP2 gene, the analysed strain clustered together with Asian viruses. Therefore, a possible introduction of the virus from Asia through the imported dog was suggested, thus confirming the important role of movement of dogs in the global spread of viruses. In addition, full\u2010length genome analysis could help better trace the spread of canine viruses through different continents.","publish_time":"2017-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mira, F.; Purpari, G.; Lorusso, E.; Di Bella, S.; Gucciardi, F.; Desario, C.; Macaluso, G.; Decaro, N.; Guercio, A.","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeebd51b3ae190ee2da47fd92dad70810398ca9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29134762/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12747","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV"],"locations":["Thailand","Asia"],"keyphrases":["CPV strain","full\u2010length genome analysis","phylogenetic analysis of full\u2010length VP2 gene","European CPV","Sequence analysis","Asian viruses","basis of genetic analysis","spread of canine viruses","NS1","c strains","global spread of viruses","imported dog","genetic signatures typical of Asian strains","analysed strain","Canine parvovirus","important role of movement","important infectious agent of domestic","wild carnivores","Ala5Gly","Leu630Pro","Glu545Val","Ile60Val","dogs","Tyr544Phe","presence of amino acid changes","Phe267Tyr","fatal haemorrhagic gastroenteritis","open reading frames","NS2","proteins","VP1","Tyr324Ile","genomic characterization","different continents","leukopenia","Gln370Arg","possible introduction","addition","isolate","paper","tissue samples","Italy","Thailand"],"language":"en"},

This study examines one source of growth patterns in asset prices by analyzing the integration relationship between stock markets and real estate markets in Asia. Six economies are selected for empirical analysis: China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Results show that stock markets are integrated with real estate markets in Japan, and partially integrated with real estate markets in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This implies that these two investment vehicles are substitutable in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan, and provide diversification potential for investment portfolios in South Korea and Singapore. Examining the timing of market changes, we found the real estate market leading the stock market in some countries, and the stock market leading the real estate market in others. We conclude that stock and real estate markets show a variety of inter-relationships depending on economic and political policy environments.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Tsoyu Calvin; Lin, Zong-Han","journal":"Pacific-Basin Finance Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60be6b2f04f740d19f083023d2027695664932df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927538X11000229; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927538X11000229","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","China","Hong Kong","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["real estate markets","stock markets","Hong Kong","China","Japan","Taiwan","timing of market changes","South Korea","Singapore","Abstract Rising asset prices","investment portfolios","investment vehicles","integration relationship","Asia\u0027s emerging economy","variety of inter-relationships","diversification potential","source of growth patterns","empirical analysis","political policy environments","countries","study","attention","economies","Results"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics in one of the cities and highlight the effect of current implemented lockdown and nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We retrieved data of reported cases in Huangshi and Wuhan from publicly available disease databases. Local epidemiological data on suspected or confirmed cases in Huangshi were collected through field investigation. Epidemic curves were constructed with data on reported and observed cases. RESULTS: The accumulated confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatality in Huangshi were reported to be 1015 and 3.74% respectively, compared with 50006 and 5.08% in Wuhan till Mar 27, 2020. Right after Jan 24, the epidemic curve based on observed cases in Huangshi became flattened. Feb 1, 2020 was identified as the \u201Cturning point\u201D as the epidemic in Huangshi faded soon afterwards. COVID-19 epidemic was characterized by mild cases in Huangshi, accounting for 82.66% of total cases. Moreover, 50 asymptomatic infections were identified in adults and children. Besides, we found confirmed cases in 19 familial clusters and 21 health care workers, supporting inter-human transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Huangshi city, China, across the unprecedented intervention. Such new epidemiological inference might provide further guidance on current lockdown measures in high-risk cities and, subsequently, help improve public health intervention strategies against the pandemic on the country and global levels.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Tuo; Chen, Hai-Lian; Xu, Jing; Wu, Ling-Ning; Li, Jie-Jia; Chen, Kai; Qin, Gang","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dce424e5d3fcb77c0b19575e6a846c500ed5610.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hubei","Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases","observed cases","data of reported cases","mild cases","total cases","Huangshi city","Epidemic curves","accumulated confirmed COVID","epidemiological characteristics","Local epidemiological data","current lockdown measures","high-risk cities","China sealed Wuhan","effect of current implemented lockdown","new epidemiological inference","public health intervention strategies","unprecedented intervention","health care workers","novel coronavirus disease","available disease databases","pandemic","guidance","help","familial clusters","accounting","inter-human transmission","nonpharmaceutical interventions","temporal dynamics","country","spread","study","fatality","adults","global levels","RESULTS","asymptomatic infections","Hubei province","field investigation","children","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","point","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

However, the precise underlying pathogenic mechanisms have not been elucidated. In the present study, the infectivity of RSV on N2a neuronal cells and the possible roles of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nucleolin (C23) during RSV infection were investigated. METHODS: We compared two experimental groups (infected and non-infected) and monitored the RSV viral titers in the culture supernatant by a viral plaque assay. We also inspected the morphology of the nucleus in infected N2a cells. We measured the level of RSV F protein and studied its co-localization with TLR4 and nucleolin using immunofluorescence assays and laser confocal microscopy. The potential interaction of RSV F protein with TLR4 and nucleolin was examined by coimmunoprecipitation. The expression changes of TLR4, nucleolin, TLR3 and TLR7 proteins in N2a cells and IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 in the culture supernatant were investigated by Western Blot analysis and ELISA assay. Changes in neuronal cell apoptosis status was examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The results demonstrated prolific RSV infection of N2a cells, which triggered a decrease of NeuN protein expression, coinciding with an increase of nuclear lesions, F protein expression, RSV viral titers, and late apoptotic levels of N2a cells. RSV infection induced co-localization of RSV F protein with TLR4 and nucleolin, which could potentially lead to a direct interaction. Furthermore, it was found that TLR4 and nucleolin levels increased early after infection and decreased subsequently, whereas TLR3 and TLR7 expression increased throughout RSV infection. CONCLUSION: The RSV Long strain can prolifically infect N2a neuronal cells, modulating the expression of TLR4 and nucleolin, as well as TLR3, TLR7 and their downstream inflammatory factors, and inducing the co-localization of the RSV F protein with TLR4 and nucleolin.","publish_time":"2018-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Xiaoling; Hu, Tao; He, Hanwen; Qiu, Huan; Wu, Xuan; Chen, Jingxian; Wang, Minmin; Chen, Cheng; Huang, Shenghai","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cb67b8103fed813182562e341dd55edb81c4998.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6389248.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427996/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-018-0416-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","RSV F","Western Blot","RSV Long"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectivity of RSV","expression of TLR4","level of RSV F protein","prolific RSV infection of N2a cells","co-localization of RSV F protein","RSV viral titers","potential interaction of RSV F protein","F protein expression","RSV Long strain","N2a neuronal cells","infected N2a cells","nucleolin levels","expression changes of TLR4","TLR7 expression","decrease of NeuN protein expression","late apoptotic levels of N2a cells","TLR3","culture supernatant","TLR7 proteins","viral plaque assay","RESULTS","neuronal cell apoptosis status","ELISA assay","direct interaction","immunofluorescence assays","IL","Western Blot analysis","possible roles of Toll","increase of nuclear lesions","central nervous system","experimental groups","receptor","laser confocal microscopy","downstream inflammatory factors","TNF-\u03B1","Respiratory syncytial virus","BACKGROUND","nucleus","C23","neurological symptoms","flow cytometry","precise underlying pathogenic mechanisms","present study","CONCLUSION","morphology","METHODS","coimmunoprecipitation"],"language":"en"},

Although antibodies remain the only natural host-derived defense mechanism capable of completely preventing infection, as products, they compete against inexpensive therapeutics such as antibiotics, small molecule inhibitors and active vaccines. The continued discovery in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) field of leads with broadened cross neutralization of viruses and demonstrable synergy of antibody with antibiotics for bacterial diseases, clearly show that innovation remains. The commercial success of mAbs in chronic disease has not been paralleled in infectious diseases for several reasons. Infectious disease immunotherapeutics are limited in scope as endemic diseases necessitate active vaccine development. Also, the complexity of these small markets draws the interest of niche companies rather than big pharmaceutical corporations. Lastly, the cost of goods for mAb therapeutics is inherently high for infectious agents due to the need for antibody cocktails, which better mimic polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations and prevent antigenic escape. In cases where vaccine or convalescent populations are available, current polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations (pIgG), with modern and highly efficient purification technology and standardized assays for potency, can make economic sense. Recent innovations to broaden the potency of mAb therapies, while reducing cost of production, are discussed herein. On the basis of centuries of effective use of Ab treatments, and with growing immunocompromised populations, the question is not whether antibodies have a bright future for infectious agents, but rather what formats are cost effective and generate safe and efficacious treatments to satisfy regulatory approval.","publish_time":"2011-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berry, Jody D.; Gaudet, Ryan G.","journal":"N Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bc69cf4c0bb5adcc8ec0797489ca9daf3dcfc69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21473942/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2011.03.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187167841100080X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187167841100080X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases","Antibody preparations","infectious agents","Infectious disease immunotherapeutics","mAb therapeutics","monoclonal antibody","antibody cocktails","endemic diseases","bacterial diseases","polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations","demonstrable synergy of antibody","antibiotics","potency of mAb therapies","antibodies","cost of goods","cost of production","current polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations","active vaccine development","efficacious treatments","convalescent populations","effective use of Ab treatments","inexpensive therapeutics","small markets","active vaccines","chronic disease","growing immunocompromised populations","small molecule inhibitors","broadened cross neutralization of viruses","field of leads","scope","pIgG","natural host-derived defense mechanism capable","efficient purification technology","niche companies","standardized assays","long history","big pharmaceutical corporations","infection","commercial success of mAbs","basis of centuries","question","antigenic escape","protection","bright future","formats","need","regulatory approval","continued discovery","products","cases","economic sense","Recent innovations","complexity","reasons"],"language":"en"},

As there is a paucity of evidence on which population is more likely to progress into severe conditions among cases, we looked into the first cluster of death cases, aiming to add to current evidence and reduce panic among the population. METHODS: We prospectively collected the demographic and clinical data of the first 38 fatalities whose information was made public by the Health Commission of Hubei province and the official Weibo account of China Central Television news center, starting from 9 January through 24 January 2020. The death cases were described from four aspects (gender and age characteristics, underlying diseases, the time course of death, symptoms at the incipience of illness and hospital admission). RESULTS: Among the 38 fatalities, 71.05% were male, and 28.95% were female, with the median age of 70 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 65-81). Persons aged 66-75 made up the largest share. Twenty-five cases had a history of chronic diseases. The median time between the first symptoms and death was 12.50 days (IQR = 10.00-16.25), while the median time between the admission and death was 8.50 (IQR = 5.00-12.00) days. In persons aged over 56 years, the time between the first symptoms and death decreased with age, and so did the time between the admission and death, though the latter increased again in persons aged over 85 years. The major first symptoms included fever (52.63%), cough (31.58%), dyspnea (23.68%), myalgia and fatigue (15.79%). CONCLUSIONS: Among the death cases, persons with underlying diseases and aged over 65 made up the majority. The time between the first symptoms and death decreased with the advanced age. In all the age groups, males dominated the fatalities.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yifei; Zhao, Meizhen; Wu, Yifan; Zang, Shuang","journal":"Journal of global health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac00e691678dbb45ff0f15d3b3afd09081a4e7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373340/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh-10-011004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["time course of death","cluster of death cases","symptoms","median time","median age","fast-growing death toll","Persons","age characteristics","age groups","advanced age","fatalities","IQR","years","underlying diseases","Hubei province of China","hospital admission","population","days","history of chronic diseases","Health Commission of Hubei province","severe conditions","current evidence","paucity of evidence","severe acute respiratory syndrome","official Weibo account of China Central Television news center","SARS","COVID","gender","aspects","incipience of illness","interquartile range","emergence of coronavirus disease","demographic","clinical data","information","panic","fever","males","female","myalgia","dyspnea","globe","cough","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","largest share","fatigue","way","METHODS","months","RESULTS","majority"],"language":"en"},

For patients with osteonecrosis of both the hip and knee joints or for patients with a history of corticosteroid use or alcohol abuse who had osteonecrosis of one or more joints in the shoulder, ankle, wrist or elbow, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed on other joints, regardless of whether these joints were symptomatic. Furthermore, we performed a radiological screening of 102 patients who had a negative diagnosis of MFON but were at a high risk; among them, another 31 MFON cases were successfully identified (30.4%). Thus, the incidence of MFON during the study period increased from 3.1% to 5.2%.

The new virus was called Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). Three weeks later, the World Health Organization declared that 2019-nCoV was capable of direct human-to-human transmission, the virus had spread across several countries in three continents, and had infected close to two thousand people, of whom at least 1 in 5 quite severely. The number of fatalities was fast rising. Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov. It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.

We studied 878 stool specimens from children with acute gastroenteritis and 112 controls (43 children with unspecified fever, 33 with respiratory tract infection and 36 healthy children) for known HBoVs. The same specimens were previously studied for rotaviruses, noroviruses, sapoviruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses and aichivirus. Methods: HBoVs were detected by PCR and positive amplicons were sequenced to identify HBoV1, HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4. Results: HBoV of any type was found in 85 (9.7%) cases of acute gastroenteritis and in 6 (5.4%) controls. HBoV1 was detected in 49 (5.6%) cases and 2 (1.8%) controls, HBoV2 in 29 (3.3%) cases and 2 (1.8%) controls and HBoV3 in 8 (0.9%) cases and 2 (1.8%) controls. No HBoV4 was found. HBoV as a single infection was found in 16 (1.8%) cases and in 6 (5.4%) controls; in the remaining cases, a known gastroenteritis virus was also found. Among the single HBoV infections, HBoV2 was the most common type with 8 (50%) cases. Conclusion: HBoVs are rarely found alone in children with acute gastroenteritis. Further studies are warranted to confirm a possible specific association of HBoV2 with gastroenteritis.","publish_time":"2012-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Risku, Minna; K\u00E4tk\u00E4, Minna; Lappalainen, Suvi; R\u00E4s\u00E4nen, Sirpa; Vesikari, Timo","journal":"Acta Paediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a52ffba79550d7b2fb3042f7e22c2ca8ea7b91c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159669.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02727.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22568605/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["controls","cases of acute gastroenteritis","remaining cases","healthy children","known gastroenteritis virus","known HBoVs","single HBoV infections","single infection","HBoV1","HBoV3","HBoV4","possible specific association of HBoV2","stool specimens","common type","respiratory tract infection","unspecified fever","sapoviruses","adenoviruses","coronaviruses","noroviruses","rotaviruses","PCR","positive amplicons","aichivirus","human bocavirus","types","Methods","Results","studies","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

A rapid and highly sensitive detection and quantification method for TSV and YHV was developed using the GeneAmp(\u00AE) 5700 Sequence Detection System and SYBR Green chemistry. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mixture contained a fluorescent dye, SYBR Green, which exhibits fluorescence enhancement upon binding to double strand cDNA. The enhancement of fluorescence was found to be proportional to the initial concentration of the template cDNA. A linear relationship was observed between input plasmid DNA and cycle threshold (C(T)) values for 10(6) down to a single copy of both viruses. To control for the variation in sample processing and in reverse transcription reaction among samples, shrimp \u03B2-actin and elongation factor-1\u03B1 (EF-1\u03B1) genes were amplified in parallel with the viral cDNA. The sensitivity and the efficiency of amplification of EF-1\u03B1 was greater than \u03B2-actin when compared to TSV and YHV amplification efficiency suggesting that EF-1\u03B1 is a better internal control for the RT-PCR detection of TSV and YHV. In addition, sample to sample variation in EF-1\u03B1 C(T) value was lower than the variation in \u03B2-actin C(T) value of the corresponding samples. The specificity of TSV, YHV, EF-1\u03B1 and \u03B2-actin amplifications was confirmed by analyzing the dissociation curves of the target amplicon. The C(T) values of TSV and YHV samples were normalized against EF-1\u03B1 C(T) values for determining the absolute copy number from the standard curve of the corresponding virus. The method described here is highly robust and is amenable to high throughput assays making it a useful tool for diagnostic, epidemiological and genetic studies in shrimp aquaculture.","publish_time":"2002-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhar, Arun K.; Roux, Michelle M.; Klimpel, Kurt R.","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2394f46086f9125174094bc1ca712cdbd404ce16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173102.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093402000423; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093402000423","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TSV","YHV","Detection System","SYBR Green"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B1 C","values of TSV","YHV samples","\u03B2-actin C","shrimp \u03B2-actin","specificity of TSV","YHV amplification efficiency","RT-PCR detection of TSV","\u03B2-actin amplifications","sample variation","shrimp aquaculture","penaeid shrimp","corresponding samples","corresponding virus","sensitive detection","sample processing","fluorescence enhancement","enhancement of fluorescence","efficiency of amplification","template cDNA","viral cDNA","reverse transcription reaction","Sequence Detection System","SYBR Green chemistry","yellow head virus","double strand cDNA","Taura syndrome virus","RNA viruses","quantification method","single copy","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","absolute copy number","better internal control","input plasmid DNA","useful tool","standard curve","mixture","cycle threshold","elongation factor","genetic studies","high throughput assays","diagnostic","Penaeus","fluorescent dye","binding","initial concentration","dissociation curves","linear relationship","major economic losses","target amplicon","GeneAmp","addition","genes","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Mathematical models of the actual and potential spread of specific pathogens can assist public health planning in the case of such an event. Models should generally be parsimonious, but must consider all potentially important components of the system to the greatest extent possible. We demonstrate and discuss important assumptions relative to the parameterization and structural treatment of airline travel in mathematical models. Among other findings, we show that the most common structural treatment of travelers leads to underestimation of the speed of spread and that connecting travel is critical to a realistic spread pattern. Models involving travelers can be improved significantly by relatively simple structural changes but also may require further attention to details of parameterization.","publish_time":"2011-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johansson, Michael A.; Arana-Vizcarrondo, Neysar\u00ED; Biggerstaff, Brad J.; Staples, J.

Infections during lymphopenia after allogeneic HSCT are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Typical infectious agents are Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella\u2010zoster virus and fungi. The study aim was to evaluate whether measurement of the responses of antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells, recognizing infectious pathogens would correlate to protective functions in the stem cell recipient post\u2010transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty\u2010one grafts were analysed by flow cytometry and cells were stimulated in vitro with relevant infectious antigens, followed by evaluation of T\u2010cell proliferation and cytokine production. Results were compared to the recipients\u2019 clinical records 1\u2010year post\u2010transplantation. RESULTS: We show that an extensive repertoire of transferred antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells from allogeneic donor grafts against infectious agents, involved in post\u2010transplant infections, are linked to an absence of infectious complications for the recipient up\u2010to 1\u2010year post\u2010transplant. The protective effect was associated with antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell proliferation and IL\u20101\u03B2 secretion.

We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK\u0027s world-leading infrastructure. This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holmes, Emily A; O\u0027Connor, Rory C; Perry, V Hugh; Tracey, Irene; Wessely, Simon; Arseneault, Louise; Ballard, Clive; Christensen, Helen; Cohen Silver, Roxane; Everall, Ian; Ford, Tamsin; John, Ann; Kabir, Thomas; King, Kate; Madan, Ira; Michie, Susan; Przybylski, Andrew K; Shafran, Roz; Sweeney, Angela; Worthman, Carol M; Yardley, Lucy; Cowan, Katherine; Cope, Claire; Hotopf, Matthew; Bullmore, Ed","journal":"Lancet Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/108ad10767769ef34ac5aec1a972b7597f6335d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159850.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(20)30168-1; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036620301681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304649/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2215036620301681","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK Academy of Medical Sciences","UK","Position Paper"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mental health effects","mental health research charity","mental health science research","mental health consequences","mental health of patients","research priorities","health messaging","physical health","research efforts","high-quality research standards","UK research funding agencies","neuroscientific effects of COVID","pandemic conditions","immediate priorities","vulnerable groups","neuroscientific aspects","people","lived experience","New funding","high-quality data","aspects of society","UK Academy of Medical Sciences","immediate priority","urgent need","new ones","longer-term strategies","researchers","impact of repeated media consumption","MQ","brain function","cognition","expert panel","global perspective","refinement","driven interventions","profound effect","high level coordination group","weeks","integration","disciplines","UK\u0027s world-leading infrastructure","evaluation","International collaboration","surveys","population","Position Paper","strategy","challenge","sectors","Discovery","time","coronavirus disease","countries"],"language":"en"},

Better understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the development and evaluation of effective control policies. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts. The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020. All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test. The final follow-up date was April 2, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care). RESULTS: We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 56 men and 44 women. Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired index-secondary cases. The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%). The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%). The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]). The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings. The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Jian, Shu-Wan; Liu, Ding-Ping; Ng, Ta-Chou; Huang, Wan-Ting; Lin, Hsien-Ho","journal":"JAMA Internal Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356867/; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/articlepdf/2765641/jamainternal_cheng_2020_oi_200031.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","index cases","family contacts","close contacts","symptomatic cases","years","transmission dynamics of COVID","paired index-secondary cases","attack rates","overall secondary clinical attack rate","different exposure settings","high transmissibility of COVID","days of symptom onset","different exposure window periods","different exposure time windows","transmission risk","study period","health care","symptomatic patients","confirmed patients","prospective case-ascertained study","dynamics of coronavirus disease","relevant symptoms","respiratory symptoms","generalized measures","quarantine period","development","Taiwan","PARTICIPANTS","fever","cough","median age","laboratory","MAIN OUTCOMES","evaluation of effective control policies","exclusive presymptomatic exposures","range","Better understanding","RELEVANCE","IMPORTANCE","home","final follow-up date","DESIGN","epidemic","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","test","social distancing","women","nonhousehold"],"language":"en"},

In order to understand the efficacy and safety of this approach, it is important to know the antibody specificities generated with inactivated SARS-CoV. In the current study, a panel of twelve monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was established by immunizing Balb/c mice with the inactivated BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV isolated from the lung tissue of a SARS-infected Chinese patient. These mAbs could recognize SARS-CoV-infected cells by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). Seven of them were mapped to the specific segments of recombinant spike (S) protein: six on S1 subunit (aa 12\u2013798) and one on S2 subunit (aa 797\u20131192). High neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV were detected with two mAbs (1A5 and 2C5) targeting at a subdomain of S protein (aa 310\u2013535), consistent with the previous report that this segment of S protein contains the major neutralizing domain. Some of these S-specific mAbs were able to recognize cleaved products of S protein in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. None of the remaining five mAbs could recognize either of the recombinant S, N, M, or E antigens by ELISA. This study demonstrated that the inactivated SARS-CoV was able to preserve the immunogenicity of S protein including its major neutralizing domain. The relative ease with which these mAbs were generated against SARS-CoV virions further supports that subunit vaccination with S constructs may also be able to protect animals and perhaps humans. It is somewhat unexpected that no N-specific mAbs were identified albeit anti-N IgG was easily identified in SARS-CoV-infected patients. The availability of this panel of mAbs also provided potentially useful agents with applications in therapy, diagnosis, and basic research of SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2005-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chou, Te-hui W.; Wang, Shixia; Sakhatskyy, Pavlo V.; Mboudoudjeck, Innocent; Lawrence, John M.; Huang, Song; Coley, Scott; Yang, Baoan; Li, Jiaming; Zhu, Qingyu; Lu, Shan","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f78ed5ca7174f13d3789f9a80e615933c370a75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111783.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205000681; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205000681","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivated SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV virions","re-emergence of SARS","S-specific mAbs","panel of mAbs","segment of S protein","immunogenicity of S protein","subdomain of S protein","basic research of SARS","N-specific mAbs","inactivated BJ01 strain of SARS","S constructs","SARS-infected Chinese patient","cleaved products of S protein","infected cells","infected patients","major neutralizing domain","infected Vero E6 cells","subunit vaccination","S1 subunit","S2 subunit","specific segments of recombinant spike","anti-N IgG","High neutralizing titers","current study","Abstract Inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","therapy","c mice","diagnosis","useful agents","immunofluorescence analysis","lung tissue","immunizing Balb","previous report","antibody specificities","applications","IFA","monoclonal antibodies","efficacy","safety","approach","E antigens","2C5","candidate vaccine","order","ELISA","animals","humans","relative ease","1A5","availability"],"language":"en"},

The patients referred for SARS assessment were analysed from a public health perspective. None of the patients referred had SARS, based on serological and virological criteria. Nevertheless, all 72 patients required thorough assessment and, depending on the results of the assessment, institution of appropriate prevention and control measures. Changing case definitions caused confusion in classifying cases. A centralised assessment of the reported cases by a team with clinical and public health expertise (epidemiological and geographical risk assessment) is a practical solution for addressing differences in applying case definitions.

This study aims to examine the burden of disease in Korea as of 2015, and to study how the burden of disease changes with the passage of time. METHODS: We used results from the Korean National Burden of Disease and Injuries Study 2015 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by gender and age groups from 2007 to 2015. DALYs were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost (YLLs) and the years lived with disability (YLDs). RESULTS: In 2015, the burden of disease for Korean people was calculated at 29,476 DALYs per 100,000 population. DALYs caused by low back pain were the highest, followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The burden of disease showed a consistently increasing trend from 2007 to 2015. Although YLLs have been on the decrease since 2011, the increase in YLDs has contributed to the overall rise in DALYs. The DALYs per 100,000 population in 2015 increased by 28.1% compared to 2007. CONCLUSION: As for the diseases for which the burden of disease is substantially increasing, it is needed to establish appropriate policies in a timely manner. The results of this study are expected to be the basis for prioritizing public health and health care policies in Korea.","publish_time":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Young-Eun; Park, Hyesook; Jo, Min-Woo; Oh, In-Hwan; Go, Dun-Sol; Jung, Jaehun; Yoon, Seok-Jun","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e18ac727e1edc13aeab67e5d458ee00a190ace7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6434149.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923488/; https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e75","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DALYs","burden of disease changes","Korean National Burden of Disease","non-fatal disease burden","results","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","view of population health","public health","Injuries Study","years of life","health care policies","health-sector leaders","disability-adjusted life years","YLDs","YLLs","cause-specific mortality","all-cause mortality","Korean people","appropriate policies","decision makers","useful information","diabetes mellitus","researchers","gender","basis","informed citizens","passage of time","timely manner","pain","age groups","overall rise","sum","diseases","decrease","increase","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS","trend"],"language":"en"},

We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS. Methods We tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens. We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection. Findings SARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically. SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS. The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection. Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia. SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. Interpretation Replication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.

Whereas the variability of virulence among reservoir-borne viruses is unknown, it is generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs requires human adaptation. To understand the influence of a viral factor in relation to interspecies spillover, we studied the papain-like protease (PLP) of SARS-CoV. This key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cleaves the viral polyprotein, deubiquitinates viral and cellular proteins, and antagonizes the interferon (IFN) response. We identified a bat SARS-CoV PLP, which shared 86% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV PLP, and used reverse genetics to insert it into the SARS-CoV genome. The resulting virus replicated like SARS-CoV in Vero cells but was suppressed in IFN competent MA-104 (3.7-fold), Calu-3 (2.6-fold) and human airway epithelial cells (10.3-fold). Using ectopically-expressed PLP variants as well as full SARS-CoV infectious clones chimerized for PLP, we found that a protease-independent, anti-IFN function exists in SARS-CoV, but not in a SARS-related, bat-borne virus. This PLP-mediated anti-IFN difference was seen in primate, human as well as bat cells, thus independent of the host context. The results of this study revealed that coronavirus PLP confers a variable virulence trait among members of the species SARS-CoV, and that a SARS-CoV lineage with virulent PLPs may have pre-existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niemeyer, Daniela; M\u00F6sbauer, Kirstin; Klein, Eva M.; Sieberg, Andrea; Mettelman, Robert C.; Mielech, Anna M.; Dijkman, Ronald; Baker, Susan C.; Drosten, Christian; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6171950.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat SARS-CoV PLP","species SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV lineage","SARS-CoV genome","SARS-coronavirus","SARS-related","plethora of SARS","SARS-CoV infectious clones","coronavirus PLP","PLP variants","bat cells","fold","viral polyprotein","viral factor","deubiquitinates viral","anti-IFN function","anti-IFN difference","conspecific viral lineages","human airway epithelial cells","Vero cells","human adaptation","protease-independent","IFN competent MA","emergence of epidemic viruses","variability of virulence","resulting virus","variable virulence trait","animal reservoirs","members","cellular proteins","relation","interspecies spillover","primate","amino acid identity","zoonotic agent","early stages of infection","virulent PLPs","rhinolophid bats","interferon","papain","key enzyme","reverse genetics","influence","study","host context","results","response","onset","Calu"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the acceptability and compliance with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine among HCWs during the current campaign. Between 23 December 2009 and 13 January 2010, once the workplace vaccination program was over, we conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain). Five hundred twenty-seven HCWs were asked about their influenza immunization history during the 2009\u20132010 season, as well as the reasons for accepting or declining either the seasonal or pandemic vaccines. Multiple logistic-regression analysis was preformed to identify variables associated with immunization acceptance.

They exist in both endogenous and exogenous forms and are implicated in animal diseases such as lung cancer in sheep, and in human disease, with members of the human endogenous retrovirus-K (HERV-K) group of endogenous betaretroviruses (\u03B2ERVs) associated with human cancers and autoimmune diseases. To improve our understanding of betaretroviruses in an evolutionarily distinct host species, we characterized \u03B2ERVs present in the genomes and transcriptomes of mega- and microbats, which are an important reservoir of emerging viruses. RESULTS: A diverse range of full-length \u03B2ERVs were discovered in mega- and microbat genomes and transcriptomes including the first identified intact endogenous retrovirus in a bat. Our analysis revealed that the genus Betaretrovirus can be divided into eight distinct sub-groups with evidence of cross-species transmission. Betaretroviruses are revealed to be a complex retrovirus group, within which one sub-group has evolved from complex to simple genomic organization through the acquisition of an env gene from the genus Gammaretrovirus. Molecular dating suggests that bats have contended with betaretroviral infections for over 30 million years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that a diverse range of betaretroviruses have circulated in bats for most of their evolutionary history, and cluster with extant betaretroviruses of divergent mammalian lineages suggesting that their distribution may be largely unrestricted by host species barriers. The presence of \u03B2ERVs with the ability to transcribe active viral elements in a major animal reservoir for viral pathogens has potential implications for public health.","publish_time":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayward, Joshua A; Tachedjian, Mary; Cui, Jie; Field, Hume; Holmes, Edward C; Wang, Lin-Fa; Tachedjian, Gilda","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b810552f81fc62a9f69f64033011fd5c627c8ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3621094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23537098/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-10-35","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group of endogenous betaretroviruses","diverse range of betaretroviruses","understanding of betaretroviruses","human endogenous retrovirus","wide range of species","distinct host species","complex retrovirus group","\u03B2ERVs present","diverse range of full-length \u03B2ERVs","species transmission","presence of \u03B2ERVs","host species barriers","animal diseases","extant betaretroviruses of divergent mammalian lineages","human disease","human cancers","transcriptomes of mega-","major animal reservoir","distinct sub-groups","viral pathogens","microbat genomes","autoimmune diseases","genus Gammaretrovirus","genus Betaretrovirus","active viral elements","important reservoir of emerging viruses","potential implications","cluster","evidence of cross","acquisition","distribution","sheep","ability","rodents","primates","microbats","members","HERV","simple genomic organization","public health","env gene","evolutionary history","lung cancer","ruminants","exogenous forms","betaretroviral infections","study","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","years","marsupials","analysis","Molecular dating","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to predict mild and severe cases of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 140 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 12, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to disease severity: a mild group (MG) (n = 107) and a severe group (SG) (n = 33). Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients, the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased in 95 (67.9 %), 91 (65.0 %), and 8 (5.7 %) patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG. Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with IL-6 \u003E 32.1 pg/mL or CRP \u003E 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications. CONCLUSION: The serum levels of IL-6 and CRP can effectively assess disease severity and predict outcome in patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Fang; Li, Lin; Xu, MengDa; Wu, Juan; Luo, Ding; Zhu, YuSi; Li, BiXi; Song, XiaoYang; Zhou, Xiang","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a765029b393edafe3308b30dbea068e84a727f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344321/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301128; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104370; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301128","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CRP","severity of COVID","increased IL","serum levels of IL","PCT levels","disease severity","proportion of patients","severe cases of COVID","severe group","coronavirus disease","STUDY DESIGN","mild group","study population","SG","severe complications","admission","retrospective cohort study","demographic characteristics","inflammatory response","baseline clinical characteristics","inflammatory cytokine storm","critical role","Cox proportional hazard model","Data","groups","procalcitonin","outcome","C-reactive protein","independent factors","CONCLUSION","ability of interleukin","BACKGROUND","pg","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, the RdRp resides in a replicase subunit that is unusually large. Bioinformatics analysis of this non-structural protein has now revealed a nidoviral signature domain (genetic marker) that is N-terminally adjacent to the RdRp and has no apparent homologs elsewhere. Based on its conservation profile, this domain is proposed to have nucleotidylation activity. We used recombinant non-structural protein 9 of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) and different biochemical assays, including irreversible labeling with a GTP analog followed by a proteomics analysis, to demonstrate the manganese-dependent covalent binding of guanosine and uridine phosphates to a lysine/histidine residue. Most likely this was the invariant lysine of the newly identified domain, named nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), whose substitution with alanine severely diminished the described binding. Furthermore, this mutation crippled EAV and prevented the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cell culture, indicating that NiRAN is essential for nidoviruses. Potential functions supported by NiRAN may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis, possibilities that remain to be explored in future studies.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehmann, Kathleen C.; Gulyaeva, Anastasia; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Janssen, George M.

We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Duc Duy; Gao, Kaifu; Chen, Jiahui; Wang, Rui; Wei, Guo-Wei","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0aff00101d5ccc6592987185ab833f95d842f98b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/48e80ed68569a2ff09e3e8af4817b2221ac6bb27.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.936013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS","SBDR","U.S. Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS","nCoV medication","protease X-ray crystal structure","protease inhibitors","structural-based drug repositioning","FDA approved drugs","D homology structure","SBDR model","Drug Administration","global health emergency","World Health Organization","infection","existing experimental datasets","machine learning","sound foundation","mathematics","proteases","Food","novel coronavirus","sequence identity","DrugBank"],"language":"en"},

We examined the relations between the level and decrease of temperature, humidity and the risk of influenza A and B virus infections in a subarctic climate. METHODS: We conducted a case-crossover study among military conscripts (n = 892) seeking medical attention due to respiratory symptoms during their military training period and identified 66 influenza A and B cases by PCR or serology. Meteorological data such as measures of average and decline in ambient temperature and absolute humidity (AH) during the three preceding days of the onset (hazard period) and two reference periods, prior and after the onset were obtained. RESULTS: The average temperature preceding the influenza onset was \u22126.8 \u00B1 5.6\u00B0C and AH 3.1 \u00B1 1.3 g/m(3). A decrease in both temperature and AH during the hazard period increased the occurrence of influenza so that a 1\u00B0C decrease in temperature and 0.5 g decrease per m(3) in AH increased the estimated risk by 11% [OR 1.11 (1.03 to 1.20)] and 58% [OR 1.58 (1.28 to 1.96)], respectively. The occurrence of influenza infections was positively associated with both the average temperature [OR 1.10 per 1\u00B0C (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.19)] and AH [OR 1.25 per g/m(3) (1.05 to 1.49)] during the hazard period prior to onset. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that a decrease rather than low temperature and humidity per se during the preceding three days increase the risk of influenza episodes in a cold climate.","publish_time":"2014-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaakkola, Kari; Saukkoriipi, Annika; Jokelainen, Jari; Juvonen, Raija; Kauppila, Jaana; Vainio, Olli; Ziegler, Thedi; R\u00F6nkk\u00F6, Esa; Jaakkola, Jouni JK; Ik\u00E4heimo, Tiina M","journal":"Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b8c0be4a3bed5dbeea46401dcebe6c1263ead10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3978084.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-069x-13-22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza onset","average temperature","AH","risk of influenza infections","ambient temperature","low temperature","risk of influenza episodes","occurrence of influenza infections","C decrease","hazard period","absolute humidity","preceding days","estimated risk","military training period","B virus infections","RESULTS","military conscripts","B cases","subarctic climate","cold climate","respiratory symptoms","case-crossover study","reference periods","medical attention","PCR","serology","level","confidence interval","Meteorological data","BACKGROUND","relations","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In this study, 211 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 25 farms across six provinces in China, between November 2017 and September 2018. 20.4% of the samples were detected as BNoV-positive by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on RdRp, VP1, and VP2 fragments revealed these BNoV strains had unique evolutionary characteristics. The complete genome of strain Bo/BET\u201317/18/CH was successfully sequenced. It was 7321 nucleotides (nt) in length, shared 79.4\u201380.9% nt identity with all five BNoV genomes, clustered on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that strain Bo/BET\u201317/18/CH could represent a novel BNoV strain.

Moreover 16.3% (7/43) of the BNoV were identified as the novel VP1 genotype, which were distributed on four farms across two provinces, indicating that the novel VP1 genotype strain has spread.

Neopterin levels predict HIV-related mortality more efficiently than clinical manifestations. Successful highly active antiretroviral therapy is associated with a decrease in neopterin levels. Elevated neopterin levels were associated with hepatitis by hepatitis A, B, and C viruses.

The rapidity of CNS remyelination is critical since it not only restores fast conduction of nerve impulses but also maintains axon integrity. If myelin repair fails, axons degenerate, leading to increased disability. In the human CNS demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS), remyelination often takes place in the midst of inflammation. Here, we discuss recent studies that address the innate repair capabilities of the axon-glia unit from fish to man. We propose that expansion of this research field will help find ways to maintain or enhance spontaneous remyelination in man.","publish_time":"2008-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dubois-Dalcq, Monique; Williams, Anna; Stadelmann, Christine; Stankoff, Bruno; Zalc, Bernard; Lubetzki, Catherine","journal":"Brain","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3543631ec1f038a910259208b6616231c2d72286.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2516372.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awn076; https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-pdf/131/7/1686/1086435/awn076.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18474520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rapidity of CNS remyelination","spontaneous remyelination","adult fish CNS","human CNS demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis","axonal regeneration","myelin repair","axon integrity","innate repair capabilities","axon-glia unit","efficient programmes of regeneration","MS","axons degenerate","capability","neurite regrowth","evolutionary pressure","fast conduction of nerve impulses","ways","place","central nervous system","recent studies","research field","increased disability","contrast","midst of inflammation","expansion"],"language":"en"},

CD46 is another co-stimulatory receptor that promotes differentiation of CD4\u002B T-helper cells type 1 (Th1 cells) into a regulatory phenotype with a switch from IFN-\u03B3 towards IL-10-secretion over time. Whether CD46 exerts a similar function on CD8\u002B T cells remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that CD46 co-stimulation induced secretion of IFN-\u03B3 as well as expansion of IFN-\u03B3-secreting CD8\u002B T cells. In contrast to CD46 co-stimulation of CD4\u002B T cells, CD8\u002B T cells did not differentiate into a regulatory IL-10-secreting phenotype.

Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading.

Despite existing widespread digital surveillance and major potential community benefits of extending its use to communicable disease control, there is considerable public disquiet about allowing public health authorities access to personal health data.

In this perspective piece, we draw from the response to the 2014 Ebola and 2015 Zika epidemics to review examples whereby CHWs contributed to health security and pandemic preparedness. CHWs promoted pandemic preparedness prior to the epidemics by increasing the access to health services and products within communities, communicating health concepts in a culturally appropriate fashion, and reducing the burdens felt by formal healthcare systems. During the epidemics, CHWs promoted pandemic preparedness by acting as community-level educators and mobilizers, contributing to surveillance systems, and filling health service gaps. Acknowledging the success CHWs have had in these roles and in previous interventions, we propose that the cadre may be better engaged in pandemic preparedness in the future. Some practical strategies for achieving this include training and using CHWs to communicate One Health information to at-risk communities prior to outbreaks, pooling them into a reserve health corps to be used during public health emergencies, and formalizing agreements and strategies to promote the early engagement of CHWs in response actions. Recognizing that CHWs already play a role in pandemic preparedness, we feel that expanding the roles and responsibilities of CHWs represents a practical means of improving pandemic and community-level resilience.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyce, Matthew R.; Katz, Rebecca","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/897261feca5f934f8a39599d294f9147941bfcad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6443984.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972316/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic preparedness","health systems","health concepts","Health information","health security","health services","responsibilities of CHWs","success CHWs","public health emergencies","reserve health corps","early engagement of CHWs","importance of community health workers","filling health service gaps","surveillance systems","community-level educators","community-level resilience","Zika epidemics","practical strategies","roles","formal healthcare systems","at-risk communities","practical means","response actions","products","formalizing agreements","burdens","outbreaks","mobilizers","examples","resource-constrained environments","appropriate fashion","access","Ebola","training","previous interventions","cadre","contributions","future","perspective piece"],"language":"en"},

The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2\u002B was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI \u2192 RF \u2192 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel. The replication complex was still active after treatment with nonionic detergent, but no labeled 44 S RNA was detected in gels, even in the presence of RNasin in the assay which inhibited some nuclease activity. Antibodies to flavivirus-specific nonstructural proteins were preincubated with infected cell extracts in the presence and absence of detergent but no inhibition of RDRP activity was observed.

The present study aimed to assess the safety of S DEL5/ORF3 and to evaluate its effectiveness as a live vaccine for prime-booster vaccinations. Reversion to virulence experiments revealed that the S DEL5/ORF3 strain retains its attenuated phenotype and genetic stability after five successive passages in susceptible piglets. Pregnant sows were primed orally with an S DEL5/ORF3 live vaccine and boosted intramuscularly twice with a commercial killed vaccine at 2-week intervals prior to parturition. This sow vaccination regimen completely protected nursing piglets against virulent G2b challenge, as evidenced by the increase in survival rate from 0% to 100% and the significant reduction in diarrhea intensity, including the amount and duration of PEDV fecal shedding. In addition, despite a 2\u20133 day period of weight loss in piglets from vaccinated sows after challenge, their daily weight gain was recovered at 7 days post-challenge and became similar to that of unchallenged pigs from unvaccinated sows over the course of the experiment. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were verified in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows with the prime-boost treatment and their offspring. Altogether, our data demonstrated that the attenuated S DEL5/ORF3 strain guarantees the safety to host animals with no reversion to virulence and is suitable as an effective primary live vaccine providing durable maternal lactogenic immunity for passive piglet protection.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jang, Guehwan; Won, Hokeun; Lee, Dong-Uk; Noh, Yun-Hee; Lee, Seung-Chul; Choi, Hwan-Won; Yoon, In-Joong; Lee, Yoo Jin; Sang Yoo, Han; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4605351a6f163494f4d470cbc57eb2194af2ca1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117296.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519301300; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955799/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519301300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated S DEL5","ORF3 live vaccine","safety of S DEL5","ORF3 virus","ORF3 strain","unvaccinated sows","Pregnant sows","virulent G2b challenge","effective primary live vaccine","susceptible piglets","attenuated phenotype","colostrum of immunized sows","commercial killed vaccine","attenuated KNU","Reversion","protected nursing piglets","virulent G2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","days post-challenge","diarrhea intensity","duration of PEDV fecal shedding","virulence experiments","daily weight gain","prime-boost treatment","prime-booster vaccinations","day period of weight loss","durable maternal lactogenic immunity","continuous propagation","genetic stability","passive piglet protection","successive passages","sow vaccination regimen","week intervals","unchallenged pigs","course","sera","animals","effectiveness","Vero cells","significant reduction","offspring","increase","strong antibody responses","data","survival rate","parturition","present study","generation","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We prospectively collected and analyzed the clinical features, laboratory data and outcomes of 7 newborns delivered by SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University during January 20 to January 29, 2020. RESULTS: 4 of the 7 newborns were late preterm with gestational age between 36 weeks and 37 weeks, and the other 3 were full-term infants. The average birth weight was 2096 \u00B1 660 g. All newborns were born without asphyxia. 2 premature infants performed mild grunting after birth, but relieved rapidly with non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) ventilation. 3 cases had chest X-ray, 1 was normal and 2 who were supported by nCPAP presented mild neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Samples of pharyngeal swab in 6 cases, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood in 4 cases were tested by qRT-PCR, and there was no positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in all cases.

We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I 2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12\u00B72 years (SD 4\u00B71) to 68\u00B70 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27\u00B79%; 95% CI 20\u00B75\u201336\u00B70] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32\u00B76%; 24\u00B77\u201340\u00B79] of 129), anxiety (46 [35\u00B77%; 27\u00B76\u201344\u00B72] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34\u00B71%; 26\u00B72\u201342\u00B75] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41\u00B79%; 22\u00B75\u201350\u00B75] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0\u00B77%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10\u00B75%; 95% CI 7\u00B75\u201314\u00B71] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12\u00B71%; 8\u00B76\u201316\u00B73] of 280), anxiety (21 [12\u00B73%; 7\u00B77\u201317\u00B77] of 171), irritability (28 [12\u00B78%; 8\u00B77\u201317\u00B76] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18\u00B79%; 14\u00B71\u201324\u00B72] of 233), fatigue (61 [19\u00B73%; 15\u00B71\u201323\u00B79] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30\u00B74%; 23\u00B79\u201337\u00B73] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100\u00B70%; 88\u00B70\u2013100\u00B70] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32\u00B72% (95% CI 23\u00B77\u201342\u00B70; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14\u00B79% (12\u00B71\u201318\u00B72; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14\u00B78% (11\u00B71\u201319\u00B74; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76\u00B79%; 95% CI 68\u00B71\u201384\u00B76) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35\u00B73 months (SD 40\u00B71). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

Convalescent plasma (CP) constitutes the first option in the current situation, since it has been successfully used in other coronaviruses outbreaks. Herein, we discuss the possible mechanisms of action of CP and their repercussion in COVID-19 pathogenesis, including direct neutralization of the virus, control of an overactive immune system (i.e., cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, complement activation) and immunomodulation of a hypercoagulable state. All these benefits of PC are expected to be better achieved if used in non-critically hospitalized patients, in the hope of reducing morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rojas, Manuel; Rodriguez, Yhojan; Monsalve, Diana M.; Acosta-Ampudia, Yeny; Camacho, Bernardo; Gallo, Juan Esteban; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana; Ram\u00EDrez-Santana, Carolina; D\u00EDaz-Coronado, Juan C.; Manrique, Rub\u00E9n; Mantilla, Ruben D.; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Anaya, Juan-Manuel","journal":"Autoimmun Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d338031769b347b3dda279396fee1e820bbb39e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198427.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997220301166?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102554; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568997220301166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CP","COVID","current pandemic","Therapeutic options","coronavirus disease","current situation","old therapeutic tools","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cytokine storm","control","Th17 ratio","overactive immune system","antibiotics","activation","antimalarials","antivirals","attention","direct neutralization","SARS-CoV","hope","immunomodulation","vaccines","pathogenesis","infectious diseases","repercussion","possible mechanisms of action","hospitalized patients","hypercoagulable state","morbidity","mortality","study","Convalescent plasma","coronaviruses outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

To carry out our reflection, we will base on a psychological listening experience (in a psychoanalytic orientation) conducted during the Nice attacks in 2016, and continued today, during the current pandemic context. More specifically, we will look at the signifier \u0022victim\u0022, including all that it involves as questions about the subject. Our proposal will be to consider the victim status as a crossing. During this one, it is important that the suffering of the subjects is listened to, recognized, judged and compensated. And this, in order that everyone can find his own way of giving an answer to the reality of the virus, as it has imposed itself on us. But we will also see that one of the possible conclusions of this crossing consists in going through various forms of sublimation.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alby, Virginie Jacob","journal":"Annales M\u00E9dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0c38048b93a2a6e5371ef28a591aa0286aa3209.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448720301554?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448720301554","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Nice"],"keyphrases":["the virus","the possible conclusions","we will look at the","the subjects is listened to","as it","it is important that the suffering","to understand the global epidemic","conducted during the Nice attacks in","During this","during the current pandemic context","that it involves as questions about the subject","giving an answer to the reality","Our proposal will be to consider the victim status as","we will base","we will also see that","this work","Abstract As part","To carry out our reflection","sublimation","travers\u00E9e","this crossing consists in going through various forms","in order that everyone can find his own way","coronavirus de type Covid","psychoanalytic orientation","attentats de Nice","r\u00E9el du virus","conclusions possibles","statut de victime","orientation psychanalytique men\u00E9e","continued today","psychological listening experience","recognized","including","imposed itself","More specifically","\u00E9coute psychologique","judged","souffrance des sujets","r\u00E9ponse","exp\u00E9rience","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie mondiale","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","cadre du pr\u00E9sent travail","compensated","sociobiological phenomenon","fa\u00E7on singuli\u00E8re","formes diverses","contexte pand\u00E9mique actuel","lieu","ph\u00E9nom\u00E8ne sociobiologique","questionnements","proposition","signifiant","derni\u00E8re","r\u00E9flexion"],"language":"fr"},

Co\u2010chaired by Professors Heinz Feldmann and J\u00FCrgen Richt, the conference explored 10 topics: (i) The ecology of emerging zoonotic diseases; (ii) The role of wildlife in emerging zoonoses; (iii) Cross\u2010species transmission of zoonotic pathogens; (iv) Emerging and neglected influenza viruses; (v) Haemorrhagic fever viruses; (vi) Emerging bacterial diseases; (vii) Outbreak responses to zoonotic diseases; (viii) Food\u2010borne zoonotic diseases; (ix) Prion diseases; and (x) Modelling and prediction of emergence of zoonoses. Human medicine, veterinary medicine and environmental challenges are viewed as a unity, which must be considered under the umbrella of \u2018One Health\u2019. Several presentations attempted to integrate the insights gained from field data with mathematical models in the search for effective control measures of specific zoonoses. The overriding objective of the research presentations was to create, improve and use the tools essential to address the risk of contagions in a globalized society. In seeking to fulfil this objective, a three\u2010step approach has often been applied: (i) use cultured cells, model and natural animal hosts and human clinical models to study infection; (ii) combine traditional histopathological and biochemical approaches with functional genomics, proteomics and computational biology; and (iii) obtain signatures of virulence and insights into mechanisms of host defense response, immune evasion and pathogenesis. This meeting review summarizes 39 of the conference presentations and mentions briefly the 16 articles in this Special Supplement, most of which were presented at the conference in earlier versions. The full affiliations of all presenters and many colleagues have been included to facilitate further inquiries from readers.","publish_time":"2012-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kahn, R.

It is continually thwarted, though, by the fact that the treated organism is highly dynamic and the target molecule(s) is (are) never static. In this article, we address some of the factors that modify and cause the mobility and plasticity of drug targets and their interactions with ligands and discuss how these can lead to unexpected (lack of) effects of drugs.

Recent studies also concluded that interactions between bICP0 and IRF7 inhibit trans-activation of IFN-\u03B2 promoter activity. The C3HC4 zinc RING (really important new gene) finger located near the amino terminus of bICP0 is important for all known functions of bICP0. A recombinant virus that contains a single amino acid change in a well conserved cysteine residue of the C3HC4 zinc RING finger of bICP0 grows poorly in cultured cells, and does not reactivate from latency in cattle confirming that the C3HC4 zinc RING finger is crucial for viral growth and pathogenesis. A bICP0 deletion mutant does not induce plaques in permissive cells, but induces autophagy in a cell type dependent manner.

Specimens collected during illness were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. RESULTS: In total, 993 HCoV infections were identified over 8 years, with OC43 most commonly seen and 229E the least. HCoVs were detected in a limited time period, between December and April/May, and peaked in January/February. Highest infection frequency was in children \u003C5 years (18 per 100 person-years), with little variation in older age groups (range: 7 to 11 per 100 person-years). Overall, 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children were associated with medical consultation. Of the 993 infections, 260 were acquired from an infected household contact. The serial interval between index and household-acquired cases ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days and the secondary infection risk ranged from 7.2% to 12.6% by type.

Methods In mid-March 2005, VRE Van B was isolated from 2 clinical samples from different wards. Despite such measures as screening patients sharing rooms with index cases and isolating VRE patients, 43 isolates from different wards were detected by the end of March 2005. To eradicate a hospital-wide outbreak, a coordinated strategy between March and June 2005 comprised (1) formation of a VRE task force, (2) hospital-wide screening, (3) isolation of carriers, (4) physical segregation of contacts, (5) surveillance of high-risk groups, (6) increased cleaning, (7) electronic tagging of VRE status, and (8) education and audits. This is a retrospective study of this multipronged approach to containing VRE. The adequacy of rectal swab sampling for VRE was assessed in a substudy of 111 patients. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)/VRE co-colonization or co-infection also was determined. Results A total of 19,574 contacts were identified. Between April and June 2005, 5095 patients were screened, yielding 104 VRE carriers, 54 of whom (52%) were detected in the first 2 weeks of hospital-wide screening. The initial positive yield of 11.4% of persons actively screened declined to 4.2% by the end of June 2005. Pulsed-field typing revealed 1 major clone and several minor clones among the 151 total VRE cases, including 4 clinical cases. Hospital-wide physical segregation of contacts from other patients was difficult to achieve in communal wards. Co-colonization or co-infection with MRSA, which was present in 52 of 151 cases (34%) and the indefinite electronic tagging of positive VRE status strained limited isolation beds. Analysis of 2 fecal or rectal specimens collected 1 day apart may detect at least 83% of VRE carriers. Conclusion A multipronged strategy orchestrated by a central task force curbed but could not eradicate VRE. Control measures were confounded by hospital infrastructure and high MRSA endemicity.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurup, Asok; Chlebicki, M. P.; Ling, M. L.; Koh, T. H.; Tan, K.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We categorized 81 eligible patients into bacterial infection, viral infection, coinfection, and non-infectious groups. The respiratory virus examination was determined by a liquid bead array xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel in pharyngeal swabs, while bacterial infection was studied by conventional sputum culture. LOS and CAT as well as demographic information were recorded. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 38 subjects, bacteria in 17, and of these, seven had both. Influenza virus was the most frequently isolated virus, followed by enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4, and respiratory syncytial virus. Bacteriologic analyses of sputum showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacteria, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The longest LOS and the highest CAT score were detected in coinfection group. CAT score was positively correlated with LOS. CONCLUSION: Respiratory infection is a common causative agent of exacerbations in COPD. Respiratory coinfection is likely to be a determinant of more severe acute exacerbations with longer LOS. CAT score may be a predictor of longer LOS in AECOPD.","publish_time":"2015-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Meng-Yuan; Qiao, Jin-Ping; Xu, Yuan-Hong; Fei, Guang-He","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0adc0c7498f0ebbb3c8f1c662da34605d5f91fe2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4621204.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s92160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527871/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD Assessment","COPD","LOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory infection","Respiratory coinfection","respiratory virus examination","respiratory syncytial virus","isolated virus","longest LOS","bacterial infection","highest CAT score","predictor of longer LOS","parainfluenza virus types","respiratory infectious phenotypes","viral infection","liquid bead array xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel","acute exacerbation of COPD","common bacteria","coinfection group","AECOPD","COPD Assessment Test","severe acute exacerbations","common causative agent of exacerbations","eligible patients","Bacteriologic analyses of sputum","conventional sputum culture","pharyngeal swabs","bocavirus","Scale","Escherichia coli","Acinetobacter baumannii","metapneumovirus","impact","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Klebsiella","coronavirus","enterovirus","rhinovirus","determinant","length of stay","Streptococcus pneumoniae","non-infectious groups","METHODS","CONCLUSION","demographic information","Viruses","subjects","PURPOSE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Bacterial co-infections may complicate and prolong paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay. Data on prevalence, type of pathogens and its association with disease severity are limited though. These data are especially important as bacterial co-infections may be treated using antibiotics and could reduce disease severity and duration of PICU stay. We investigated prevalence of bacterial co-infection and its association with disease severity and PICU stay. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of the prevalence and type of bacterial co-infections in ventilated children performed in a 14-bed tertiary care PICU in The Netherlands. Children less than 2 years of age admitted between December 2006 and November 2014 with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were included. Tracheal aspirates (TA) and broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) were cultured and scored based on the quantity of bacteria colony forming units (CFU) as: co-infection (TA \u003E 10(^5)/BAL \u003E 10(^4) CFU), low bacterial growth (TA \u003C 10(^5)/BAL \u003C 10(^4) CFU), or negative (no growth). Duration of mechanical ventilation and PICU stay were collected using medical records and compared against the presence of co-infection using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 167 included children 63 (37.7%) had a bacterial co-infection and 67 (40.1%) low bacterial growth. Co-infections occurred within 48 h from intubation in 52 out 63 (82.5%) co-infections. H.influenza (40.0%), S.pneumoniae (27.1%), M.catarrhalis (22.4%), and S.aureus (7.1%) were the most common pathogens. PICU stay and mechanical ventilation lasted longer in children with co-infections than children with negative cultures (9.1 vs 7.7 days, p = 0.04 and 8.1vs 6.5 days, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this large study, bacterial co-infections occurred in more than a third of children requiring invasive ventilation for bronchiolitis and were associated with longer PICU stay and mechanical ventilation. These findings support a clinical trial of antibiotics to test whether antibiotics can reduce duration of PICU stay.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiegers, Hanke M.

Methods As several years have now passed, it is possible to interrogate national statistics that have become available since the outbreak to provide a more accurate estimate of the actual macro-economic impact of SARS. National statistics were examined for anomalies that corresponded to the timing of the SARS outbreak and, where possible, the size of any gain or loss found estimated. Results Estimates and models produced at the time of the outbreak suggested that SARS could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy. Our analysis suggests that the scale of the SARS impact on affected economies was far smaller than suggested by contemporary media reports and model estimates. Conclusions This exercise holds important lessons for estimating the economic impact of future outbreaks \u2013 such as pandemic influenza \u2013 and measures to control or prevent them. We suggest that further work is needed to develop a more comprehensive macro-economic model able to more accurately estimate the relative cost and effect of a global response to outbreaks of international concern.

The outbreak initially infected farm pigs and then moved to humans from pigs with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of about 40%. After 2001, regular outbreaks occurred with higher CFRs (~71%, 2001\u20135, ~93%, 2008\u201312). The spread arose from drinking virus-laden palm date sap and human-to-human transmission. Intrinsic disorder analysis revealed strong correlation between the percentage of disorder in the N protein and CFR (Regression: r(2) = 0.93, p \u003C 0.01, ANOVA: p \u003C 0.01). Distinct disorder and, therefore, genetic differences can be found in all three group of strains. The fact that the transmission modes of the Malaysia strain are different from those of the Bangladesh strains suggests that the correlations may also be linked to the modes of viral transmission. Analysis of the NiV and related viruses suggests links between modes of transmission and disorder of not just the N protein but, also, of M shell protein. The links among shell disorder, transmission modes, and virulence suggest mechanisms by which viruses are attenuated as they passed through different cell hosts from different animal species. These have implications for development of vaccines and epidemiological molecular analytical tools to contain outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

Among them, rotaviruses are one of the most important causes of diarrhea in young animals and human infants. A lack of understanding of mechanisms to induce intestinal immunity and the correlates of protective immunity in neonates has impaired development of safe and effective vaccines against enteric viruses. Studies of candidate vaccines using an adult mouse model of subclinical enteric viral infections often do not predict vaccine efficacy against disease evaluated in neonatal large animals. A series of studies have been conducted using a neonatal gnotobiotic pig model of rotavirus infection and diarrhea to identify correlates of protective immunity and to evaluate traditional and novel vaccine approaches for the induction of mucosal immune responses and protection to enteric viruses. Gnotobiotic pigs recovered from infection with virulent Wa human rotavirus (HRV) (mimic natural infection) had high numbers of intestinal IgA rotavirus-specific primary antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and memory B-cells (to recall antigen) measured by ELISPOT assay, which correlated with complete protection against rotavirus challenge. Most short-term IgA memory B-cells were resident in the ileum, the major site of rotavirus replication. Spleen, not the bone marrow, was the major resident site for longer-term IgG memory B-cells. Candidate rotavirus vaccines evaluated in pigs for their ability to induce intestinal or systemic ASC and protection against rotavirus infection and diarrhea included attenuated live virus, inactivated virus, and baculovirus-expressed double-layered rotavirus-like particles (2/6-VLPs). In combination with those candidate vaccines, various adjuvants, delivery systems, and immunization routes were tested, including incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant for i.m. immunization, and a mutant Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin R192G (mLT) for i.n. immunization. It was shown that orally administered replicating vaccines were most effective for priming for intestinal IgA ASC and memory B-cell responses, but i.n. administered non-replicating 2/6-VLPs plus mLT were effective as booster vaccines. We conclude that protective immunity depends on the magnitude, location, viral protein-specificity, and isotype of the antibody responses induced by vaccination. Therefore highly effective enteric viral vaccines should: (i) induce sufficient levels of intestinal IgA antibodies; (ii) include viral antigens that induce neutralizing antibodies; and (iii) require the use of effective mucosal adjuvants or antigen delivery systems for non-replicating oral or i.n. vaccines.","publish_time":"2002-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Lijuan; Saif, Linda J","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ca704516c253ae250de0ed2598315aa1beceda8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119626.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242702000466; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242702000466","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective vaccines","Candidate rotavirus vaccines","effective enteric viral vaccines","replicating vaccines","intestinal immunity","rotavirus challenge","booster vaccines","Studies of candidate vaccines","Enteric viruses","intestinal IgA ASC","major site of rotavirus replication","short-term IgA memory B-cells","double-layered rotavirus","neonatal gnotobiotic pig model of rotavirus infection","memory B-cell responses","virulent Wa human rotavirus","correlates of protective immunity","high numbers of intestinal IgA rotavirus-specific primary antibody-secreting cells","longer-term IgG memory B-cells","major cause of diarrhea","sufficient levels of intestinal IgA antibodies","natural infection","antibody responses","use of effective mucosal adjuvants","non-replicating","viral antigens","major resident site","adult mouse model of subclinical enteric viral infections","antigen delivery systems","mLT","important causes of diarrhea","complete protection","viral protein-specificity","young animals","neonatal large animals","immunization routes","Gnotobiotic pigs","VLPs","induction of mucosal immune responses","inactivated virus","various adjuvants","systemic ASC","vaccine efficacy","human infants","neutralizing antibodies","series of studies","attenuated live virus","novel vaccine approaches","mutant Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin R192G","impaired development of safe","ASCs","neonates","baculovirus","HRV","disease","location","isotype","magnitude","ability","ileum","bone marrow","incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant","particles","mechanisms","ELISPOT assay","lack of understanding","humans","combination","Spleen","vaccination","rotaviruses"],"language":"en"},

We systematically evaluated these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to mitigate disease risk. Wild dogs from 16 sites representing five unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and Babesia spp. exposure. Analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens, but Babesia was never detected. Exposure to CDV was associated with unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a high probability of domestic dog contact and, in the case of protected-unfenced areas, likely reside amongst high wildlife densities. Our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies and coronavirus exposure risk. Therefore, domestic dogs may be a source of CDV, rabies and coronavirus, while wildlife may also play an important role in CDV transmission dynamics. Relatively high parvovirus seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in the absence of spillover from domestic dogs. Should intervention be needed to control pathogens in wild dogs, efforts to prevent rabies and coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination. If prevention of CDV and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity, control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce transmission risks, and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the optimal strategy.","publish_time":"2012-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prager, K.

Since the IFNL4-\u0394G allele has been linked to impaired viral clearance, we hypothesized that potential exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens, as assessed by the number of lifetime sexual partners, may increase prostate cancer risk in an IFNL4-\u0394G-dependent manner. Accordingly, we find that men with 10 or more sexual partners and at least one copy of IFNL4-\u0394G have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer while those with the same number of partners but lacking IFNL4-\u0394G do not.

For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies.

Coronavirus has a history of causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 \u00C5. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which will facilitate to vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guan, Hongxin; Wang, Youwang; Saeed, Abdullah F.U.H.; Li, Jinyu; Jan, Syed Sajid; Per\u010Dulija, Vanja; Li, Yu; Zhu, Ping; Ouyang, Songying","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eec957a9c4c13d9de986f758c0cc205c4c1ce5e7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/780fc85ab807f33f706a38c86480e284da800cb8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SADS-CoV S structure","SARS-CoV","novel coronavirus","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV","evolutionary relationships of SADS","importance of S protein","Coronavirus host range","swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus","novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","compact architecture of S trimer","current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","CTD","human cells","viral immune evasion","host immune responses","viral entry","evolutionary process","subunit pack","understanding of structural","comparison of NTD","diverse species","cryo-EM structure","characteristic structural features","broad species tropism","intra-subunit quaternary packing mode","Rhinolophus","masking of epitopes","glycan shielding","new insights","prefusion conformation","genus of horseshoe bats","epidemics","COVID","study","functional diversity","cell lines","spike glycoprotein","great public health concern","resolution","data","history","piglets","animals","genera","addition","vaccine development"],"language":"en"},

Of importance are emissions of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), aerosols and their precursors (soot and sulphate), and increased cloudiness in the form of persistent linear contrails and induced-cirrus cloudiness. The recent Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) quantified aviation\u0027s RF contribution for 2005 based upon 2000 operations data. Aviation has grown strongly over the past years, despite world-changing events in the early 2000s; the average annual passenger traffic growth rate was 5.3% yr(\u22121) between 2000 and 2007, resulting in an increase of passenger traffic of 38%. Presented here are updated values of aviation RF for 2005 based upon new operations data that show an increase in traffic of 22.5%, fuel use of 8.4% and total aviation RF of 14% (excluding induced-cirrus enhancement) over the period 2000\u20132005. The lack of physical process models and adequate observational data for aviation-induced cirrus effects limit confidence in quantifying their RF contribution. Total aviation RF (excluding induced cirrus) in 2005 was \u223C55 mW m(\u22122) (23\u201387 mW m(\u22122), 90% likelihood range), which was 3.5% (range 1.3\u201310%, 90% likelihood range) of total anthropogenic forcing. Including estimates for aviation-induced cirrus RF increases the total aviation RF in 2005\u201378 mW m(\u22122) (38\u2013139 mW m(\u22122), 90% likelihood range), which represents 4.9% of total anthropogenic forcing (2\u201314%, 90% likelihood range). Future scenarios of aviation emissions for 2050 that are consistent with IPCC SRES A1 and B2 scenario assumptions have been presented that show an increase of fuel usage by factors of 2.7\u20133.9 over 2000. Simplified calculations of total aviation RF in 2050 indicate increases by factors of 3.0\u20134.0 over the 2000 value, representing 4\u20134.7% of total RF (excluding induced cirrus). An examination of a range of future technological options shows that substantive reductions in aviation fuel usage are possible only with the introduction of radical technologies. Incorporation of aviation into an emissions trading system offers the potential for overall (i.e., beyond the aviation sector) CO(2) emissions reductions. Proposals exist for introduction of such a system at a European level, but no agreement has been reached at a global level.","publish_time":"2009-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, David S.; Fahey, David W.; Forster, Piers M.; Newton, Peter J.; Wit, Ron C.N.; Lim, Ling L.; Owen, Bethan; Sausen, Robert","journal":"Atmos Environ (1994)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cea29890a56768bf550205d4ec9b83b54017fe3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185790.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231009003574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362760/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2009.04.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231009003574","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fourth Assessment Report","IPCC SRES","CO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aviation-induced cirrus RF","total RF","Incorporation of aviation","aviation sector","Simplified calculations of total aviation RF","updated values of aviation RF","aviation fuel usage","Future scenarios of aviation emissions","likelihood range","aviation-induced cirrus effects limit confidence","induced-cirrus enhancement","cirrus cloudiness","total anthropogenic forcing","mW","quantified aviation\u0027s RF contribution","emissions reductions","increase of passenger traffic","emissions trading system","increase of fuel usage","range of future technological options","emissions of carbon dioxide","new operations data","radiative forcing","fuel use","factors","adequate observational data","Climate Change","average annual passenger traffic growth rate","substantive reductions","increased cloudiness","European level","global level","IPCC SRES A1","introduction of radical technologies","lack of physical process models","Intergovernmental Panel","form of persistent linear contrails","B2 scenario assumptions","AR4","soot","world","events","sulphate","estimates","Assessment Report","aerosols","precursors","agreement","past years","yr","importance","potential","examination","nitrogen oxides","period","Proposals"],"language":"en"},

A number of volatile pheromones have been reported, but no MUP pheromones have been identified in rat urine. RESULTS: We used sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF), nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) after in gel digestion of the proteins and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and showed that the levels of two MUPs, odorant-binding protein 3 (OBP3) (i.e. PGCL4) and MUP13 (i.e. PGCL1), in urine and their mRNAs in liver were higher in males than in females and were suppressed by orchidectomy and restored by testosterone treatment (T treatment). We then generated recombinant MUPs (rMUPs) and found that the sexual attractiveness of urine from castrated males to females significantly increased after the addition of either recombinant OBP3 (rOBP3) or recombinant MUP13 (rMUP13). Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we further examined neuronal activation in the brains of female rats after they sniffed rOBP3 or rMUP13. Both rOBP3 and rMUP13 activated the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), medial preoptic area (MPA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), medial amygdala (MeA), posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), which participate in the neural circuits responsible for pheromone-induced sexual behaviours. In particular, more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos-ir) cells were observed in the posterior AOB than in the anterior AOB. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of OBP3 and MUP13 was male-biased and androgen-dependent. They attracted females and activated brain areas related to sexual behaviours in female rats, suggesting that both OBP3 and MUP13 are male pheromones in rats.

Conversely, PSV infection was sensitive to NH4Cl, chloroquine, dynasore, nystatin, M\u03B2CD and wortmannin with reduced PSV VP1 expression levels and virus titer. Additionally, PSV invasion leaded to rapid actin rearrangement and disruption of the cellular actin network enhanced PSV infection. After internalization the virus was transported to late endosomes and/or cycling endosomes that requires the participation of Rab7 and Rab11.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. Cases We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Discussion The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. Conclusions Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria.

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and MedRxiv database were searched using the specific keywords up to April 30, 2020. Studies that met our objectives were assessed for the risk of bias applying various tools as indicated. Three studies each that reported the outcome of viral clearance by RT-PCR and death due to all cause, were meta-analyzed by applying inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic risk ratio (RR) using a random effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I(2) statistic and funnel plots, respectively. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 210) on viral clearance assessed by RT-PCR showed no benefit (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.38; p = 0.74), although with a moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 61.7%, p = 0.07).

Human coronaviruses cause respiratory infections that range in seriousness from common colds to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Like influenza, coronaviruses can be neurotropic. To test for associations between coronaviruses and serious mental disorders, we utilized a recently developed assay and measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) response against 4 human coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) in 106 patients with a recent onset of psychotic symptoms and 196 nonpsychiatric controls. We expressed results quantitatively as antibody levels and qualitatively as seroprevalence relative to a defined seropositivity cutoff value. Patient IgG levels were higher than controls for HKU1, NL63, and OC43, with HKU1 and NL63 both showing highly significant patient-to-control differences (HKU1, P \u2264 .002; NL63, P \u2264 .00001).

Serum and aqueous humor was collected from clinically normal, random source cats (n = 10); clinically normal, specific-pathogen free cats experimentally inoculated with Toxoplasma gondii strain ME49 and sampled sequentially for 20 months (n = 4); and client-owned cats with uveitis (n = 27). Interleukin 6 activity was measured in each sample. Client-owned cats with uveitis were also evaluated for evidence of present or prior exposure to T. gondii, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline coronaviruses. Interleukin 6 activity was non-detectable or low in serum from cats of each group. Interleukin 6 activity was not detected in aqueous humor of clinically normal cats. Interleukin 6 activity was detected in 22 27 (81.5%) aqueous humor samples from cats with uveitis, with a range of 28.9 U ml\u22121-15702.9 U ml\u22121 (mean = 1911.9 U ml\u22121, SD = 3946.7 U ml\u22121).

Statistically significant increases in mean IL-6 activity in aqueous humor were found for cats with any evidence of infection with T. gondii, for cats with T. gondii antigen in aqueous humor and for cats with coronavirus antibody titers \u2265 1:100. Aqueous humor IL-6 activity was greater than corresponding serum IL-6 activity in 21 27 cats.

Although mortality is low, infection with IBV results in substantial losses for the egg and meat chicken industries. Despite the economic importance of IBV and decades of research into the pathogenesis of infection, significant gaps in our knowledge exist. The aim of this study was to compare the early progression of air sac lesions in birds receiving a vaccine strain of the virus or a more virulent field strain. The air sacs are lined by different types of epithelia and are relatively isolated from the environment, so they represent a unique tissue in which to study virus-induced lesions. Both the pathogenic and vaccine strains of the virus produced significant lesions; however, the lesions progressed more rapidly in the birds receiving the pathogenic strain. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in birds infected with the pathogenic strain of virus, IBV spike protein is detected first in the ciliated cells lining the air sac. These preliminary data provide important clues regarding potential mechanisms for IBV tissue tropism and spread and show that the nature of the virus isolate influences the early progression of IBV infection.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bezuidenhout, A.; Mondal, S.

Reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect antibodies against different PEDV strains in pig serum. A total of 732 serum samples from North American or European pigs were tested. Samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical (G1a PEDV) or variant genogroup 1 PEDV (G1b PEDV), pandemic genogroup 2 PEDV (G2b PEDV) or non-infected controls. Field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown PEDV exposure were also used. Three indirect ELISAs based on G2b antigens (ELISAs 1, 2 and 3), a competitive ELISA based on the G2b antigen (ELISA 4) and a competitive ELISA based on the G1a antigen (ELISA 5) were compared. Overall, the tests had a moderate agreement (\u03BA=0.61). G1a PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISA 3, G1b PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISAs 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the G2b PEDV group.

Taken together, these findings suggested that various variant lineages were co-circulating in China now, and appeared to be continuously evolving, alternative indigenous vaccines indeed need for effective control of IB in China.","publish_time":"2011-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Hongbin; Qin, Jianping; Chen, Feng; Xie, Qingmei; Bi, Yingzuo; Cao, Yongchang; Xue, Chunyi","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089129.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-011-0657-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21842233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GenBank","CH VI","IB"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["isolated strains","Chinese IBV strains","current vaccine strains","CH VI","field strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus","GD","various variant lineages","Mass variant lineage","different areas of China","Chinese isolates","S1 genes","S1 glycoprotein genes","nucleotide homologies","previous isolates TC07","amino acid homologies","KP10","NC10","diseased chicken flocks","co-circulating","effective control of IB","larger evolutionary distances","ongoing surveillance program","study","alternative indigenous vaccines","findings","nephropathogenic","GenBank"],"language":"en"},

(1995) Arch. Virol. 140, 259\u2013271]. In the present report we describe the sequences of the remaining genes of this strain (gene 3, 4 and 5) with the exception of gene 1 (RNA polymerase gene). Gene 3 contained three open reading frames (ORFs), 3a, 3b and 3c of 174, 195 and 282 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Gene 4 (membrane (M) protein gene) consisted of 749 nt with a single ORF of 687 nt. Gene 5 contained two ORFs, 5a and 5b, with 198 and 249 nt, respectively. Thus, in total, there were 7349 nt from the 5\u2032 end of S protein gene to the 3\u2032 end of the CU-T2 genome. The overall nt sequence homologies between gene 3, 4, and 5 of CU-T2 and those of other strains were between 84.1\u201390.8%, 85.8\u201388.8% and 90.4\u201396.4%, respectively. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequence homologies revealed that gene 3b and 5b were more conserved than 3a, 3c and 5a. Each individual gene of CU-T2 strain (with the exception of the RNA polymerase gene) had a different level of homology with the homologous gene of other strains, suggesting that the evolution of IBV strains in general has been a complex, and as yet, poorly understood process. \u00A9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Up to date, there is no approved or licensed vaccine or antiviral medicines can be used to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients. Here, we analyzed the antiviral activities of resveratrol, a natural compound found in grape seeds and skin and in red wine, against MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: We performed MTT and neutral red uptake assays to assess the survival rates of MERS-infected Vero E6 cells. In addition, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescent assays determined the intracellular viral RNA and protein expression. For viral productivity, we utilized plaque assays to confirm the antiviral properties of resveratrol against MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Resveratrol significantly inhibited MERS-CoV infection and prolonged cellular survival after virus infection. We also found that the expression of nucleocapsid (N) protein essential for MERS-CoV replication was decreased after resveratrol treatment. Furthermore, resveratrol down-regulated the apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV in vitro. By consecutive administration of resveratrol, we were able to reduce the concentration of resveratrol while achieving inhibitory effectiveness against MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: In this study, we first demonstrated that resveratrol is a potent anti-MERS agent in vitro. We perceive that resveratrol can be a potential antiviral agent against MERS-CoV infection in the near future.","publish_time":"2017-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Shih-Chao; Ho, Chi-Tang; Chuo, Wen-Ho; Li, Shiming; Wang, Tony T.; Lin, Chi-Chen","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af547c43638857c71c035fa4217e167f681f837c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5307780.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2253-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV replication","inhibited MERS-CoV infection","concentration of resveratrol","resveratrol treatment","survival rates of MERS","antiviral properties of resveratrol","antiviral activities of resveratrol","potent anti-MERS agent","consecutive administration of resveratrol","virus infection","antiviral medicines","potential antiviral agent","immunofluorescent assays","plaque assays","protein expression","viral productivity","neutral red uptake assays","intracellular viral RNA","emerging viral pathogen","protein essential","red wine","infected patients","expression of nucleocapsid","prolonged cellular survival","infected Vero E6 cells","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","western blotting","natural compound","grape seeds","BACKGROUND","skin","severe morbidity","MTT","inhibitory effectiveness","quantitative PCR","addition","licensed vaccine","near future","mortality","RESULTS","apoptosis","METHODS","study","CONCLUSION","date"],"language":"en"},

This review article discusses the clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, interpretation of data, and treatment/prognosis of this unique syndrome with distinctive review of the spectrum of MOG antibodies.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santoro, Jonathan D.; Chitnis, Tanuja","journal":"Neuropediatrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f0488f42f7740689d90a035a6061f55585196ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117081.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1693152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340401/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical diagnosis","ADEM presentations","differential diagnosis","unique syndrome","interpretation of data","appropriate interpretation","heterogenous syndrome","distinctive review","review article","spectrum of MOG antibodies","demyelinating disorders of childhood","recognized set of disorders","focal neurologic findings","antibody-associated diseases","neurodiagnostic components","encephalopathy","prognosis","treatment","Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein","patient\u0027s presentation","abnormal neuroimaging","Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","phenotypes"],"language":"en"},

Viral infections induce simultaneous production of type I (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) and type III (IFN-\u03BB) interferons. All nucleated cells are believed to respond to IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2, whereas IFN-\u03BB responses are largely confined to epithelial cells. We observed that intestinal epithelial cells, unlike hematopoietic cells of this organ, express only very low levels of functional IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptors. Accordingly, after oral infection of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor-deficient mice, human reovirus type 3 specifically infected cells in the lamina propria but, strikingly, did not productively replicate in gut epithelial cells. By contrast, reovirus replicated almost exclusively in gut epithelial cells of IFN-\u03BB receptor-deficient mice, suggesting that the gut mucosa is equipped with a compartmentalized IFN system in which epithelial cells mainly respond to IFN-\u03BB that they produce after viral infection, whereas other cells of the gut mostly rely on IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 for antiviral defense. In suckling mice with IFN-\u03BB receptor deficiency, reovirus replicated in the gut epithelium and additionally infected epithelial cells lining the bile ducts, indicating that infants may use IFN-\u03BB for the control of virus infections in various epithelia-rich tissues. Thus, IFN-\u03BB should be regarded as an autonomous virus defense system of the gut mucosa and other epithelial barriers that may have evolved to avoid unnecessarily frequent triggering of the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 system which would induce exacerbated inflammation.","publish_time":"2015-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahlak\u00F5iv, Tanel; Hernandez, Pedro; Gronke, Konrad; Diefenbach, Andreas; Staeheli, Peter","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3334a3ad6a9e88664342aff618229775fb3e31a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4388470.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25849543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gut epithelial cells of IFN","IFN-\u03BB responses","infected epithelial cells","intestinal epithelial cells","infected cells","IFN-\u03BB receptor deficiency","compartmentalized IFN system","hematopoietic cells","nucleated cells","oral infection of IFN","low levels of functional IFN-\u03B1","\u03B2 system","epithelial barriers","gut mucosa","\u03BB receptor-deficient mice","\u03B2 receptor-deficient mice","\u03B2 receptors","gut epithelium","viral infections","human reovirus type","suckling mice","control of virus infections","autonomous virus defense system","simultaneous production of type","antiviral defense","various epithelia-rich tissues","viruses","barrier surfaces","bile ducts","molecular networks","major port of entry","organ","infants","lamina propria","exacerbated inflammation","frequent triggering","interferons","contrast"],"language":"en"},

From a physiological standpoint, studies using cortisol, heart rate and heart rate variability, temperature changes, and immune function are discussed. Behavioural measures are also of great relevance when addressing canine welfare, thus studies on fear and anxiety behaviours, abnormal behaviours like stereotypies, as well as responses to strangers and novel objects are reviewed. Finally, a limited number of studies attempting to use cognitive bias and learning ability are also mentioned as cognitive measures. The literature to date provides a strong background for which measures may be useful in determining the welfare of kennelled canines, however more research is needed to further assess the value of using these methods, particularly in regard to the large degree of individual differences that exist between dogs.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Polg\u00E1r, Zita; Blackwell, Emily J.; Rooney, Nicola J.","journal":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc131dc2b4872ee6c3cdd325739368c4e47e242b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126575.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159118301047; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168159118301047; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2019.02.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287573/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["welfare of dogs","cognitive measures","based measures","Behavioural measures","kennelled dogs","canine welfare","welfare states","welfare of kennelled canines","heart rate variability","limited number of studies","anxiety behaviours","abnormal behaviours","cognitive bias","importance of animal","Animal science","fear","cortisol","temperature changes","stereotypies","paper","great relevance","strong background","learning ability","large degree of individual differences","responses","regard","particular focus","validity","immune function","physiological standpoint","Abstract Hundreds of thousands","strangers","novel objects","practicality","literature","date","standard protocols","methods","research","kennels","environments"],"language":"en"},

These viruses display a wide range of sizes, morphologies and symmetries. Spherical viruses are often isometric and their envelope proteins follow icosahedral symmetry. Filamentous and pleomorphic viruses lack such global symmetry but their surface proteins may display locally ordered assemblies. Determining the structures of enveloped viruses, including the envelope proteins and their protein-protein interactions on the viral surface, is of paramount importance. These structures can reveal how the virions are assembled and released by budding from the infected host cell, how the progeny virions infect new cells by membrane fusion, and how antibodies bind surface epitopes to block infection. In this chapter, we discuss the uses of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in elucidating structures of enveloped virions. Starting from a detailed outline of data collection and processing strategies, we highlight how cryo-EM has been successfully utilized to provide unique insights into enveloped virus entry, assembly, and neutralization.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stass, Robert; Ng, Weng M.; Kim, Young Chan; Huiskonen, Juha T.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13886da50759622e1a74ab731e837e7443783e5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112279.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352719300260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522708/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352719300260; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.07.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structures of enveloped viruses","surface proteins","Abstract Enveloped viruses","membrane proteins","envelope proteins","pleomorphic viruses","Spherical viruses","elucidating structures of enveloped virions","enveloped virus entry","viral surface","progeny virions","cryo-EM","surface epitopes","protein-protein interactions","membrane fusion","global symmetry","icosahedral symmetry","processing strategies","uses of cryogenic electron microscopy","antibodies","new cells","assembly","genomes","detailed outline of data collection","wide range of sizes","unique insights","morphologies","lipid bilayer","infected host cell","symmetries","infection","paramount importance","neutralization","assemblies","chapter"],"language":"en"},

A large open reading frame encodes a 389 amino acid protein of 43,366 Da, which is presumably the nucleocapsid protein. The predicted protein is similar in size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence to the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses. This is especially evident when the sequence is compared with that of the antigenically related porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), with which a region of 46% amino acid sequence homology was found. Hydropathy profiles revealed the existence of several conserved domains which could have functional significance. An intergenic consensus sequence precedes the 5\u2032-end of the proposed nucleocapsid protein gene. The consensus sequence is present in other coronaviruses and has been proposed as the site of binding of the leader sequence for mRNA transcriptional start. This region was also examined by primer extension analysis of mRNAs, which identified a 60-nucleotide leader sequence. The 3\u2032-noncoding region of the genome contains an 11-nucleotide sequence, which is relatively conserved throughout the Coronavirus family and lends support to the theory that this region is important for the replication of negative-strand RNA.","publish_time":"1989-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schreiber, Steven S.; Kamahora, Toshio; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c1a8c61f6c227dc2eadb791ab941ed5db582092.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289900500; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289900500","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hydropathy"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequence analysis","nucleotide sequence","nucleotide leader sequence","amino acid sequence homology","intergenic consensus sequence","amino acid protein","predicted protein","proposed nucleocapsid protein gene","noncoding region","Abstract Human coronaviruses","important human pathogens","molecular biology of human coronavirus","nucleocapsid proteins","genome","molecular cloning","Coronavirus family","viral RNA","conserved domains","strand RNA","primer extension analysis of mRNAs","chemical properties","TGEV","size","related porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus","HCV","end","large open reading frame","replication of negative","mRNA transcriptional start","existence","support","theory","site of binding","terminal","functional significance","Hydropathy profiles","nucleotides","established protocols","multiple sclerosis"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Viruses cause disease after they break through the natural protective barriers of the body, evade immune control, and either kill cells of an important tissue or trigger a destructive immune and inflammatory response. The outcome of a viral infection is determined by the nature of the virushost interaction and the host\u0027s response to the infection. Viral infections can be lytic or persistent (latency, recurrence and / or transformation of the the cell). Immune response is the best treatment, but it often contributes to the pathogenesis of a viral infection.

At present, the data have been predominantly obtained using established cell lines and/or CXCR4-tropic laboratory-adapted virus strains. There is also ambiguity about which disulfide isomerases/ reductases play a major role in HIV-1 entry, as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and/or thioredoxin (Trx) have emerged as the two enzymes most often implicated in this process. RESULTS: We have extended our previous findings and those of others by focusing on CCR5-using HIV-1 strains and their natural targets - primary human macrophages and CD4(\u002B) T lymphocytes. We found that the nonspecific thiol/disulfide exchange inhibitor, 5,5\u0027-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), significantly reduced HIV-1 entry and infection in cell lines, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and also phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Subsequent studies were performed using specific anti-PDI or Trx monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped and wild type (wt) virus infection systems. Although human donor-to-donor variability was observed as expected, Trx appeared to play a greater role than PDI in HIV-1 infection of MDM. In contrast, PDI, but not Trx, was predominantly involved in HIV-1 entry and infection of the CD4(\u002B)/CCR5(\u002B) T cell line, PM-1, and PHA-stimulated primary human T lymphocytes. Intriguingly, both PDI and Trx were present on the surface of MDM, PM-1 and PHA-stimulated CD4(\u002B) T cells. However, considerably lower levels of Trx were detected on freshly isolated CD4(\u002B) lymphocytes, compared to PHA-stimulated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings clearly demonstrate the role of thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 entry in primary T lymphocytes and MDM. They also establish a cell-type specificity regarding the involvement of particular disulfide isomerases/reductases in this process and may provide an explanation for differences among previously published studies. More importantly, from an in vivo perspective, the preferential utilization of PDI may be relevant to the HIV-1 entry and establishment of virus reservoirs in resting CD4(\u002B) cells, while the elevated levels of Trx reported in the chronic stages of HIV-1 infection may facilitate the virus entry in macrophages and help to sustain high viremia during the decline of T lymphocytes.","publish_time":"2012-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stantchev, Tzanko S; Paciga, Mark; Lankford, Carla R; Schwartzkopff, Franziska; Broder, Christopher C; Clouse, Kathleen A","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/209fd978d66d8ffe04712de07dc7e07b779baa08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3526565.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-9-97; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23206338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHA","PDI","MDM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of","reduced HIV","virus entry","T cells","primary T lymphocytes","PHA-stimulated CD4","PHA-stimulated primary human T lymphocytes","PHA-stimulated cells","chronic stages of HIV","decline of T lymphocytes","virus infection systems","T cell line","elevated levels of Trx","lower levels of Trx","disulfide exchange inhibitor","role of disulfide bond remodeling","role of thiol","human donor","Trx monoclonal antibodies","resting CD4","isolated CD4","process","specific anti-PDI","protein disulfide isomerase","preferential utilization of PDI","involvement of particular disulfide isomerases","major role","greater role","natural targets - primary human macrophages","cell-type specificity","established cell lines","human monocyte-derived macrophages","stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells","reductases","establishment of virus reservoirs","PM","CCR5","present","CXCR4-tropic laboratory-adapted virus strains","wild type","surface of MDM","nonspecific thiol","published studies","Subsequent studies","donor variability","previous findings","wt","mAb","envelope","PBMC","high viremia","dithiobis","explanation","DTNB","phytohemagglutinin","nitrobenzoic acid","differences","perspective","BACKGROUND","ambiguity","contrast","data","thioredoxin","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","enzymes"],"language":"en"},

IFITMs not only inhibit viral entry into host cells by interrupting the membrane fusion between viral envelope and cellular membranes, but also reduce the production of infectious virions or infectivity of progeny virions. Not surprisingly, some viruses can evade the restriction of IFITMs and even hijack the antiviral proteins to facilitate their infectious entry into host cells or promote the assembly of virions, presumably by modulating membrane fusion. Similar to many other host defense genes that evolve under the selective pressure of microorganism infection, IFITM genes evolved in an accelerated speed in vertebrates and many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the human population, some of which have been associated with severity and prognosis of viral infection (e.g., influenza A virus). Here, we review the function and potential impact of genetic variation for IFITM restriction of viral infections. Continuing research efforts are required to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the complicated interaction among IFITMs and viruses in an effort to determine their pathobiological roles in the context of viral infections in vivo.","publish_time":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xuesen; Li, Jiarui; Winkler, Cheryl A.; An, Ping; Guo, Ju-Tao","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/471d089defc5afd2af77f05c43b8be4cdc103bab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6338058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30687247/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral entry","viral envelope","restriction of IFITMs","IFITM restriction of viral infections","prognosis of viral infection","context of viral infections","host cells","IFITM genes","production of infectious virions","infectious entry","host defense genes","assembly of virions","antiviral proteins","transmembrane proteins","viruses","infectivity of progeny virions","modulating membrane fusion","family of small proteins","cellular membranes","endolysosomal membranes","selective pressure of microorganism infection","potential impact of genetic variation","vertebrates","accelerated speed","complicated interaction","single-nucleotide polymorphisms","pathobiological roles","function","molecular mechanism","plasma","SNPs","influenza","severity","Interferon","Continuing research efforts","human population"],"language":"en"},

RNA was extracted from body cavity effusion samples of 71 cats, including 34 samples from cats with a definitive diagnosis of FIP, and 37 samples of control cats with similar clinical signs but other confirmed diseases. Two reaction mixtures (Isothermal Mastermix, OptiGene Ltd.and PCRun\u2122 Molecular Detection Mix, Biogal) were tested using the same primers, which were designed to bind to a conserved region of the FCoV membrane protein gene. Both assays were conducted under isothermal conditions (61 \u00B0C\u201362 \u00B0C). Using the Isothermal Mastermix of OptiGene Ltd., amplification times ranged from 4 and 39 min with a sensitivity of 35.3% and a specificity of 94.6% for the reported sample group. Using the PCRun\u2122 Molecular Detection Mix of Biogal, amplification times ranged from 18 to 77 min with a sensitivity of 58.8% and a specificity of 97.3%. Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than real time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), it can be performed without the need of expensive equipment and with less hands-on time.

The TrachView Videoscope (TV) consists of a narrow high-resolution fiberoptic cable whose tip is positioned at the distal end of the endotracheal tube. The image is displayed on a small portable bedside monitor. In this way, the TV does not alter the standard method of intubation but adds a second, possibly improved, view of the vocal cords. The TV has never been formally studied. We determine the ease of use and improvement in the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score using the TV by individuals with various levels of intubation experience. Methods: The study was conducted in 2 phases on a mannequin model during an airway laboratory for emergency medicine residents and medical students in a university setting. Phase 1 consisted of a nonrandomized group sequential study design in which, after a 10-minute demonstration of the TV, emergency medicine residents assessed the POGO score using direct laryngoscopy (DL) and compared it with their observed POGO score using the TV. Part 2 consisted of a crossover study with first- and second-year medical students with no intubation experience. The students were randomized into 2 groups that differed by the method of intubation instruction given first: DL or TV. The students were given a 10-minute demonstration of each technique and had 2 attempts to return the demonstration. The POGO score noted by the student was recorded for each technique. The groups were then crossed and the process was repeated. Additional information collected from study subjects included ease of use of the TV and improvement in intubation using the TV. Results: In phase 1, the residents consisted of 4 postgraduate year (PGY)-1, 10 PGY-2, and 11 PGY-3 residents, and 3 participants whose level was not recorded, for a total of 28. Overall, the median POGO score for DL was 50%, and the median POGO score for TV was 100% (P\u003C.001). The median difference in POGO scores (TV and DL) was as follows: 50% for PGY-1 residents, 50% for PGY-2 residents, and 25% for PGY-3 residents. As for ease of use, 85.7% (24) reported that the TV was \u201Ceasy\u201D to use, 10.7% (3) were undecided, and 3.6% (1) reported that the TV was \u201Cdifficult\u201D to use, whereas 82.1% (23) reported that the TV improved their intubation attempt, 14.3% (4) reported no difference, and 3.6% (1) reported that the TV made the intubation attempt more difficult. In phase 2, there were 37 participants. Overall, the median TV and DL POGO scores were 75% and 25%, respectively (P=.004). The median difference in POGO scores (TV and DL) for the 2 groups was as follows: 75% for group 1 and 50% for group 2. Of all the participants, 67.6% (25) ranked the TV as \u201Ceasy\u201D to use, 21.6% (8) were undecided, and 10.8% (4) ranked the TV as \u201Cdifficult\u201D to use, whereas 56.8% percent (21) reported that the TV improved their intubation attempts, 27% (10) reported no difference, and 10.8% (4) reported that the TV made the intubation attempts more difficult.

Infants are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy may be effective to prevent pertussis in young infants, but population-based estimates of disease burden in infants are lacking, particularly in low-income countries. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of pertussis in infants less than 6 months of age in Sarlahi District, Nepal. METHODS: Nested within a population-based randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, infants were visited weekly from birth through 6 months to assess respiratory illness in the prior week. If any respiratory symptoms had occurred, a nasal swab was collected and tested with a multitarget pertussis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The prospective cohort study includes infants observed between May 2011 and August 2014. RESULTS: The incidence of PCR-confirmed Bordetella pertussis was 13.3 cases per 1000 infant-years (95% confidence interval, 7.7\u201321.3) in a cohort of 3483 infants with at least 1 day of follow-up.

This review introduces two promising platforms based on virus-like particle and liposome, and discusses the methodologies and challenges.","publish_time":"2017-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charlton Hume, Hayley K.; Lua, Linda H.L.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89cc2ef7c7a14872165080ac0ad1b559b067948c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115529.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17303651; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17303651; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28347504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modular vaccine platforms","traditional vaccine manufacturing","modern vaccine design","promising platforms","sophisticated approach","issues","designed peptide","interaction","potential","effective tool","Abstract Improved understanding of antigenic components","computational tools","immune system","virus","protein antigens","liposome","particle","safe vaccines","methodologies","review"],"language":"en"},

The selection of wavebands, spectra pretreated method and the number of latent variables were optimized to obtain better results. The quantitative calibration models were established with 3 different PLS regression algorithms, named linear PLS, non-linear PLS and concentration weighted PLS, and the net result was defined as the average of the predicted values of the different calibration models. The overall results indicated that the presented method is more powerful than single multivariable regression method, characterized by higher mean recovery rate (MRR) of the validation set, and can be used for the rapid determination of TOC and SSC values of Tanreqing injection intermediates, which are two important quality indicators for the process monitoring.","publish_time":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wenlong; Qu, Haibin","journal":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba9a84afa5518bb1248f69b0f026ac88838bfb41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114577.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2015.12.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287621/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169743915003330; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169743915003330","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSC","NIR","Multi N/C UV HS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-linear PLS","drying method","presented method","SSC values of Tanreqing injection intermediates","SSC reference values","different calibration models","different PLS regression algorithms","concentration weighted PLS","single multivariable regression method","predicted values","rapid determination of TOC","quantitative calibration models","validation sets","Dixon test","NIR spectra","better results","overall results","studentized residual test","fast determination of total organic carbon","Multi N","C UV HS analyzer","chemometrics","MRR","loss","soluble solids contents","higher mean recovery rate","important quality indicators","Kennard","Stone","leverage","net result","transflective mode","number of latent variables","Abstract Near infrared spectroscopy","process monitoring","average","KS","sample outlier analysis","selection of wavebands","samples"],"language":"en"},

Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (Influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury, however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection. There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19. These utilise a range of different cell sources, doses, dosing strategies, and targeted patient populations.

This chapter reviews several strategies that aim at counteracting the adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies. The proposed designs are based on combinations of different antiviral drugs and immune modulators, or in the administration of virus-specific mutagenic agents, in an approach termed lethal mutagenesis of viruses. It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins sub-optimal or non-functional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intra-population interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters. Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the chapter closes with some optimistic prospects for an effective control of viruses displaying error-prone replication, based on the combined targeting of replication fidelity and the induction of the innate immune response.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virus as Populations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e041dfe29eb6c7e684b4053c9cde60f2434d883.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149557.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128008379000095; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128008379000095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral extinction","viral fitness","viral disease control","Abstract Viral populations","antiviral designs","viral proteins sub-optimal","adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies","antiviral interventions","lethal mutagenesis of viruses","combinations of different antiviral drugs","effective control of viruses","immune modulators","different fields","proposed designs","error-prone replication","innate immune response","combined targeting of replication fidelity","genetic information stability","true moving targets","major concepts of intra-population interactions","induction","approach","need of new paradigms","excess of mutations","genomic sequences","specific mutagenic agents","administration of virus","optimistic prospects","preceding chapters","steps","magnitude","challenge","strategies","Experts"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this first-in-man study was to determine the effect of delta inulin adjuvant on the safety and immunogenicity of a reduced dose seasonal influenza vaccine. Healthy male and female adults aged 18\u201365 years were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled study to compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a reduced-dose 2007 Southern Hemisphere trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine formulated with Advax\u2122 delta inulin adjuvant (LTIV \u002B Adj) when compared to a full-dose of the standard TIV vaccine which does not contain an adjuvant. LTIV \u002B Adj provided equivalent immunogenicity to standard TIV vaccine as assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays against each vaccine strain as well as against a number of heterosubtypic strains. HI responses were sustained at 3 months post-immunisation in both groups. Antibody landscapes against a large panel of H3N2 influenza viruses showed distinct age effects whereby subjects over 40 years old had a bimodal baseline HI distribution pattern, with the highest HI titers against the very oldest H3N2 isolates and with a second HI peak against influenza isolates from the last 5\u201310 years. By contrast, subjects \u003E40 years had a unimodal baseline HI distribution with peak recognition of H3N2 isolates from approximately 20 years ago. The reduced dose TIV vaccine containing Advax adjuvant was well tolerated and no safety issues were identified.

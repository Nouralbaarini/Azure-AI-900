The aim of this study was to decipher clinical and laboratory characteristics of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after definite diagnosis of liver failure and to provide clues for early diagnosis and treatment of HLH in patients with liver failure. Eleven patients diagnosed with liver failure and HLH were retrospectively investigated in this study. All patients presented with jaundice, persistent high-grade fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, evidence of hemophagocytes in the bone marrow and laboratory abnormalities indicating HLH. The average interval from the earliest diagnosis of liver failure to a definitive diagnosis of HLH was 17.27 days. Six (54.55%) patients died during follow-up. For patients with liver failure after admission and subsequently definitively diagnosed with HLH, bilirubin and INR were significantly decreased. HLH is definitely diagnosed at an intermediate or late stage when patients have already suffered from liver failure. The initial dose of glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone) was decreased to 1\u20131.5 mg/kg/d and gradually reduced thereafter. In conclusion, for patients with liver failure, HLH should be screened as early as possible upon persistent fever, splenomegaly and unexplained pancytopenia. For patients with liver failure and HLH, the dosage of glucocorticoid should be reduced to avoid serious side effects.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Jinling; Xie, Fang; Jia, Lin; Li, Juan; Hu, Zhongjie; Zhu, Yueke; Yu, Hongwei; Zhao, Yujuan; Yao, Qinwei; Meng, Qinghua","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5928db30526f18fa51e7e0aebc5cad6327cf37ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6544643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6544643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","definite diagnosis of liver failure","earliest diagnosis of liver failure","treatment of HLH","definitive diagnosis of HLH","early diagnosis","splenomegaly","persistent fever","study","laboratory characteristics of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","persistent high-grade fever","laboratory abnormalities","unexplained pancytopenia","dosage of glucocorticoid","initial dose of glucocorticoid","evidence of hemophagocytes","bone marrow","jaundice","clues","life-threatening syndrome","admission","average interval","high mortality","methylprednisolone","late stage","days","conclusion","bilirubin","INR","effects","aim","follow-up"],"language":"en"},

Considering an earthquake-prone country, Iran is ranked as one of the world\u0027s most dangerous countries OBJECTIVE: In this article, we describe the actions taken by emergency medical service (EMS) after the earthquake in Kermanshah, Varzaghan, and Bam and compared the strengths and weaknesses of the emergency response program and the limitations and challenges of this system in dealing with these major crises. METHOD: This study is a cross-sectional study that compares some of the information and findings related to three earthquakes that occurred in Iran, including Bam, Varzaghan and Sarpol-e-Zahab earthquakes. The data reported in the present article is descriptive and is based on various independent sources such as National Emergency Operation Center, Local Emergency Operations Center (EOC), the EMS of the country, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the statistics website, the Forensic Data website, the International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering, conferences and personal interviews. To ensure the credibility of the information, the authors reported data that had been verified by two or more sources. RESULTS: The characteristics of the geographic area of the 3 earthquakes has been described. Post-earthquake response activities were described in details in subheadings including rapid warning and response, surge capacity plan, rapid response teams, emergency medical teams, increasing the capacity of health facilities, increasing transfer capacity, and handling, transportation and distribution of injuries. CONCLUSION: In the recent earthquake, had been occurred in Sarpol-e-Zahab, the health response of the country was largely satisfactory. The existence of structures such as EOC at various levels, the unified incident command system, emergency operations plan, and Medical Care Monitoring Center are among the most important reasons for satisfactory performance.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saberian, Peyman; Kolivand, Pir-Hossein; Hasani-Sharamin, Parisa; Dadashi, Fatemeh; Farhoud, Amir Reza","journal":"Adv J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3061f05203159384dfbb2fd9b1d9a1ca7b98c8a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6548112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS","National Emergency Operation Center, Local Emergency Operations Center","World Health Organization","United Nations","EOC"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["emergency response program","health response","emergency medical teams","Earthquake Engineering","recent earthquake","emergency operations plan","emergency medical service","earthquake-prone country","Post-earthquake response activities","Local Emergency Operations Center","rapid response teams","National Emergency Operation Center","Zahab earthquakes","capacity of health facilities","surge capacity plan","transfer capacity","Medical Care Monitoring Center","EOC","Forensic Data website","EMS","Sarpol-e","information","Varzaghan","Iran","World Health Organization","various independent sources","rapid warning","statistics website","various levels","present article","cross-sectional study","satisfactory performance","major crises","natural catastrophic crises","unified incident command system","International Institute of Seismology","United Nations","details","handling","transportation","conferences","subheadings","limitations","important reasons","dangerous countries OBJECTIVE","personal interviews","challenges","weaknesses","actions","geographic area","characteristics","world\u0027s","distribution of injuries","existence of structures","authors","Kermanshah","strengths","RESULTS","lot of casualties","METHOD","credibility","CONCLUSION","findings","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

To date, it is unknown how these components are coordinated in space and time. Here, we studied plasma membrane dynamics of CD151 and EGFR and the HPV16 capsid during the early phase of infection. We find that the proteinase ADAM17 activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway by the shedding of growth factors which triggers the formation of an endocytic entry platform. Infectious endocytic entry platforms carrying virus particles consist of two-fold larger CD151 domains containing the EGFR.

Thus, understanding host\u2013microbe interactions is vital. Many of these microorganisms may have no or limited contact with the host, while most of those interacting more meaningfully with the host will be dealt with by the innate immune response. Fundamentally, poultry have evolved to have immune responses that are generally appropriate and adequate for their acquired microbiomes, although this is challenged by commercial production practices. Innate immune cells and their functions, encompassing inflammatory responses, create the context for neutralising the stimulus and initiating resolution. Dysregulated inflammatory responses can be detrimental but, being a highly conserved biological process, inflammation is critical for host defence. Heterogeneity and functional plasticity of innate immune cells is underappreciated and offers the potential for (gut) health interventions, perhaps including exogenous opportunities to influence immune cell metabolism and thus function. New approaches could focus on identifying and enhancing decisive but less harmful immune processes, improving the efficiency of innate immune cells (e.g., targeted, efficient microbial killing) and promoting phenotypes that drive resolution of inflammation. Breeding strategies and suitable exogenous interventions offer potential solutions to enhance poultry gut health, performance and welfare.","publish_time":"2019-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broom, Leon J.","journal":"Microorganisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0477047b8738ac46e2ac33133129f61a9ea3a41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6560434.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560434/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune responses","innate immune response","efficiency of innate immune cells","functional plasticity of innate immune cells","immune cell metabolism","harmful immune processes","Commercial poultry","host defence","poultry gut health","health interventions","Dysregulated inflammatory responses","resolution of inflammation","microorganisms","suitable exogenous interventions","potential solutions","exogenous opportunities","initiating resolution","commercial production practices","phenotypes","functions","conserved biological process","mucosal surfaces","Breeding strategies","context","performance","welfare","Heterogeneity","efficient microbial killing","intestinal mucosa","acquired microbiomes","stimulus","microbe interactions","limited contact","New approaches"],"language":"en"},

Despite major efforts, there are no vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions against this virus. Chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY)-based passive immunization has been shown to be an effective strategy to prevent and treat many enteric viral diseases. Here, we developed a highly efficient bioreactor to generate high titers of HuNoV-specific IgY in chicken yolks using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing HuNoV capsid protein (rVSV-VP1) as an antigen. We first demonstrated that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed in chicken cells infected by rVSV-VP1. Subsequently, we found that White Leghorn hens immunized intramuscularly with rVSV-VP1 triggered a high level of HuNoV-specific yolk IgY antibodies. The purified yolk IgY was efficiently recognized by HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs). Importantly, HuNoV-specific IgY efficiently blocked the binding of HuNoV VLPs to all three types (A, B, and O) of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), the attachment factors for HuNoV. In addition, the receptor blocking activity of IgY remained stable at temperature below 70 \u00B0C and at pH ranging from 4 to 9. Thus, immunization of hens with VSV-VP1 could be a cost-effective and practical strategy for large-scale production of anti-HuNoV IgY antibodies for potential use as prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against HuNoV infection.","publish_time":"2019-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Yang; Ma, Yuanmei; Lu, Mijia; Zhang, Yu; Li, Anzhong; Liang, Xueya; Li, Jianrong","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1efb6bb6211fc7190f9e06ac0929d340e7aafa1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6563233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6563233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["White Leghorn"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HuNoV virus","HuNoV-specific","HuNoV VP1 protein","HuNoV infection","HuNoV capsid protein","high level of HuNoV","high titers of HuNoV","binding of HuNoV VLPs","rVSV-VP1","large-scale production of anti-HuNoV","specific yolk","antibodies","chicken yolks","chicken cells","effective strategy","immunization of hens","effective therapeutic interventions","Chicken immunoglobulin Y","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","therapeutic treatment","practical strategy","purified yolk","passive immunization","White Leghorn hens","prophylactic","potential use","HBGAs","histo-blood group antigens","vaccines","activity","efficient bioreactor","attachment factors","outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis","receptor","temperature","Human norovirus","types","particles","enteric viral diseases","addition","major efforts"],"language":"en"},

At the outset, mass-gathering events provide challenging settings to plan a suitable emergency public health response. Published studies basically talk about retrospective reviews, case studies of the public health preparedness, or health care provided at individual events. Developing an understanding of the variables associated with MGs is the first step for public health managers. Risk assessment (RA) is a crucial part of pre-event planning as it helps foresee potential risks. Based on RA, one can develop preventive measures and ensure that the infrastructure to control the potential problems is in place. This study is an attempt to systemize RA process during MG events in a country that is culturally rich but with poor resources to handle such events. A RA tool will be developed for planning and management of religious MG events of India. METHODS/DESIGN: Various strategies will be used to develop the risk assessment tool (RA tool). Extensive review of literature clubbed with key informant interviews will be done in order to identify the risk variables and decide the domains and items of the tool. Further, this tool will be developed as a mobile-based application. The feasibility of the mobile-based RA tool will be tested in real-time MG event in one part of the country. Concurrently in the same event, a community survey of residents and visitors will be done in order to assess public perceptions of public health and environmental risks associated with MG events. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will provide insights into the public health and environmental concerns that need to be considered if preventive strategies and intervention programs are to be designed for MG events. A \u201CRA Tool,\u201D which can be used in the planning and management of MG events by the public health managers will strengthen the existing health systems preparedness plans for MGs.","publish_time":"2019-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Upasana; Desikachari, B.

These antiviral cytokines have evolved remarkable molecular and functional diversity to confront ever-evolving viral threats and physiological regulation. We have annotated IFN gene families across 110 animal genomes, and showed that IFN genes, after originating in jawed fishes, had several significant evolutionary surges in vertebrate species of amphibians, bats and ungulates, particularly pigs and cattle. For example, pigs have the largest but still expanding type I IFN family consisting of nearly 60 IFN-coding genes that encode seven IFN subtypes including multigene subtypes of IFN-\u03B1, -\u03B4, and -\u03C9. Whereas, subtypes such as IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B2 have been widely studied in many species, the unconventional subtypes such as IFN-\u03C9 have barely been investigated. We have cross-species defined the IFN evolution, and shown that unconventional IFN subtypes particularly the IFN-\u03C9 subtype have evolved several novel features including: (1) being a signature multi-gene subtype expanding primarily in mammals such as bats and ungulates, (2) emerging isoforms that have superior antiviral potency than typical IFN-\u03B1, (3) highly cross-species antiviral (but little anti-proliferative) activity exerted in cells of humans and other mammalian species, and (4) demonstrating potential novel molecular and functional properties. This study focused on IFN-\u03C9 to investigate the immunogenetic evolution and functional diversity of unconventional IFN subtypes, which may further IFN-based novel antiviral design pertinent to their cross-species high antiviral and novel activities.","publish_time":"2019-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shields, Lauren E.; Jennings, Jordan; Liu, Qinfang; Lee, Jinhwa; Ma, Wenjun; Blecha, Frank; Miller, Laura C.; Sang, Yongming","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ed23e6fe433d2ce14436eaa68a9ab6240a00500.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6603160.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN evolution","IFN genes","IFN family","multigene subtypes of IFN","IFN-\u03C9 subtype","typical IFN-\u03B1","IFN-coding genes","functional diversity of unconventional IFN subtypes","cross-species antiviral","annotated IFN gene families","unconventional subtypes","animal antiviral","cross-species high antiviral","antiviral cytokines","mammalian species","novel antiviral design pertinent","superior antiviral potency","vertebrate species of amphibians","novel activities","novel features","ungulates","functional properties","IFNs","bats","pigs","cell-proliferative activity","animal genomes","immunogenetic evolution","signature multi-gene subtype","significant evolutionary surges","jawed fishes","emerging isoforms","cells of humans","mammals","primary mediators","viral threats","physiological regulation","Innate immune interferons","example","cattle","study"],"language":"en"},

Currently, circulating virulent genotype II Armenia/07-like viruses cause fatal disease in pigs and wild boar, whereas attenuated strains induce infections with various levels of chronic illness. Sensing cytosolic dsDNA, mainly by the key DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), leads to the synthesis of type I interferon and involves signaling through STING, TBK1, and IRF3. After phosphorylation, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment and to the perinuclear region, acting as an indispensable adaptor connecting the cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway. We demonstrate here that attenuated NH/P68, but not virulent Armenia/07, activates the cGAS-STING-IRF3 cascade very early during infection, inducing STING phosphorylation and trafficking through a mechanism involving cGAMP. Both TBK1 and IRF3 are subsequently activated and, in response to this, a high level of beta interferon (IFN-\u03B2) was produced during NH/P68 infection; in contrast, Armenia/07 infection generated IFN-\u03B2 levels below those of uninfected cells. Our results show that virulent Armenia/07 ASFV controls the cGAS-STING pathway, but these mechanisms are not at play when porcine macrophages are infected with attenuated NH/P68 ASFV. These findings show for the first time the involvement of the cGAS-STING-IRF3 route in ASFV infection, where IFN-\u03B2 production or inhibition was found after infection by attenuated or virulent ASFV strains, respectively, thus reinforcing the idea that ASFV virulence versus attenuation may be a phenomenon grounded in ASFV-mediated innate immune modulation where the cGAS-STING pathway might play an important role. IMPORTANCE African swine fever, a devastating disease for domestic pigs and wild boar, is currently spreading in Europe, Russia, and China, becoming a global threat with huge economic and ecological consequences. One interesting aspect of ASFV biology is the molecular mechanism leading to high virulence of some strains compared to more attenuated strains, which produce subclinical infections. In this work, we show that the presently circulating virulent Armenia/07 virus blocks the synthesis of IFN-\u03B2, a key mediator between the innate and adaptive immune response. Armenia/07 inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway by impairing STING activation during infection. In contrast, the cGAS-STING pathway is efficiently activated during NH/P68 attenuated strain infection, leading to the production of large amounts of IFN-\u03B2. Our results show for the first time the relationship between the cGAS-STING pathway and ASFV virulence, contributing to uncover the molecular mechanisms of ASFV virulence and to the rational development of ASFV vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Belmonte, Raquel; P\u00E9rez-N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Daniel; Pittau, Marco; Richt, Juergen A.; Revilla, Yolanda","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2544d85288aa39f592b1e172f8c62040bc1b2ba6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6613762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6613762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NH/P68 ASFV","ASFV"],"locations":["Europe","Russia","China"],"keyphrases":["ASFV infection","cGAS-STING pathway","P68 ASFV","virulent ASFV strains","STING phosphorylation","P68 infection","virulent Armenia","attenuated strains","attenuated NH","molecular mechanisms of ASFV virulence","P68 attenuated strain infection","impairing STING activation","IFN-\u03B2 levels","IFN-\u03B2 production","TBK1-IRF3","synthesis of IFN","rational development of ASFV vaccines","interesting aspect of ASFV biology","high virulence","IRF3 route","IRF3 cascade","virulent genotype","production of large amounts of IFN","African swine fever virus","wild boar","cytosolic detection of DNA","cytosolic dsDNA","contrast","time","play","results","IMPORTANCE African swine fever","innate immune modulation","adaptive immune response","devastating disease","fatal disease","key mediator","cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA","domestic pigs","high level of beta interferon","subclinical infections","synthesis of type","key DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase","various levels of chronic illness","complex","global threat","Golgi compartment","indispensable adaptor","trafficking","perinuclear region","ecological consequences","endoplasmic reticulum","porcine macrophages","China","viruses","attenuation","phenomenon","inhibition","relationship","Europe","uninfected cells","idea","important role","involvement","Russia","cGAMP","findings","world","work"],"language":"en"},

Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialised cells responsible for sampling antigens and presenting them to T cells, which also play an essential role in recognising and neutralising viruses. Recent studies have suggested that non-coding RNAs may regulate the functional program of DCs. Expression of host non-coding RNAs changes markedly during infectious bronchitis virus infection, but their role in regulating host immune function has not been explored. Here, microarrays of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs were globally performed to analyse how avian DCs respond to IBV. RESULTS: First, we found that IBV stimulation did not enhance the maturation ability of avian DCs. Interestingly, inactivated IBV was better able than IBV to induce DC maturation and activate lymphocytes. We identified 1093 up-regulated and 845 down-regulated mRNAs in IBV-infected avian DCs. Gene Ontology analysis suggested that cellular macromolecule and protein location (GO-BP) and transcription factor binding (GO-MF) were abundant in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. Meanwhile, pathway analysis indicated that the oxidative phosphorylation and leukocyte transendothelial migration signalling pathways might be activated in the IBV group. Moreover, alteration of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was detected in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. In total, 19 significantly altered (7 up and 12 down) miRNAs and 101 (75 up and 26 down) lncRNAs were identified in the IBV-treated group. Further analysis showed that the actin cytoskeleton and MAPK signal pathway were related to the target genes of IBV-stimulated miRNAs. Finally, our study identified 2 TF-microRNA and 53 TF\u2013microRNA\u2013mRNA interactions involving 1 TF, 2 miRNAs, and 53 mRNAs in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests a new mechanism to explain why IBV actively blocks innate responses needed for inducing immune gene expression and also provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of avian IBV.

We report a child who died of FVH upon infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) at age 11 yr and who was homozygous for a private 40-nucleotide deletion in IL18BP, which encodes the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). This mutation is loss-of-function, unlike the variants found in a homozygous state in public databases. We show that human IL-18 and IL-18BP are both secreted mostly by hepatocytes and macrophages in the liver. Moreover, in the absence of IL-18BP, excessive NK cell activation by IL-18 results in uncontrolled killing of human hepatocytes in vitro. Inherited human IL-18BP deficiency thus underlies fulminant HAV hepatitis by unleashing IL-18. These findings provide proof-of-principle that FVH can be caused by single-gene inborn errors that selectively disrupt liver-specific immunity. They also show that human IL-18 is toxic to the liver and that IL-18BP is its antidote.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belkaya, Serkan; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Korol, Cecilia B.; Kabbani, Mohammad; Cobat, Aur\u00E9lie; Bastard, Paul; Lee, Yoon Seung; Hernandez, Nicholas; Drutman, Scott; de Jong, Ype P.; Vivier, Eric; Bruneau, Julie; B\u00E9ziat, Vivien; Boisson, Bertrand; Lorenzo-Diaz, Lazaro; Boucherit, Soraya; Sebagh, Myl\u00E8ne; Jacquemin, Emmanuel; Emile, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Abel, Laurent; Rice, Charles M.; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Casanova, Jean-Laurent","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f048d83adc004dcc6a84fec5fae2b320de51de1a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b17965f78cdb89a23537c972dbc60f3828cf6bc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6683989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6683989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FVH","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unleashing IL","absence of IL","Inherited human IL","BP deficiency","FVH","fulminant HAV hepatitis","Fulminant viral hepatitis","uncontrolled killing of human hepatocytes","liver-specific immunity","common liver-tropic viruses","primary infection","homozygous state","results","healthy individuals","excessive NK cell activation","unexplained condition","single-gene inborn errors","IL18BP","binding protein","nucleotide deletion","function","variants","public databases","proof","principle","yr","mutation","loss","findings","child","macrophages","antidote"],"language":"en"},

Accurate and rapid recognition of associated life-threatening conditions is paramount for timely treatment. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to impact the diagnosis of dyspnea presentations in resource-rich settings, and may be of greater diagnostic benefit in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a convenience sample of 100 patients presenting with dyspnea in the Emergency Department at University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (UTH-K) in Rwanda. After a traditional history and physical exam, the primary treating team listed their 3 main diagnoses and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1\u20135). Multi-organ ultrasound scans performed by a separate physician sonographer assessed the heart, lungs, inferior vena cava, and evaluated for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis or features of disseminated tuberculosis. The sonographer reviewed the findings with the treating team, who then listed 3 diagnoses post-ultrasound and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1\u20135). The hospital diagnosis at discharge was used as the standard in determining the accuracy of the pre- and post-ultrasound diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 99 patients included in analysis, 57.6% (n = 57) were male, with a mean age of 45 years. Most of them had high-level acuity (54.5%), the dyspnea was of acute onset (45.5%) and they came from district hospitals (50.5%). The most frequent discharge diagnoses were acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) (26.3%) and pneumonia (21.2%). Ultrasound changed the leading diagnosis in 66% of cases. The diagnostic accuracy for ADHF increased from 53.8 to 100% (p = 0.0004), from 38 to 85.7% for pneumonia (p = 0.0015), from 14.2 to 85.7% for extrapulmonary tuberculosis (p = 0.0075), respectively, pre and post-ultrasound. The overall physician diagnostic accuracy increased from 34.7 to 88.8% pre and post- ultrasound. The clinician confidence in the leading diagnosis changed from a mean of 3.5 to a mean of 4.7 (Likert scale 0\u20135) (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In dyspneic patients presenting to this Emergency Department, ultrasound frequently changed the leading diagnosis, significantly increased clinicians\u2019 confidence in the leading diagnoses, and improved diagnostic accuracy.","publish_time":"2019-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Umuhire, Olivier Felix; Henry, Michael B.; Levine, Adam Carl; Cattermole, Giles N.; Henwood, Patricia","journal":"Ultrasound J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26e33b311a11a95aea2913d9957f6c702abf7776.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6702246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6702246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emergency Department"],"locations":["Rwanda"],"keyphrases":["leading diagnosis","post- ultrasound","post-ultrasound diagnoses","leading diagnoses","confidence accuracy","hospital diagnosis","diagnosis of dyspnea presentations","complexity of diagnosis","care ultrasound","improved diagnostic accuracy","overall physician diagnostic accuracy","emergency department","main diagnoses","Likert scale","Multi-organ ultrasound scans","frequent discharge diagnoses","increased clinicians\u2019 confidence","clinician confidence","ill dyspnea presentations","greater diagnostic benefit","dyspneic patients","mean age","ADHF","pneumonia","resource-limited settings","primary treating team","resource-rich settings","separate physician sonographer","acute decompensated heart failure","acute onset","extrapulmonary tuberculosis","features of disseminated tuberculosis","University Teaching Hospital of Kigali","rapid recognition of associated life-threatening conditions","lower extremity deep vein thrombosis","physical exam","lungs","UTH","inferior vena cava","timely treatment","traditional history","male","convenience sample","findings","analysis","years","CONCLUSIONS","Point","POCUS","BACKGROUND","challenge","standard","cases","high-level acuity","district hospitals","METHODS","Rwanda","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Dynamic formation of SINT-speckles is positively controlled by the acetyltransferase KAT2A (GCN5) and antagonized by heat shock protein-mediated chaperone activity. SINT-speckle formation is also inhibited by the autophagy-initiating kinases ULK1/2, and knockdown of these kinases prevented focal TBK1 phosphorylation in a pathway-specific manner.

This study seeks to explain the responses of monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of EEHV-HD. Samples of blood, frozen tissues, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from EEHV1A-HD, EEHV4-HD, co-infected EEHV1A and 4-HD, and EEHV-negative calves were analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the persistent EEHV4-infected and EEHV-negative calves were also studied. The results showed increased infiltration of Iba-1-positive macrophages in the inflamed tissues of the internal organs of elephant calves with EEHV-HD. In addition, cellular apoptosis also increased in the tissues of elephants with EEHV-HD, especially in the PBMCs, compared to the EEHV-negative control. In the PBMCs of persistent EEHV4-infected elephants, cytokine mRNA expression was high, particularly up-regulation of TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3. Moreover, viral particles were observed in the cytoplasm of the persistent EEHV4-infected elephant monocytes.

This study aimed to determine the occurrence of one or both viruses, the risk factors associated with infection, and to develop further recommendations. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Veterinary Faculty of Eduardo Mondlane University, Mozambique, between March and December 2017, in 145 cats. From each of 145 cats, we took 1.5 ml of blood by jugular puncture for detection of antibodies to FIV and FeLV antigens in whole blood using a commercial test kit, DFV Test FeLV/FIV. RESULTS: We found an overall prevalence of 11.0% and 14.5% for FIV antibodies and FeLV antigens, respectively, with four (2.8%) cats coinfected by both pathogens. Male cats were more likely to be infected with FIV (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3\u20134.0) compared with female cats. Clinically ill cats were more likely to have a positive result for FeLV antigen infection (OR 18.8, 95% CI 5.2\u201368.3). Moreover, cats living in suburban areas have a greater chance of a positive result for FeLV infection (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4\u20139.6) compared with cats living in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: FIV and FeLV occur in cats from Maputo and possibly all over the country. Further studies should be conducted in Mozambique and other African countries to define the burden of both pathogens in cats, coinfection with other zoonotic pathogens and the possible role played by the cats on the transmission of zoonotic and opportunistic diseases to humans.","publish_time":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tchamo, Cesaltina CLM; De Rugeriis, M\u00F3nica; Noormahomed, Em\u00EDlia V","journal":"JFMS Open Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91bf77728f819af91ffed7f116dd2da12a1bd2a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6737869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6737869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFV Test FeLV/FIV"],"locations":["Maputo","Mozambique"],"keyphrases":["ill cats","female cats","FeLV infection","FeLV antigens","FIV antibodies","FeLV antigen infection","zoonotic pathogens","DFV Test FeLV","positive result","blood","transmission of zoonotic","Mozambique","feline leukaemia virus","Feline immunodeficiency virus","detection of antibodies","immunosuppressive viruses","suburban areas","cross-sectional study","commercial test kit","Veterinary Faculty of Eduardo Mondlane University","greater chance","jugular puncture","opportunistic diseases","OBJECTIVES","burden","possible role","susceptibility","coinfection","African countries","humans","risk factors","CONCLUSIONS","RELEVANCE","Maputo","confidence interval","odds ratio","RESULTS","overall prevalence","METHODS","occurrence","country","studies","recommendations"],"language":"en"},

We manually coded the 30 tweets with the highest number of retweets for each cycle, whether it contained visual cues (images or videos). Univariable negative binomial regression models were applied to compute the prevalence ratio (PR) of retweet frequency for each cycle, between tweets with and without visual cues. FINDINGS: URL links increased retweet frequency in both corpora; effects of hashtag count and mention count differed between the two corpora. Of the 58 #CDCGrandRounds cycles, 29 were found to have statistically significantly different retweet frequencies between tweets with and without visual cues. Of these 29 cycles, one had a PR estimate \u003C 1; twenty-four, PR \u003E 1 but \u003C 3; and four, PR \u003E 3. Of the 42 #VitalSigns cycles, 19 were statistically significant. Of these 19 cycles, six were PR \u003E 1 and \u003C 3; and thirteen, PR \u003E 3. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of retweet frequency through attaching visual cues varied across cycles for original tweets with #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns. Future research is needed to determine the optimal choice of visual cues to maximize the influence of public health tweets.","publish_time":"2018-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, Ashley M.; Mullican, Lindsay A.; Yin, Jingjing; Ho Tse, Zion Tsz; Liang, Hai; Fu, King-Wa; Ahweyevu, Jennifer O.; Jenkins, Jimmy J.; Saroha, Nitin; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05252b1035b0647c566b72ef0ef269f3fc385c90.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fb4ca5437ec6856a1f57ece571120c64f17b13ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6748269.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6748269/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","Vital Signs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VitalSigns tweets","CDCGrandRounds cycles","VitalSigns cycles","URL count","mention count","effects of hashtag count","effect of hashtag count","attaching visual cues","original tweets","increase of retweet frequency","URL link count","PR estimate","optimal choice of visual cues","URL links increased retweet frequency","influence of public health tweets","different retweet frequencies","corpora","corpus","Univariable negative binomial regression models","monthly reports","Public Health Grand Rounds\u2019","monthly panel presentations","Twitter Search Application Programming Interface","predictors","FINDINGS","METHODS","highest number of retweets","study","associations","sub-set","prevalence ratio","Vital Signs","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","images","videos","OBJECTIVES","Hashtags","Future research"],"language":"en"},

Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between postnatal gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h after birth, with or without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (\u003E1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to one of four treatments: 1) suckled by sow (S, n = 8); 2) suckled by sow plus administration of a fat supplement (SF, n = 5); 3) bottle-fed solely milk replacer (B, n = 8); or 4) bottle-fed solely milk replacer plus administration of a fat supplement (BF, n = 7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs of gilts were taken with a cytology brush, and lipids were extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts, milk collected at 24 h from sows, and milk replacer were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids recovered from vaginal swabs that highly distinguished between S and B gilts [area-under-the-curve (AUC) \u003E 0.9], including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbons and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE (34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r \u003E 0.6; p \u003C 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids with greater abundance in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum. Consequently, PE (34:4) was found to have 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p \u003C 0.001), respectively, of B gilts as compared to S gilts. Findings support that vaginal swabs can be used to noninvasively study effects of perinatal nutrition on tissue composition.","publish_time":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harlow, KaLynn; Ferreira, Christina R.; Sobreira, Tiago J.

MD is a chronic infectious disease that threatens the poultry industry. However, the mechanisms of genetic resistance for MD are complex and not completely understood. In this study, to identify high-confidence candidate genes of MD genetic resistance, high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to obtain transcriptomic data of CD4(\u002B) T cells isolated from MDV-infected and non-infected groups of two reciprocal crosses of individuals mating by two highly inbred chicken lines (6(3) MD-resistant and 7(2) MD-susceptible). After RNA-seq analysis with two biological replicates in each group, we identified 61 and 123 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate (FDR) \u003C 0.05) annotated in 39 and 132 genes in intercrosses 6(3) \u00D7 7(2) and 7(2) \u00D7 6(3), respectively, which exhibited allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection. Similarly, we identified 62 and 79 SNPs annotated in 66 and 96 genes in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. We identified 534 and 1543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR \u003C 0.05) related to MDV infection in intercrosses 6(3) \u00D7 7(2) and 7(2) \u00D7 6(3), respectively. We also identified 328 and 20 DEGs in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. The qRT-PCR using seven DEGs further verified our results of RNA-seq analysis. The qRT-PCR of 11 important ASE genes was performed for gene functional validation in CD4(\u002B) T cells and tumors. Combining the analyses, six genes (MCL1, SLC43A2, PDE3B, ADAM33, BLB1, and DMB2), especially MCL1, were highlighted as the candidate genes with the potential to be involved in MDV infection. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that many ASE genes are linked to T cell activation, T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathways, which play potentially important roles in MDV infection. Our approach underlines the importance of comprehensive functional studies for gaining valuable biological insight into the genetic factors behind MD and other complex traits, and our findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms of MD and disease resistance breeding in poultry.","publish_time":"2019-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bai, Hao; He, Yanghua; Ding, Yi; Carrillo, Jos\u00E9 A.; Selvaraj, Ramesh K.; Zhang, Huanmin; Chen, Jilan; Song, Jiuzhou","journal":"Genes (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82ebbe8f7da98684d3f627254627253f080e09b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6770979.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770979/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marek"],"organizations":["MDV","ASE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MDV-infected","mechanisms of MD","MDV infection","MD-resistant","MD-susceptible","important ASE genes","non-infected groups","high-confidence candidate genes of MD genetic resistance","T cell lymphoma disease","T cell receptor","T cells","T cell activation","disease resistance breeding","RNA-seq analysis","DEGs","mechanisms of genetic resistance","Marek\u2019s disease virus","B cell receptor","chronic infectious disease","genetic factors","results of RNA","enrichment analysis","SNPs","MCL1","FDR","qRT-PCR","intercrosses","gene functional validation","biological replicates","complex traits","important roles","poultry industry","high throughput sequencing","valuable biological insight","transcriptomic data of CD4","importance of comprehensive functional studies","TCR","PI3K","ADAM33","pathways","false discovery rate","findings","ERK","BCR","SLC43A2","PDE3B","reciprocal crosses of individuals","response","additional insights","BLB1","MAPK","single nucleotide polymorphisms","potential","oncogenic \u03B1 herpesvirus","allele-specific expression","AKT-mTOR","chickens","inbred chicken lines","DMB2","approach","study","tumors","analyses"],"language":"en"},

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced in part by the neutrophil NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated the development of pulmonary inflammation in Nox2-deficient (gp91(phox-/y)) mice that was absent in WT mice in a murine model of SIRS. Given this finding, we hypothesized that Nox2 in a resident cell in the lung, specifically the alveolar macrophage, has an essential anti-inflammatory role. Using a murine model of SIRS, we examined whole-lung digests and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) from WT and gp91(phox-/y) mice. Both genotypes demonstrated neutrophil sequestration in the lung during SIRS, but neutrophil migration into the alveolar space was only present in the gp91(phox-/y) mice. Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03B1 gene expression and protein secretion were higher in whole-lung digest from uninjected gp91(phox-/y) mice compared to the WT mice. Gene expression of MIP-1\u03B1, MCP-1, and MIP-2 was upregulated in alveolar macrophages obtained from gp91(phox-/y) mice at baseline compared with WT mice. Further, ex vivo analysis of alveolar macrophages, but not bone marrow-derived macrophages or peritoneal macrophages, demonstrated higher gene expression of MIP-1\u03B1 and MIP-2. Moreover, isolated lung polymorphonuclear neutrophils migrate to BALf obtained from gp91(phox-/y) mice, further providing evidence of a cell-specific anti-inflammatory role for Nox2 in alveolar macrophages. We speculate that Nox2 represses the development of inflammatory lung injury by modulating chemokine expression by the alveolar macrophage.","publish_time":"2018-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Potera, Renee M.; Cao, Mou; Jordan, Lin F.; Hogg, Richard T.; Hook, Jessica S.; Moreland, Jessica G.","journal":"Inflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d18b563ab98fb5d524247e8832d25188705809f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6775637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6775637/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRS","Macrophage"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WT mice","phox","lung digests","analysis of alveolar macrophages","development of inflammatory lung injury","higher gene expression of MIP","uninjected gp91","alveolar space","\u03B1 gene expression","Acute lung injury","peritoneal macrophages","Nox2-deficient","Macrophage inflammatory protein","murine model of SIRS","isolated lung polymorphonuclear neutrophils","marrow-derived macrophages","modulating chemokine expression","BALf","neutrophil migration","neutrophil sequestration","cell-specific anti-inflammatory role","essential anti-inflammatory role","neutrophil NADPH oxidase","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","protein secretion","resident cell","pathogenesis of ALI","development of pulmonary inflammation","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","laboratory","component","evidence","baseline","Reactive oxygen species","ROS","significant morbidity","genotypes","MCP","Previous studies","mortality"],"language":"en"},

While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016\u20132017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R(0) (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barr\u00E9 Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016\u20132017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kobres, Pei-Ying; Chretien, Jean-Paul; Johansson, Michael A.; Morgan, Jeffrey J.; Whung, Pai-Yei; Mukundan, Harshini; Del Valle, Sara Y.; Forshey, Brett M.; Quandelacy, Talia M.; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Viboud, Cecile; Pollett, Simon","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e30d311467bd72abd1a319a9f841158b6b685fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6805005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6805005/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["percent of studies","Eligible studies","ZIKV prediction studies","published predictions","numerous predictive studies","African-specific studies","accessibility of ZIKV predictions","behavioral data","demographic data","sharing of model data","percent of predictions","recent ZIKV pandemic","common data sources","Real-time internet data","Zika pandemic","actionable information","future outbreaks","prediction tools","timeliness","use of preprints","Epidemic forecasting","relevant model code","METHODS","epidemic dynamics","complete reproducibility","epidemic peak","Americas","pathogen genomic information","systematic review","functional use of mathematical modeling","modeling efforts","incorporation of uncertainty","Zika Virus","support of future infectious disease outbreaks","utility of analytical tools","grey literature review","midst of emerging epidemics","evaluation of objectives","outbreak response","days","potential","median","basic reproductive number","social science","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 Syndrome burden","EMBASE","epidemiological phenomena","clarity","INTRODUCTION","PRISMA guidelines","journal publication dates","Deterministic models","stochastic approaches","MEDLINE","independent reviewers","pandemics","substantial room","sexual transmission risk","improvement","eligibility criteria","Spatial spread","populations","CONCLUSIONS","Case count","intervention impact","vector","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Thirty-one (31) formalin-fixed hearts from domestic cats who died of idiopathic cardiomyopathy were randomly selected from pathology archives.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate myocardial tissue for the presence of viral genome from feline panleukopenia virus, herpes virus, calici virus, and corona virus. Hearts were examined using light microscopy for histologic evidence of myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria. Panleukopenia virus was identified by PCR in 10 of 31 cats with cardiomyopathy but in none of the controls.

We prospectively examined immune cell populations in peripheral blood taken at baseline of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Len-dex) therapy and reviewed clinical and microbiology records in 90 patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM). Risk factors for infection were analyzed using logistic regression. During a median of 11 cycles of Len-dex treatment, 52 (57.8%) patients experienced at least 1 infection episode. Of a total of 92 episodes of infection, 58 (63%) episodes were clinically defined, 29 (31.5%) episodes were microbiologically defined, and 5 (5.4%) episodes were fever of unknown origin. Severe episodes were more frequently observed during the first 3 cycles. After adjusting for risk factors for infection based on univariate analyses, multivariate analyses showed that lower Hb (\u003C 10 g/dL) was a clinically independent factor associated with occurrence of infections. Lower frequency (P = 0.044) and absolute count (P = 0.014) of circulating CD3(\u002B)CD4(\u002B)CD161(\u002B) cells prior to Len-dex treatment were also associated with the occurrence of infection, especially during the first 3 cycles of Len-dex therapy. In addition to several clinical predictive factors, we found that CD3(\u002B)CD4(\u002B)CD161(\u002B) cells may provide additional information for predicting the occurrence of infection in the early period of Len-dex therapy.

In this study, we employed immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to screen for cellular interacting partners of ORF3. Gene ontology analysis of the host interactome highlighted the involvement of ORF3 in endosomal and immune signaling pathways. Among the identified ORF3-interacting proteins, the vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36 (VPS36) was assessed for its role in PEDV replication. VPS36 was found to interact with ORF3 regardless of its GLUE domain. As a result of VPS36\u2013ORF3 interaction, PEDV replication was substantially suppressed in cells overexpressing VPS36. Interestingly, the ORF3 protein expression was diminished in VPS36-overexpressing cells, an effect that could not be restored by treatment of lysosomal inhibitors.

No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an \u201Cactive\u201D comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or \u201Cactive placebo\u201D) for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.

This deleterious disease is marked by infiltration of myelinspecific T cells that attack the protective myelin sheath that surrounds CNS nerve axons. Upon demyelination, saltatory nerve conduction is disrupted, and patients experience neurologic deficiencies. The exact cause for MS remains unknown, although most evidence supports the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development. Epidemiologic evidence supports a role for environmental pathogens, such as viruses, as potentially key contributors to MS induction. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity via several well-studied mechanisms with the most postulated being molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry occurs when T cells specific for peptide epitopes derived from pathogens cross-react with self-epitopes, leading to autoimmune tissue destruction. In this review, we discuss an in vivo virus-induced mouse model of MS developed in our laboratory, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry-induced CNS autoimmunity.","publish_time":"2011-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chastain, Emily M.

This article describes the evolution of LRDI by the author and the insights gained/lessons learned over the past decade. To illustrate the potential power of LRDI, the article emphasizes the relationship between the results of our 2008 LRDI multiple sclerosis (MS) study and a recent demonstration of MS reversal. Lessons learned from the six LRDI medical studies done so far include: \u204E The main operational problem in the author\u0027s LRDI approach is selecting the most important concepts from extremely large volumes of potential discovery retrieval. This is contrary to most published LRDI research, where the discovery focus is searching for rare events. \u204E It is important to have topical specialist(s) working closely with information technologist(s); the topical specialist(s) applies judgment in selecting the most important concepts. \u204E A functional form of the information retrieval query with proximity searching capability provides highly selective filtering for discovery retrieval and core prevention/treatment retrieval; the functional form of the query with proximity searching capability allows the use of full-text for discovery and core prevention/treatment. \u204E Bibliographic coupling (identifying papers that share common references) combined with text-based relationships strengthens selection for potential discovery further. \u204E Having \u2018skin-in-the-game\u2019 (being affected personally) relative to the medical outcome is a strong incentive to do whatever is necessary to solve the research problem. \u204E Hormesis is critical to healing; relatively modest doses of stimuli tend to be beneficial, whereas relatively large doses may be harmful. The synergy of hormetic treatment doses produces effects larger than combinations of individual doses and requires smaller doses when combined; the synergy of hormetic doses allows conversion of megadoses of nutrients typically reported in lab/clinical studies to physiological (food-level) doses and associated increased safety. \u204E Co-promoters (combinations of toxic stimuli required to produce disease symptoms) are extremely important for explaining seemingly conflicting results; if true co-promotion is present, elimination of one of the co-promoters may be adequate for removing symptoms, even though the overall problem persists. \u204E Prior art (potential treatments already published in the literature but not pursued by mainline medicine) may have much to contribute to potentially solve many serious medical problems; much of prior art is overlooked, especially low-tech prior art (e.g., foods, food extracts, herbs, etc.). \u204E Systemic and focused treatments are both necessary components of healing, but neither will be fully, or many times even partially, effective until the cause(s) is identified and removed. Any medical approach that involves administering treatments for chronic and infectious diseases without addressing the cause(s) results in a broad range of outcomes mainly involving substitution of one set of symptoms for another. \u204E Past results of LRDI medical studies showed much overlap among preventatives/systemic treatments for different diseases. Differences will arise mainly in focused treatments, especially those involving high technology. \u204E The central parameters to healing in much medical research are never identified nor reported. Many treatments require a combination of skilled practitioners, cause removal, and immune/neural/endocrine/circulatory systems to be healthy for full effectiveness, yet practitioner skill, degree of cause removal, and immune system et al. health are never reported. A lack of this information does not allow efficacy of different treatments to be compared. Reviews and meta-analyses that compare and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these different treatments without the above critical information being reported are of extremely limited value and credibility. \u204E Finally, the most important deficiency for fully reversing chronic and infectious diseases, as well as rapidly accelerating healing of injuries and wounds, is the credibility and integrity of the medical literature itself, especially in areas that concern commercial and government/political sensitivities. In the evaluation of many concepts that deviated from the norm, it was difficult to ascertain whether the difference was based on solid high-quality research, poor research, or deliberately skewed research.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kostoff, Ronald N.","journal":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b8263ae8606b1f63b675fd0375805c6f4fbb668.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131827.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004016251200039X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2012.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287411/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004016251200039X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Past results of LRDI medical studies","discovery focus","discovery generation","large doses","evolution of LRDI","potential treatments","medical research","potential power of LRDI","published LRDI research","smaller doses","medical approach","prior art","large volumes of potential discovery retrieval","synergy of hormetic doses","author\u0027s LRDI approach","treatment retrieval","synergy of hormetic treatment doses","Abstract Literature-Related Discovery","systemic treatments","focused treatments","medical outcome","combinations of individual doses","modest doses of stimuli","LRDI multiple sclerosis","important concepts","serious medical problems","research problem","information retrieval query","conflicting results","infectious diseases","proximity","core prevention","capability","functional form","clinical studies","different diseases","topical specialist","disease symptoms","necessary components of healing","article","set of symptoms","promoters","lessons","cause","overall problem","combinations of toxic stimuli","main operational problem","food-level","information technologist","food extracts","technical problems","past decade","text-based relationships","recent demonstration of MS reversal","effects larger","study","preventatives","selective filtering","Innovation","overlap","substitution","lab","promotion","nutrients","broad range of outcomes","conversion of megadoses","foods","selection","judgment","papers","elimination","common references","disparate literatures","strong incentive","wealth of knowledge","herbs","increased safety","rare events","insights","Bibliographic coupling","high technology","central parameters","mainline medicine","Hormesis","Differences","skin","game","times","poor research","skewed research","effectiveness","credibility","efficacy of different treatments","degree of cause removal","solid high-quality research","immune system","critical information","practitioner skill","combination of skilled practitioners","wounds","circulatory systems","endocrine","government","areas","medical literature","integrity","difference","conclusions","accelerating healing of injuries","meta-analyses","political sensitivities","health","important deficiency","limited value","concepts","norm","Reviews","evaluation","lack"],"language":"en"},

This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells.

The situation is different in Europe and Australia, where myxomatosis and rabbit hemorrhagic disease are endemic. Advances in epidemiology and virology have led to detection of other lapine viruses that are now recognized as agents of emerging infectious diseases. Rabbit caliciviruses, related to rabbit hemorrhagic disease, are generally avirulent, but lethal variants are being identified in Europe and North America. Enteric viruses including lapine rotavirus, rabbit enteric coronavirus and rabbit astrovirus are being acknowledged as contributors to the multifactorial enteritis complex of juvenile rabbits. Three avirulent leporid herpesviruses are found in domestic rabbits. A fourth highly pathogenic virus designated leporid herpesvirus 4 has been described in Canada and Alaska. This review considers viruses affecting rabbits by their clinical significance. Viruses of major and minor clinical significance are described, and viruses of laboratory significance are mentioned.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kerr, Peter J.; Donnelly, Thomas M.","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73efc9aea409e5b761f806c5ab711069d3b47329.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110462.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094919413000194; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094919413000194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23642871/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvex.2013.02.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America","Europe","Australia","Canada","Alaska"],"keyphrases":["rabbit astrovirus","Rabbit caliciviruses","rabbit fibroma virus","rabbit hemorrhagic disease","Enteric viruses","lapine viruses","cottontail rabbit papillomavirus","feral rabbit populations","Viral diseases of rabbits","domestic rabbits","pet rabbits","Viruses of major","viruses of laboratory significance","myxoma virus","myxomatosis","North America","Europe","minor clinical significance","multifactorial enteritis complex of juvenile rabbits","avirulent leporid herpesviruses","pathogenic virus designated leporid herpesvirus","enteric coronavirus","lapine rotavirus","agents of emerging infectious diseases","Australia","contributors","study oncogenesis","detection","clinicians","epidemiology","virology","situation","lethal variants","Advances","Canada","review","Alaska"],"language":"en"},

Larvae and adults of A. diaperinus were exposed to these technical insecticides diluted in acetone in residual bioassays. A geographic variation in the susceptibility of larvae and adults of A. diaperinus to both insecticides was detected. The larval LC(50) for cypermethrin ranged from 0.43 to 7.33 \u00B5g a.i./cm(2).

However, are they effective? Cordyceps is not studied as systematically for bioactivity as another TCM, Ganoderma. Cordyceps is fascinating per se, especially because of the pathogenic lifestyle on Lepidopteron insects. The combination of the fungus and dead insect has been used as a TCM for centuries. However, the natural fungus has been harvested to the extent that it is an endangered species. The effectiveness has been attributed to the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang and can this be compatible with scientific philosophy? A vast literature exists, some of which is scientific, although others are popular myth, and even hype. Cordyceps sinensis is the most explored species followed by Cordyceps militaris. However, taxonomic concepts were confused until a recent revision, with undefined material being used that cannot be verified. Holomorphism is relevant and contamination might account for some of the activity. The role of the insect has been ignored. Some of the analytical methodologies are poor. Data on the \u201Cold\u201D compound cordycepin are still being published: ergosterol and related compounds are reported despite being universal to fungi. There is too much work on crude extracts rather than pure compounds with water and methanol solvents being over-represented in this respect (although methanol is an effective solvent). Excessive speculation exists as to the curative properties. However, there are some excellent pharmacological data and relating to apoptosis. For example, some preparations are active against cancers or diabetes which should be fully investigated. Polysaccharides and secondary metabolites are of particular interest.

A G2 glycoprotein construct with an extra hydrophobic sequence derived from the N-terminal NSM region was stably retained in the ER, and was unable to be transported to the Golgi complex. The full-length G2 glycoprotein, when expressed on its own, was transported out of the ER and expressed on the cell surface, whereas the G1 and G2 proteins when expressed together are retained in the Golgi complex. A truncated anchor-minus form of the G2 glycoprotein was found to be secreted into the culture medium, but was retained in the Golgi complex when coexpressed with the G1 glycoprotein.

A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (EV71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (CVA6), the main agent for atypical HFMD, also regulates the host cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0/G1-phase. Furthermore, synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral production. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M. Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0/G1 phase entry from G2/M phase, and inhibits G0/G1 exit into S phase. In line with its role to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, P53, P21, and P16 is regulated by CVA6. Finally, the non-structural proteins of CVA6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C , are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0/G1-phase arrest. These findings suggest that CVA6 infection arrested cell cycle in G0/G1-phase via non-structural proteins 3D and 3C, which may provide favorable environments for virus production.","publish_time":"2018-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zengyan; Wang, Yue; Wang, Shaohua; Meng, Xiangling; Song, Fengmei; Huo, Wenbo; Zhang, Shuxia; Chang, Junliang; Li, Jingliang; Zheng, Baisong; Liu, Yanqiu; Zhang, Yahong; Zhang, Wenyan; Yu, Jinghua","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6104138.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2018.00279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["G2/M"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G0","G1-phase arrest","S phase","G1 phase entry","CVA6 infection","host cell cycle","cell cycle synchronization","cell cycle progression","mechanism of cell cycle arrest","non-structural proteins of CVA6","G2","atypical HFMD","typical HFMD outbreaks","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","outbreaks of hand","main agent","virus production","viral production","primary causative agent","cyclinB1","CDK2","cyclinE1","expression of cyclinD1","P53","CDK1","CDK4","foot","protease","enterovirus","cells","results","P21","mouth disease","favorable environments","Recent epidemiological data","clinical symptoms","P16","coxsackievirus","EV71","role","time","replication","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

An epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the transmission route of the infection and to control the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study (Study 1) was conducted on students and teachers of the athletic departments using the swimming pool, and a prospective surveillance (Study 2) was conducted on all students and teachers of the School J. A case was defined as any student and school personnel who developed more than two of the following symptoms from April 10 to July 2, 2017: fever, sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, or headache. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated to compare the attack rates according to potential risk factors. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors for infection in the outbreak. RESULTS: 47 cases were identified: 33 (55.9%) cases occurred among 59 students and teachers in Study 1 and 14 (3.9%) among 362 students and school personnel in Study 2. There were 18 laboratory confirmed adenovirus infection cases. The common symptoms were headache (71.7%), fever (69.6%), rhinorrhea (63.0%), sputum (56.5%), and sore throat (54.3%). 23.9% of the cases were accompanied with diarrhea and 19.6% with eye congestion. None of the cases developed pneumonia. 32.6% of the cases were hospitalized. In Study 1, attack rate in the swimming department was higher than that in others (RR: 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.60). In Study 2, being a member of the shooting department (RR: 20.70; 95% CI: 4.90-87.47) and being a first year high school student (RR: 10.95; 95% CI: 2.90-41.33) were identified as risk factors for the infections. Genetic analyses of the adenoviruses showed 100% identical sequence in homology and confirmed the human adenovirus B55 (HAdV-B55). No adenovirus was detected at examining the water and environment of the swimming pool and dormitory. CONCLUSION: The outbreak is inferred to be occurred via propagated transmission among the students in the same athletic department, while the students with symptoms of respiratory infection continued performing school activities without any restrictions. Infection control measures such as early detection of symptoms of respiratory infection and restriction of group activity are necessary to prevent respiratory infection outbreak in the communal living setting.","publish_time":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Jeongsuk; Lee, Hyerim; Cho, Enhi","journal":"Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6aea56ae2d57157e5a84857bc2c166d6a9a0105.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6609751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270991/; https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2019.51.2.119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["students","adenovirus infection cases","symptoms of respiratory infection","respiratory infection outbreak","school personnel","swimming department","School J","school activities","Infection control measures","swimming pool","physical education school","retrospective cohort study","teachers","CI","year high school student","shooting department","common symptoms","following symptoms","acute respiratory infections","human adenovirus B55","potential risk factors","early detection of symptoms","Disease Control","rhinorrhea","headache","fever","sore throat","HAdV-B55","athletic departments","attack rates","propagated transmission","transmission route","restriction of group activity","Korea Centers","homology","cough","communal living setting","adenoviruses","Prevention","METHODS","environment","water","prospective surveillance","member","identical sequence","MATERIALS","diarrhea","dormitory","cluster","laboratory","confidence interval","Multivariable logistic regression","Relative risks","RRs","eye congestion","Genetic analyses","restrictions","epidemiological investigation","sputum","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","pneumonia","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: An online 42-question multiple choice survey was randomly distributed between April 1, 2020, and April 16, 2020 to various active Emergency Medical Services (EMS) paid personnel in all 50 U.S. states including the District of Columbia (n=192). We approximate a 95% confidence interval (\u00B1 0.07). RESULTS: An overwhelming number of EMS providers report having limited access to N95 respirators, receiving little or no benefits from COVID-19 related work, and report no institutional policy on social distancing practices despite CDC recommendations. For providers who do have access to N95 respirators, 31% report having to use the same mask for 1 week or longer. Approximately \u2153 of the surveyed participants were unsure of when a COVID-19 patient is infectious. The data suggests regular decontamination of EMS equipment after each patient contact is not a regular practice. DISCUSSION: Current practices to educate EMS providers on appropriate response to the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol. Further investigation on whether current EMS practices are contributing to the spread of infection is warranted. The data reveals concerning deficits in COVID-19 related education and administrative protocols which pose as a serious public health concern that should be urgently addressed.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibson, Cody V.; Ventura, Christian A.; Collier, George D.","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8d08122b9c467bcbfd500ca5a328cca39e396dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196380.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368629/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03900; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020307453; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020307453?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Personal Protective Equipment","EMS","Emergency Medical Services","Columbia","CDC"],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["current EMS practices","EMS professionals","EMS response protocol","overwhelming number of EMS providers report","regular decontamination of EMS equipment","Current practices","established COVID","sanitation practices","social distancing practices","N95 respirators","self-report survey questionnaire","institutional policies","institutional policy","limited access","appropriate response","related education","related work","United States","patient contact","regular practice","data reveals","Personal Protective Equipment","question multiple choice survey","availability","PPE","opinions","pandemic","available resources","various active Emergency Medical Services","administrative protocols","deficits","benefits","novel coronavirus","CDC recommendations","personnel","serious public health concern","study","District of Columbia","RESULTS","DISCUSSION","investigation","future patients","surveyed participants","METHODS","mask","spread of infection","confidence interval","week","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

In light of their key roles in signal regulation, deubiquitinases have become a recent focus for therapeutic intervention as a means to regulate protein abundance. This work and recent discoveries of novel deubiquitinases in humans, viruses, and bacteria, provide the impetus for this chapter on methods for evaluating the activities and structures of deubiquitinases. An array of available deubiquitinase substrates for biochemical characterization are presented and their limitations as standalone tools are discussed.

CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV, ubiquitously expressed in tissues and blood, removes NH(2)\u2010terminal dipeptides from proteins with a penultimate Pro or Ala. A large number of human chemokines, including CXCL2, CXCL6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, CCL3L1, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL14, and CCL22, are cleaved by CD26; however, the efficiency is clearly influenced by the amino acids surrounding the cleavage site and although not yet proven, potentially affected by the chemokine concentration and interactions with third molecules. NH(2)\u2010terminal cleavage of chemokines by CD26 has prominent effects on their receptor binding, signaling, and hence, in vitro and in vivo biologic activities. However, rather than having a similar result, the outcome of NH(2)\u2010terminal truncation is highly diverse. Either no difference in activity or drastic alterations in receptor recognition/specificity and hence, chemotactic activity are observed. Analogously, chemokine\u2010dependent inhibition of HIV infection is enhanced (for CCL3L1 and CCL5) or decreased (for CXCL12) by CD26 cleavage. The occurrence of CD26\u2010processed chemokine isoforms in plasma underscores the importance of the in vitro\u2010observed CD26 cleavages. Through modulation of chemokine activity, CD26 regulates leukocyte/tumor cell migration and progenitor cell release from the bone marrow, as shown by use of mice treated with CD26 inhibitors or CD26 knockout mice. As chemokine processing by CD26 has a significant impact on physiologic and pathologic processes, application of CD26 inhibitors to affect chemokine function is currently explored, e.g., as add\u2010on therapy in viral infection and cancer.","publish_time":"2016-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mortier, Anneleen; Gouwy, Mieke; Van Damme, Jo; Proost, Paul; Struyf, Sofie","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4c1a95a7e0982325ea7d3eb258483a4c7b32bd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26744452/; https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.3mr0915-401r","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occurrence of CD26","CD26 cleavages","application of CD26 inhibitors","CD26 knockout mice","chemokine processing","chemokine concentration","chemokine function","modulation of chemokine activity","terminal cleavage of chemokines","processed chemokine isoforms","CCL3L1","CXCL12","terminal dipeptides","chemotactic activity","outcome of NH","CCL5","terminal truncation","cleavage site","large number of human chemokines","receptor recognition","Post\u2010translational modification of chemokines","viral infection","use of mice","receptor binding","progenitor cell release","tumor cell migration","dependent inhibition of HIV infection","pathologic processes","leukocyte","significant impact","CXCL2","CXCL6","CXCL10","CXCL11","drastic alterations","specificity","CCL4","penultimate Pro","prominent effects","CXCL9","bone marrow","CCL11","plasma","essential regulatory mechanism","add\u2010on therapy","cancer","CCL14","tissues","proteins","importance","amino acids","similar result","difference","interactions","molecules","dipeptidylpeptidase IV","CCL22","blood","efficiency","inflammatory response","biologic activities"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient\u0027s chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity. RESULTS The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow. CONCLUSION The chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral ground-glass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u20132.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.","publish_time":"2017-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Hyuk-Jun","journal":"Biomed Eng Online","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07bf7b392feb438d436be66e2bdfe7513320231b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5470331.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-017-0370-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","Korea Hospital Association"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea","West Africa","Guinea","Liberia"],"keyphrases":["South Korea MERS outbreak","South Korea outbreak","basic reproductive number","evaluation of basic reproduction number","largest MERS outbreak","MERS-CoV","epidemic data","Ebola outbreak","MERS coronavirus","spread of MERS","epidemic characteristics of MERS","SIR model","model parameters","average number of secondary cases","mathematical model","Korea Hospital Association","outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome","susceptible-infected","early phase","infected subject produces","Guinea","infectious period","West Africa","Sierra Leone","set of ordinary differential equations","sum","terms","squared errors","Liberia","ODEs","stochastic fluctuations","best conditions","infections","uninfected population","study","paper","METHODS","people","suspicious symptoms","intervention","problems","report","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","values","patients","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Its function has been recently described: it codes for immune-responsive gene 1 protein/cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase (IRG1/CAD), an enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid from cis-aconitic acid, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. Itaconic acid possesses specific antimicrobial properties inhibiting isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, an anaplerotic pathway that bypasses the TCA cycle and enables bacteria to survive on limited carbon conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying itaconic acid production through IRG1 induction in macrophages, we examined the transcriptional regulation of IRG1. To this end, we studied IRG1 expression in human immune cells under different inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF\u03B1 and IFN\u03B3, in addition to lipopolysaccharides. Under these conditions, as previously shown in mouse macrophages, IRG1/CAD accumulates in mitochondria. Furthermore, using literature information and transcription factor prediction models, we re-constructed raw gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for IRG1 in mouse and human macrophages. We further implemented a contextualization algorithm that relies on genome-wide gene expression data to infer putative cell type-specific gene regulatory interactions in mouse and human macrophages, which allowed us to predict potential transcriptional regulators of IRG1. Among the computationally identified regulators, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in macrophages significantly decreased the expression of IRG1/CAD at the gene and protein level, which correlated with a reduced production of itaconic acid. Using a synergistic approach of both computational and experimental methods, we here shed more light on the transcriptional machinery of IRG1 expression and could pave the way to therapeutic approaches targeting itaconic acid levels.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tallam, Aravind; Perumal, Thaneer M.; Antony, Paul M.; J\u00E4ger, Christian; Fritz, Jo\u00EBlle V.; Vallar, Laurent; Balling, Rudi; del Sol, Antonio; Michelucci, Alessandro","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c2c2d6a805a6ea5cdd4568c9bedeedc705e1043.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752512.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26872335/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of IRG1","IRG1 induction","itaconic acid production","itaconic acid levels","transcriptional regulation of IRG1","tricarboxylic acid","human macrophages","mouse macrophages","transcriptional machinery of IRG1 expression","reduced production of itaconic acid","Immunoresponsive gene","potential transcriptional regulators of IRG1","immune-responsive gene","cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase","CAD","genome-wide gene expression data","re-constructed raw gene regulatory networks","putative cell type-specific gene regulatory interactions","siRNA-mediated gene silencing of interferon regulatory factor","human immune cells","enzyme","TCA cycle","pro-inflammatory conditions","limited carbon conditions","protein level","cycle intermediate","different inflammatory stimuli","specific antimicrobial properties","transcription factor prediction models","GRNs","isocitrate lyase","highest induced genes","TNF\u03B1","literature information","anaplerotic pathway","bacteria","therapeutic approaches","experimental methods","IFN\u03B3","glyoxylate shunt","light","IRF1","mechanisms","synergistic approach","addition","codes","contextualization algorithm","lipopolysaccharides","mitochondria","end","function"],"language":"en"},

TLR-3 is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells, respiratory epithelium, and macrophages, and appears to play a central role in mediating both the antiviral and inflammatory responses of the innate immunity in combating viral infections. Influenza viruses can effectively inhibit the host\u0027s ability to produce interferons, and thereby suppress the immune system\u0027s antiviral defence mechanisms. Poly ICLC is a synthetic double stranded RNA comprising of polyriboinosinic-poly ribocytidylic acid (Poly IC) stabilized with l-lysine (L) and carboxymethylcellulose (C). Poly ICLC and liposome-encapsulated Poly ICLC (LE Poly ICLC) are TLR-3 agonists and are potent inducer of interferons and natural killer cells. Intranasal pre-treatment of mice with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC provided high level of protection against lethal challenge with a highly lethal avian H5N1 influenza (HPAI) strain (A/H5N1/chicken/Henan clade 2), and against lethal seasonal influenza A/PR/8/34 [H1N1] and A/Aichi/2 [H3N2] virus strains. The duration of protective antiviral immunity to multiple lethal doses of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 virus had been previously found to persist for up to 3 weeks in mice for LE Poly ICLC and 2 weeks for Poly ICLC. Similarly, pre-treatment of mice with CpG oligonucleotides (TLR-9 agonist) was also found to provide complete protection against influenza A/PR/8/34 infection in mice. RT-PCR analysis of lung tissues of mice treated with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC revealed upregulation of TLR-3 mRNAs gene expression. Taken together, these results do support the potential role of TLR-3 and TLR-9 agonists such as Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC in protection against lethal seasonal and HPAI virus infection.","publish_time":"2009-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, J.

We expressed human SCARB2 gene in NIH3T3 cells (3T3-SCARB2) to study the mechanisms of EV71 entry and infection. We demonstrated that human SCARB2 serves as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry. Disruption of expression of SCARB2 using siRNAs can interfere EV71 infection and subsequent inhibit the expression of viral capsid proteins in RD and 3T3-SCARB2 but not Vero cells. SiRNAs specific to clathrin or dynamin or chemical inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis were all capable of interfering with the entry of EV71 into 3T3-SCARB2 cells. On the other hand, caveolin specific siRNA or inhibitors of caveolae-mediated endocytosis had no effect, confirming that only clathrin-mediated pathway was involved in EV71 infection. Endocytosis of EV71 was also found to be pH-dependent requiring endosomal acidification and also required intact membrane cholesterol. In summary, the mechanism of EV71 entry through SCARB2 as the receptor for attachment, and its cellular entry is through a clathrin-mediated and pH-dependent endocytic pathway. This study on the receptor and endocytic mechanisms of EV71 infection is useful for the development of effective medications and prophylactic treatment against the enterovirus.","publish_time":"2012-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yi-Wen; Lin, Hsiang-Yin; Tsou, Yueh-Liang; Chitra, Ebenezer; Hsiao, Kuang-Nan; Shao, Hsiao-Yun; Liu, Chia-Chyi; Sia, Charles; Chong, Pele; Chow, Yen-Hung","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98e52cb0b81f381ecd6138f73e6596de35d7566f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3260287.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22272359/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South East Asia"],"keyphrases":["entry of EV71","Endocytosis of EV71","cellular receptor of EV71","control of EV71 infection","mechanisms of EV71 entry","outbreak of EV71","mechanism of EV71 entry","endocytic mechanisms of EV71 infection","3T3-SCARB2 cells","human SCARB2 gene","cellular entry","mediated endocytosis","clathrin-mediated pathway","human scavenger receptor class B","chemical inhibitor of clathrin","SiRNAs specific","NIH3T3 cells","pH-dependent endocytic pathway","Vero cells","neurological disorders","Enterovirus","study","Disruption of expression","hand-foot","pH-dependent requiring endosomal acidification","caveolin specific siRNA","expression of viral capsid proteins","inhibitors of caveolae","public health interventions","development of effective medications","dynamin","member","treatments","prophylactic treatment","capable of interfering","severe cases","South East Asia","HFMD","intact membrane cholesterol","mouth disease","attachment","people","summary","fatality","individuals"],"language":"en"},

Mosquito cell lines released E at a similar rate (t 1 2 \u003E 8 hr), while NS1 and NS1\u2032 were retained in an undegraded form in the cell layer. The proteolytic processing of the three proteins appeared identical in both cell types, but some differences in Winked glycosylation were observed. E, NS1, and NS1\u2032 found within the infected cells of both types contained high-mannose oligosaccharide groups for more than 8 hr after synthesis. Additional sugar residues were added to the single E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from Vero cells, while sugar residues were trimmed from the E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from mosquito cells. The forms of NS1 and NS1\u2032 found in the culture fluid of infected Vero cells contained one complex and one high-mannose oligosaccharide. All three glycoproteins released from JE-infected Vero cells were associated with extracellular particles, the virion in the case of E and a low density particle in the case of NS1\u2032 and NSV. Furthermore, E, NS1\u2032 and NS1\u2032 exhibited amphipathic properties in Triton X-114 extraction experiments.

While the role of specific tetherin domains in antiviral activity is clearly established, the role of glycosylation in tetherin function is not clear. In this study, we carried out a detailed investigation of this question by using tetherin variants in which one or both sites of N-linked glycosylation were mutated (N65A, N92A, and N65,92A), and chemical inhibitors that prevent glycosylation at specific stages of oligosaccharide were added or modified. The single N-linked glycosylation mutants, N65A and N92A, efficiently inhibited the release of Vpu-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In contrast, the non-glycosylated double mutant, N65,92A, lost its ability to block HIV-1 release. The inability of the N65,92A mutant to inhibit HIV-1 release is associated with a lack of cell-surface expression. A role for glycosylation in cell-surface tetherin expression is supported by tunicamycin treatment, which inhibits the first step of N-linked glycosylation and impairs both cell-surface expression and antiviral activity. Inhibition of complex-type glycosylation with kifunensine, an inhibitor of the oligosaccharide processing enzyme mannosidase 1, had no effect on either the cell-surface expression or antiviral activity of tetherin. These results demonstrate that high-mannose modification of a single asparagine residue is necessary and sufficient, while complex-type glycosylation is dispensable, for cell-surface tetherin expression and antiviral activity.","publish_time":"2018-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waheed, Abdul A.; Gitzen, Ariana; Swiderski, Maya; Freed, Eric O.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11416bee008daf3c42621002ba7f3a6939601b0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5795439.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10010026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303997/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-surface tetherin expression","role of glycosylation","cell-surface expression","antiviral activity of tetherin","complex-type glycosylation","tetherin function","tetherin variants","single N-linked glycosylation mutants","role of specific tetherin domains","lack of cell","HIV","surface of infected cells","release of Vpu","interferon-inducible antiviral protein","N65A","N92A","sites of N","step of N","specific stages of oligosaccharide","Inhibition of complex","defective human immunodeficiency virus type","single asparagine residue","non-glycosylated double mutant","oligosaccharide processing enzyme mannosidase","virions","high-mannose modification","kifunensine","broad spectrum of enveloped viruses","contrast","question","chemical inhibitors","effect","tunicamycin treatment","results","detailed investigation","inability","study"],"language":"en"},

The disease is characterized by diarrhea and dehydration causing mortality and growth retardation. In the last few decades, only classical PEDV was reported sporadically in Europe, but in 2014 outbreaks of PEDV were described in Germany. Phylogenetic analysis showed a very high nucleotide similarity with a variant of PEDV that was isolated in the US in January 2014. The epidemiological situation of PEDV infections in the Netherlands in 2014 was unknown and a seroprevalence study in swine was performed. In total, 838 blood samples from sows from 267 farms and 101 samples from wild boars were collected from May till November 2014 and tested for antibodies against PEDV by ELISA. The apparent herd prevalence of 0.75% suggests that PEDV was not circulating on a large scale in the Netherlands at this time. However, in November 2014 a clinical outbreak of PEDV was diagnosed in a fattener farm by PCR testing. This was the first confirmed PEDV outbreak since the early nineties. Sequence analyses showed that the viruses isolated in 2014 and 2015 in the Netherlands cluster with recently found European G1b strains. This suggests a one event introduction of PEDV G1b strains in Europe in 2014, which made the Netherlands and other European countries endemic for this type of strains since then.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dortmans, J.C.F.M.; Li, W.; van der Wolf, P.

The method is based on the cleavage of fluorescent dye-labelled probes by the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase during PCR and measurement of fluorescence intensity by a Sequence Detection System. The feline-specific TaqMan probes were designed to encompass an intron, thus allowing differentiation of complementary DNA versus genomic DNA amplification products. Quantitative analysis of cytokine cDNA concentrations was performed in comparison to feline GAPDH. Messenger RNA (mRNA) from the universally expressed housekeeping gene GAPDH proved to be useful as an amplification control and allowed for correction of variations in the efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. GAPDH mRNAs were readily detectable in cDNAs prepared from unstimulated feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and from frozen cell pellets, while cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, IFN\u03B3, IL-16) were expressed at variable amounts. IFN\u03B3 transcription was found to be upregulated in stimulated PBMCs and feline cell lines. The synthesis of cDNA and the performance of the PCR in separate tubes proved to be of superior sensitivity compared to a single-tube based system. The assays described are highly reproducible, require no post-PCR manipulation of the amplicons and permit the analysis of several hundred PCR reactions per day. With this method it is possible to detect and quantify cytokine mRNA expression reliably in small amounts of cells even after storage of samples for at least 5 years.","publish_time":"1999-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leutenegger, Christian M; Mislin, Caroline N; Sigrist, Brigitte; Ehrengruber, Markus U; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49f8851d0fac1bfa5fbb867ced073b2d2212d1d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119904.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242799001002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242799001002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sequence Detection System","GAPDH","IL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IL","feline GAPDH","feline cytokine gene expression","PCR reactions","feline cell lines","cytokine mRNA expression","real-time PCR systems","post-PCR manipulation","feline-specific TaqMan probes","housekeeping gene GAPDH","GAPDH mRNAs","IFN\u03B3 transcription","method","unstimulated feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells","Quantitative analysis of cytokine cDNA concentrations","genomic DNA amplification products","Taq DNA polymerase","differentiation of complementary DNA","small amounts of cells","stimulated PBMCs","amplification control","synthesis of cDNA","Messenger RNA","reverse transcription","variable amounts","frozen cell pellets","efficiencies of RNA extraction","Sequence Detection System","cleavage of fluorescent dye-labelled probes","cDNAs","measurement of fluorescence intensity","performance","cytokines","comparison","correction of variations","separate tubes","superior sensitivity","storage of samples","exonuclease activity","amplicons","Interleukin","p40","single-tube","intron","p35","years","day","assays"],"language":"en"},

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes lethal diarrhea in piglets, resulting in great economic losses all over the world. To detect and isolate PEDV rapidly and accurately is important for the control and further research of the clinical PEDV strains. In this study, four sdAb fragments (sdAb-Mc19/29/30/37) targeting the membrane (M) protein of PEDV were selected from sdAb library that was constructed through M protein-immunized Camelus bactrianus. The selected sdAb-Mcs were solubly expressed in Escherichia coli. The functional characteristics analysis revealed that the recombinant sdAb-Mcs have excellent binding activity and specificity to M protein but have no neutralizing activity to PEDV. For further application, sdAb-Mc37 was conjugated with quantum dots to synthesize a nanoprobe for imaging PEDV in vero cells. The observed fluorescence in vero cells clearly reflects that PEDV virions can be reliably recognized and labeled by the nanoprobe. Furthermore, the sdAb-Mc29 was conjugated with superparamagnetic nanobeads to construct immunomagnetic nanobeads (IMNBs) used to isolate PEDV. One PEDV strain was successfully isolated from clinical fecal sample, suggesting IMNBs as a novel and efficient tool suitable for PEDV isolation from clinical samples.

Sialic acids present on the epithelial surface have long been considered to be determinants of influenza virus tropism. However, mucus which is also rich in sialic acids may serve as the first barrier of selection. It was investigated how influenza virus interacts with the mucus to infect epithelial cells. Two techniques were applied to track SIV H1N1 in porcine mucus. The microscopic diffusion of SIV particles in the mucus was analyzed by single particle tracking (SPT), and the macroscopic penetration of SIV through mucus was studied by a virus in-capsule-mucus penetration system, followed by visualizing the translocation of the virions with time by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the effects of neuraminidase on SIV getting through or binding to the mucus were studied by using zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI), and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase. The distribution of the diffusion coefficient shows that 70% of SIV particles were entrapped, while the rest diffused freely in the mucus. Additionally, SIV penetrated the porcine mucus with time, reaching a depth of 65 \u00B5m at 30 min post virus addition, 2 fold of that at 2 min. Both the microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration were largely diminished by NAI, while were clearly increased by the effect of exogenous neuraminidase. Moreover, the exogenous neuraminidase sufficiently prevented the binding of SIV to mucus which was reversely enhanced by effect of NAI. These findings clearly show that the neuraminidase helps SIV move through the mucus, which is important for the virus to reach and infect epithelial cells and eventually become shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2014-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xiaoyun; Steukers, Lennert; Forier, Katrien; Xiong, Ranhua; Braeckmans, Kevin; Van Reeth, Kristien; Nauwynck, Hans","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6eb145a990b1132457f78c4e1521ab827b715ad0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4198190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333824/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","NAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine mucus","mucus layer","binding of SIV","macroscopic penetration of SIV","capsule-mucus penetration system","microscopic diffusion of SIV particles","track SIV H1N1","neuraminidase inhibitor","effects of neuraminidase","Swine influenza virus","effect of exogenous neuraminidase","determinants of influenza virus tropism","post virus addition","epithelial cells","effect of NAI","time","epithelial surface","diffusion coefficient","Sialic acids present","strong tropism","respiratory tract","pig respiratory mucosa","epithelium","basement membrane","SPT","lamina propria","virions","\u00B5m","single particle tracking","zanamivir","lumen","immunofluorescence staining","translocation","fold","techniques","Arthrobacter","depth","distribution","rest","barrier of selection","findings"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of the study were to describe the epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves from birth to 16 weeks of age (with an emphasis on respiratory disease), to examine individual calf and herd management practices as risk factors for calf morbidity and mortality, and to validate producer diagnosis of mortality. Incidence rates for all morbidity, enteritis, and pneumonia were 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 cases per 100 calf-days at risk for the period of the study. Risk of enteritis was highest in the first 3 weeks of life, with pneumonia risk highest at 10 weeks of age. Case fatality rates averaged 11.8%, 17.9%, and 9.4% for all diagnoses, enteritis, and pneumonia, respectively. Average daily rates of gain from birth to 16 weeks of age differed between farms that had inadequate calf housing (0.8 kg day\u22121) versus those with adequate calf housing (1.0 kg day\u22121). Approximately half of the calves in the cohort (418) had blood samples taken monthly from birth until 16 weeks of age. Of the calves sampled, only 19 calves showed a four-fold rise in serum titers to respiratory viruses. Sixteen calves seroconverted to BVDV, two calves to IBRV, and one calf to PI3 virus. Of 98 calves less than 10 days of age tested for adequacy of passive transfer, 35 (35.7%) had serum immunoglobulin levels of less than 800 mg dl\u22121. There were no significant differences in mortality or morbidity between calves that had adequate passive transfer and those that did not. The incidence of mortality was 0.08 deaths per 100 calf-days at risk; 64 calves died during the 16 months of the study. The risk of death was highest at 2 weeks of age. Enteritis was the most common cause of death (28 deaths, 44% of all deaths) followed by pneumonia (19 deaths, 30% of all deaths). Comparing producer diagnosis of mortality with necropsy results yielded sensitivities of 58.3% and 56% and specificities of 93% and 100% for producer diagnoses of enteritis and pneumonia, respectively. The kappa statistic comparing producer diagnosis with necropsy result was 0.47. The most common pathogens isolated from calves that died of enteritis were rotavirus (five calves), and Escherichia coli (four calves). Pathogens isolated from pneumonic lungs included Pasteurella multocida (three calves), Haemophilus somnus (three calves), and Pasteurella haemolytica (one calf).","publish_time":"1996-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sivula, N.

Until now, these decisions have been informed largely by early power analyses that were based on simulated, hypothetical CC genomes. Now that more than 50 CC strains are available and more than 70 CC genomes have been observed, it is possible to characterize power based on realized CC genomes. We report power analyses from extensive simulations and examine several key considerations: 1) the number of strains and biological replicates, 2) the QTL effect size, 3) the presence of population structure, and 4) the distribution of functionally distinct alleles among the founder strains at the QTL. We also provide general power estimates to aide in the design of future experiments.

The known receptors for MHV are all members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family. Although human forms of the MHV receptor can function as MHV receptors in some assays, no human cell line has been identified that can support wild-type MHV infection. Here we describe the infection of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HuH-7, with MHV. HuH-7 cells were susceptible to strains JHM-DL and JHM-DS, yielding virus titers nearly identical to those seen in mouse DBT cells. In contrast, HuH-7 cells were only marginally susceptible or completely resistant to infection by other MHV strains, including A59. JHM produced a strong cytopathic effect in HuH-7 cells with the formation of round plaques. Studies of various recombinant viruses between JHM and A59 strains suggested that the ability of JHM to infect HuH-7 cells was determined by multiple viral genetic elements. Blocking the viral spike (S) protein with a neutralizing antibody or a soluble form of the MHV receptor inhibited infection of HuH-7 cells, suggesting that infection is mediated through the S protein. Transfection with the prototype mouse receptor, biliary glycoprotein, rendered HuH-7 cells susceptible to infection by other MHV strains as well, suggesting that JHM uses a receptor distinct from the classical MHV receptor to infect HuH-7 cells. Possible implications for human disease are discussed.","publish_time":"1999-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koetters, Peter J.; Hassanieh, Loubna; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Gallagher, Thomas; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1e82ab3646382fd09d4e38c7041f89466f5028d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682299999841; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682299999841","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","JHM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV strains","MHV receptors","cells susceptible","MHV receptor inhibited infection","classical MHV receptor","wild-type MHV infection","JHM-DS","strain JHM","ability of JHM","mouse DBT cells","receptor distinct","prototype mouse receptor","A59 strains","human cell line","human disease","human forms","susceptible rodents","human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line","S protein","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","known receptors","viral spike","yielding virus titers","multiple viral genetic elements","soluble form","members","Studies of various recombinant viruses","neutralizing antibody","encephalitis","coronavirus","assays","biliary glycoprotein","demyelination","strong cytopathic effect","carcinoembryonic antigen family","Possible implications","formation of round plaques","Transfection","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The ability of the plant umbravirus, groundnut rosette virus, to move long distances through the phloem, the specialized plant vascular system, has been shown to strictly depend on the interaction of one of its proteins, the ORF3 protein (protein encoded by open reading frame 3), with fibrillarin. This interaction is essential for several stages in the groundnut rosette virus life cycle such as nucleolar import of the ORF3 protein via Cajal bodies, relocalization of some fibrillarin from the nucleolus to cytoplasm, and assembly of cytoplasmic umbraviral ribonucleoprotein particles that are themselves required for the long-distance spread of the virus and systemic infection. Here, using atomic force microscopy, we determine the architecture of these complexes as single-layered ringlike structures with a diameter of 18\u201322 nm and a height of 2.0\u00B10.4 nm, which consist of several (n =6\u20138) distinct protein granules.

In this work we evaluate whether F. hepatica glycans can immune modulate DCs via DC-SIGN. We demonstrate that DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycoconjugates through mannose and fucose residues. We also show that mannose is present in high-mannose structures, hybrid and trimannosyl N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc. Furthermore, we demonstrate that F. hepatica glycans induce DC-SIGN triggering leading to a strong production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28. In addition, parasite glycans induced regulatory DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation, via the induction of anergic/regulatory T cells, highlighting the role of DC-SIGN in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses by F. hepatica.

The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally. Purpose This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons. These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained. Results Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19. There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia. A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chhabra, Harvinder Singh; Bagaraia, Vaibhav; Keny, Swapnil; Kalidindi, Kalyan Kumar Varma; Mallepally, Abhinandan; Dhillon, Mandeep Singh; Malhotra, Rajesh; Rajasekharan, Shanmuganathan","journal":"Indian journal of orthopaedics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s43465-020-00135-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Pandemic","patients","orthopaedic surgeons","Inpatient management of COVID","hospital visits","health care workers","front-line workers","regional anaesthesia","emergent care","line of treatment","current knowledge","Conservative treatment","clinical features","safety measures","brief understanding of pathophysiology","Wuhan","control","specific workflow","preference","diagnosis","significant lessons","best practices","mysterious cluster outbreak of pneumonia","great importance","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","separate Operation room","risk","magnitude of challenge","approval","special considerations","Implementation of infection prevention","China","review","opportunity","concerned authorities","visitors","staff","containment zones","lockdown","elective surgeries","adversity","Conclusions","evidence","telemedicine","widespread devastation","positive cases","time","attempts","Ikigai"],"language":"en"},

But these therapies are very often of limited efficacy or have severe side effects. Therefore there is great interest in developing new efficacious and safe antiviral compounds e.g. based on the identification of compounds of herbal origin. Hypothesis Since an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill. shows antiviral activity against viruses causing infections of the upper respiratory tract in vitro we hypothesised that a product containing it such as Biaron C\u00AE could have an antiviral activity too. Study design Antiviral activity of Bioaron C\u00AE, an herbal medicinal product consisting of an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill., Vitamin C, and Aronia melanocarpa Elliot. succus, added as an excipient, was tested in vitro against a broad panel of viruses involved in upper respiratory tract infections. Methods These studies included human adenovirus and several RNA viruses and were performed either with plaque reduction assays or with tests for the detection of a virus-caused cytopathic effect. Results Our studies demonstrated an impressive activity of Bioaron C\u00AE against members of the orthomyxoviridae \u2013 influenza A and influenza B viruses. Replication of both analysed influenza A virus strains \u2013 H1N1 and H3N2 \u2013 as well as replication of two analysed influenza B viruses \u2013 strains Yamagatal and Beiying \u2013 was significantly reduced after addition of Bioaron C\u00AE to the infected cell cultures. In contrast antiviral activity of Bioaron C\u00AE against other RNA viruses showed a heterogeneous pattern. Bioaron C\u00AE inhibited the replication of human rhinovirus and coxsackievirus, both viruses belonging to the family of picornaviridae and both representing non-enveloped RNA viruses. In vitro infections with respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus, both belonging to the paramyxoviridae, were only poorly blocked by the test substance. No antiviral activity of Bioaron C\u00AE was detected against adenovirus \u2013 a non-enveloped DNA virus. Conclusions These results represent the first proof of a selective antiviral activity of Bioaron C\u00AE against influenza viruses and create basis for further analyses of type and molecular mechanisms of the antiviral activity of this herbal medicine.","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glatthaar-Saalm\u00FCller, B.; Fal, A.

Nine high frequency spots were found in the 6 positive patients and 8 high frequency spots clustered in the \u2162 and \u2163 domains. CONCLUSION: These findings will offer new clues for the futher studies of EGFR and EGFR autoantibodies.","publish_time":"2010-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6f478369adbfd8be967251a9bb0dd17fa436c45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6000384.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20673491/; https://doi.org/10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2010.07.13","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EGFR autoantibodies","EGFR autoantibodis","futher studies of EGFR","peptide array","extracellular domain of EGFR protein","positive patients","high frequency spots","prognosis of lung cancer","serums of non-small cell lung cancer patients","new clues","positive rate","new tumor markers","epidermal growth factor receptor","important role","OBJECTIVE","early diagnosis","synthesizer","epitopes","ASPSL","study","findings","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Intavis company","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","domains"],"language":"en"},

Objective we investigated the presence of virus and the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in healthy mucosal tissue of control subjects and the inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of CRS patients, and evaluated whether levels of interferons and ISGs might be affected by CRS-related cytokines and by treatment with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists. Methods The presence of virus in the sinonasal mucosa was evaluated with real-time PCR. The expression of interferons and ISGs in the sinonasal mucosa and in cultured epithelial cells treated with TH1 and TH2 cytokines, macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists were evaluated with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in the sinonasal mucosa were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 15% of samples. Interferons and ISGs are expressed in normal mucosa, but their levels were decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels were upregulated in cells treated with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 agonist, but some were decreased in cytokine-treated cells. TLR3 and TLR7 levels showed no significant difference between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. Conclusion These results suggest that decreased levels of interferons and ISGs in patients with CRS might contribute to impairment of the antiviral innate response in inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells. Macrolides and glucocorticoids might provide positive effects on the treatment of CRS by upregulating interferon and ISG expression.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Jae Woong; Lee, Ki Jeong; Choi, In Hak; Han, Hye Min; Kim, Tae Hoon; Lee, Sang Hag","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4db11ef895a9b39990f3b969f7ee8e9c4588ead.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111475.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2019.08.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674919310966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449915/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674919310966","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRS","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISGs","TLR7 levels","expression of TLR3","sinonasal mucosal tissue of patients","treatment of CRS","macrolides","decreased levels of interferons","expression of interferons","inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of CRS patients","inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells","TLR7 agonists","ISG levels","dexamethasone","normal mucosa","CRS-related cytokines","TLR3 agonist","ISG expression","cytokine-treated cells","upregulating interferon","expression of Toll","cultured epithelial cells","healthy mucosal tissue of control subjects","interferon-stimulated genes","real-time PCR","presence of virus","antiviral responses","TH2 cytokines","antiviral innate response","significant difference","TH1","chronic rhinosinusitis","positive effects","impairment","receptor","Western blotting","glucocorticoids","Background","Objective","Methods","Conclusion","immunohistochemistry","Respiratory viruses","samples"],"language":"en"},

We extend the literature by using a novel approach with the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags (NARDL) model (Shin et al., 2014). The main advantage of this model relies on its ability to simultaneously capture the short- and long-run asymmetries through positive and negative partial sum decompositions of changes in the independent variable(s). Moreover, we rely on local gold prices instead of those from London converted into local currencies like in most of previous studies. The results show that gold is not a hedge against inflation in the long run in all cases. In the short run, gold is an inflation hedge only in the UK, USA, and India. Furthermore, there is no long-run equilibrium between gold prices and the CPI in China, India and France. This difference may be due to traditional aspects of gold and custom controls for gold trade in these countries. Our robustness check suggests that the data time-frequency does not change the specification of the NARDL model but can change conclusions regarding the role of gold as a hedge against inflation in certain countries.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoang, Thi Hong Van; Lahiani, Amine; Heller, David","journal":"Economic Modelling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d76bdec4968a86dd477ce10ca86ef4fefa30f41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115710.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264999315004095; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999315004095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287826/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2015.12.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States of America","London","India","France"],"keyphrases":["role of gold","gold trade","local gold prices","inflation","local monthly gold prices","hedge","traditional aspects of gold","long run","India","short run","NARDL model","China","France","local currencies","United Kingdom","certain countries","United States of America","nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags","negative partial sum decompositions of changes","custom controls","Japan","CPI","novel approach","asymmetries","independent variable","London","conclusions","data time-frequency","robustness check","periods","specification","Shin","UK","equilibrium","previous studies","literature","difference","main advantage","USA","ability","cases","paper","results"],"language":"en"},

This technique delivers date-stamping strategies for the emergence as well as collapse of explosive bubble episodes and is best suited for practical application to time series. The results reveal that four explosive bubbles are detected over the period of 1980\u20132019 when copper price deviates from fundamental value. Besides, this finding is in accordance with the asset pricing model (G\u00FCrkaynak, 2008), which generally considers both fundamental and bubble components in the presence of asset prices. Based on the empirical results, the multiple emergence and collapse of multiple price bubbles are attributed to speculation, depreciation of the U.S. dollar, an imbalance between supply and demand, and financial crises.

It is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to abnormalities in the lower airway following consistent exposure to noxious particles or gases. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are characterized by increased cough, purulent sputum production, and dyspnea. The AECOPD is mostly associated with infection caused by common cold viruses or bacteria, or co-infections. Chronic and persistent infection by non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a Gram-negative coccobacillus, contributes to almost half of the infective exacerbations caused by bacteria. This is supported by reports that NTHi is commonly isolated in the sputum from COPD patients during exacerbations. Persistent colonization of NTHi in the lower airway requires a plethora of phenotypic adaptation and virulent mechanisms that are developed over time to cope with changing environmental pressures in the airway such as host immuno-inflammatory response. Chronic inhalation of noxious irritants in COPD causes a changed balance in the lung microbiome, abnormal inflammatory response, and an impaired airway immune system. These conditions significantly provide an opportunistic platform for NTHi colonization and infection resulting in a \u201Cvicious circle.\u201D Episodes of large inflammation as the consequences of multiple interactions between airway immune cells and NTHi, accumulatively contribute to COPD exacerbations and may result in worsening of the clinical status. In this review, we discuss in detail the interplay and crosstalk between airway immune residents and NTHi, and their effect in AECOPD for better understanding of NTHi pathogenesis in COPD patients.","publish_time":"2018-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Yu-Ching; Jalalvand, Farshid; Thegerstr\u00F6m, John; Riesbeck, Kristian","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d2a06d34c1ae369008931acca5000233e246011.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6230626.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455693/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02530","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD exacerbations","NTHi colonization","lower airway","Persistent colonization of NTHi","COPD patients","Acute exacerbations of COPD","airway immune residents","airway immune cells","persistent infection","AECOPD","impaired airway immune system","better understanding of NTHi pathogenesis","infective exacerbations","persistent respiratory symptoms","bacteria","Chronic inhalation of noxious irritants","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","abnormal inflammatory response","debilitating respiratory disease","immuno-inflammatory response","noxious particles","purulent sputum production","leading causes of morbidity","consequences of multiple interactions","non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae","consistent exposure","lung microbiome","changed balance","abnormalities","plethora of phenotypic adaptation","airflow limitation","time","virulent mechanisms","common cold viruses","increased cough","effect","opportunistic platform","crosstalk","Episodes of large inflammation","gases","half","changing environmental pressures","interplay","worsening","co-infections","Gram-negative coccobacillus","mortality","dyspnea","clinical status","conditions","vicious circle","reports","review"],"language":"en"},

Frequencies of infections are only known for hospitalized children. Objectives Comparing infection frequencies in children who have mild infections with frequencies in children needing hospital uptake will determine whether infection by one of the four HCoVs leads to more severe disease. In addition, the sequence of seroconversions can reveal whether infection by one HCoV protects from infection by other HCoVs. Study design Two distinct study groups were monitored: healthy children and children hospitalized due to respiratory infection. HCoV natural infection rates in healthy children were obtained by serology in 25 newborns (followed 0\u201320months). The frequencies of severe HCoVs infection was determined by real time RT-PCR among 1471 hospitalized infants (\u003C2-years old) with acute respiratory tract disease. Results The majority of healthy children seroconverted for HCoV-OC43 (n =19) and HCoV-NL63 (n =17), less for HCoV-HKU1 (n =9) and HCoV-229E (n =5). Notably, HCoV-HKU1 seroconversion was absent after HCoV-OC43 infection. Also HCoV-229E infection was rarely observed after HCoV-NL63 infection (1 out of 5). In the hospital 207 (14%) out of 1471 children were HCoV positive. Again we observed most infection by HCoV-OC43 (n =85) and HCoV-NL63 (n =60), followed by HCoV-HKU1 (n =47) and HCoV-229E (n =15). Conclusions HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 infections occur frequently in early childhood, more often than HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-229E infections. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E infection, respectively, which would explain why HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are the most frequently infecting HCoVs. There are no indications that infection by one of the HCoVs is more pathogenic than others.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dijkman, Ronald; Jebbink, Maarten F.; Gaunt, Eleanor; Rossen, John W.A.; Templeton, Kate E.; Kuijpers, Taco W.; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b03568dc72115a022f2a50749da7c2df37aef2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108278.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653211004732; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653211004732; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2011.11.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22188723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-NL63 infection","HCoV positive","HCoV-OC43 infections","Conclusions HCoV-NL63","subsequent HCoV-HKU1","HCoV-HKU1 seroconversion","HCoV natural infection rates","infection frequencies","respiratory infection","frequencies of severe HCoVs infection","hospitalized children","E infections","majority of healthy children","Frequencies of infections","infecting HCoVs","mild infections","hospitalized infants","severe disease","Study design","acute respiratory tract disease","hospital uptake","distinct study groups","years old","real time RT-PCR","human coronaviruses","extent","early childhood","immunity","sequence of seroconversions","serology","Objectives","Abstract Background","newborns","addition","months","indications"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, two complete BToV genome sequences (MN073058 and MN073059) were obtained from the clinical samples, which were 28,297 and 28,301 nucleotides in length, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that the two isolates shared 10 identical amino acid mutations in the S protein compared to the complete S sequences of BToV available in the GenBank database. In addition, seven consecutive amino acid mutations were found from aa 1,486 to 1,492 in the S protein of isolate MN073058. Moreover, the two isolates shared one identical amino acid mutation in the receptor binding sites of the HE protein.

Macrophages and neutrophils constitute the majority of cells recruited into infected lungs, and are associated with immunopathology in influenza pneumonia. We examined pathological manifestations in models of macrophage- or neutrophil-depleted mice challenged with sublethal doses of influenza A virus H1N1 strain PR8. Infected mice depleted of macrophages displayed excessive neutrophilic infiltration, alveolar damage, and increased viral load, later progressing into ARDS-like pathological signs with diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and hypoxemia. In contrast, neutrophil-depleted animals showed mild pathology in lungs. The brochoalveolar lavage fluid of infected macrophage-depleted mice exhibited elevated protein content, T1-\u03B1, thrombomodulin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and myeloperoxidase activities indicating augmented alveolar-capillary damage, compared to neutrophil-depleted animals. We provide evidence for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), entangled with alveoli in areas of tissue injury, suggesting their potential link with lung damage. When co-incubated with infected alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, neutrophils from infected lungs strongly induced NETs generation, and augmented endothelial damage. NETs induction was abrogated by anti-myeloperoxidase antibody and an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase, thus implying that NETs generation is induced by redox enzymes in influenza pneumonia. These findings support the pathogenic effects of excessive neutrophils in acute lung injury of influenza pneumonia by instigating alveolar-capillary damage.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narasaraju, Teluguakula; Yang, Edwin; Samy, Ramar Perumal; Ng, Huey Hian; Poh, Wee Peng; Liew, Audrey-Ann; Phoon, Meng Chee; van Rooijen, Nico; Chow, Vincent T.","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46ee2266b2315dd11276c4ba0e338468461bb928.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7a7fb9401e1f53139f1c850f1d6722f654640773.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3123873.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944011003294; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944011003294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21703402/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.03.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Infected mice","infected lungs","diffuse alveolar damage","lung damage","neutrophil-depleted mice","augmented alveolar-capillary damage","neutrophil-depleted animals","infected alveolar epithelial cells","augmented endothelial damage","acute lung injury of influenza pneumonia","brochoalveolar lavage fluid of infected macrophage-depleted mice","induced NETs generation","pathogenic influenza viruses","NETs induction","sublethal doses of influenza","pathogenic effects of excessive neutrophils","ARDS","Macrophages","formation of neutrophil extracellular traps","myeloperoxidase activities","models of macrophage","majority of cells","pathological signs","pathological manifestations","excessive neutrophilic infiltration","anti-myeloperoxidase antibody","areas of tissue injury","Complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome","elevated protein content","T1-\u03B1","pulmonary edema","virus H1N1 strain PR8","thrombomodulin","matrix metalloproteinase","inhibitor of superoxide dismutase","ill patients","potential link","hemorrhage","increased viral load","mild pathology","redox enzymes","alveoli","hypoxemia","evidence","findings","contrast","immunopathology"],"language":"en"},

At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of both infection and mortality. A panel of experts recently released recommendations for prioritising urologic surgeries in a low-resource setting. Of note, major cancer surgery represents a compelling challenge. However, the burden of these procedures and the impact of such recommendations on urologic practice are currently unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed the yearly proportion of high-priority major uro-oncologic surgeries at three Italian high-volume academic centres. Of 2387 major cancer surgeries, 32.3% were classified as high priority (12.6% of radical nephroureterectomy, 17.3% of nephrectomy, 33.9% of radical prostatectomy, and 36.2% of radical cystectomy cases). Moreover, 26.4% of high-priority major cancer surgeries were performed in patients at higher perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score \u22653), with radical cystectomy contributing the most to this cohort (50%). Our real-life data contextualise ongoing recommendations on prioritisation strategies during the current COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for better patient selection for surgery. We found that approximately two-thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries can be safely postponed or changed to another treatment modality when the availability of health care resources is reduced. Patient summary: We used data from three high-volume Italian academic urology centres to evaluate how many surgeries performed for prostate, bladder, kidney, and upper tract urothelial cancer can be postponed in times of emergency. We found that approximately two-thirds of patients with these cancers do not require high-priority surgery. Conversely, of patients requiring high-priority surgery, approximately one in four is considered at high perioperative risk. These patients may pose challenges in allocation of resources in critical scenarios such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campi, Riccardo; Amparore, Daniele; Capitanio, Umberto; Checcucci, Enrico; Salonia, Andrea; Fiori, Cristian; Minervini, Andrea; Briganti, Alberto; Carini, Marco; Montorsi, Francesco; Serni, Sergio; Porpiglia, Francesco","journal":"Eur Urol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9342b7bf05ed34ee0aaf29506eeaca8f507fdaa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151319.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307215/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.054; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283820302293?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0302283820302293","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high priority","high-priority major cancer surgeries","high-priority surgery","major cancer surgery","priority major uro-oncologic surgeries","urologic surgeries","high perioperative risk","thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries","thirds of patients","pandemic","yearly proportion of high","current COVID","radical prostatectomy","radical nephroureterectomy","radical cystectomy cases","ongoing recommendations","Italian high-volume academic centres","high-volume Italian academic urology centres","upper tract urothelial cancer","availability of health care resources","aspects of health care","higher perioperative risk","real-life data","urologic practice","allocation of resources","times of emergency","Patient summary","unprecedented emergency scenario","better patient selection","prioritisation strategies","kidney","American Society of Anesthesiologists score","critical scenarios","bladder","impact","need","highest rates","Italy","country","challenges","nephrectomy","compelling challenge","cancers","low-resource setting","treatment modality","infection","mortality","procedures","note","time of writing","panel of experts","burden","gap","cohort","coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient\u0027s weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted.

We report the dynamics of peripheral immune cells, cytokines, and human leucocyte antigen\u2010G (HLA\u2010G) and its receptor expressions in a patient suffering from critical COVID\u201019 pneumonia to convalescence. METHODS: Clinical data of the patient were collected from medical records. The expressions of HLA\u2010G and receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 in peripheral immune cells were measured with flow cytometry. RESULTS: From critical COVID\u201019 to the convalescent stage, early lymphopenia was improved (median: 0.6 \u00D7 10(9) L(\u22121) vs. 0.9 \u00D7 10(9) L(\u22121), P = 0.009), and an obvious fluctuation in WBC and neutrophil counts was observed. Initially, low levels of CD4(\u002B) T cells (from 120 to 528 \u03BCL(\u22121)) and CD8(\u002B) T cells (from 68 to 362 \u03BCL(\u22121)) gradually increased to normal levels.

The BME reveals that SARS outbreaks show autocorrelation within certain spatial and temporal distances. We use BME to fit a theoretical covariance model that has a sine hole spatial component and exponential temporal component and obtain the weights of geographical and temporal autocorrelation factors. Using the covariance model, SARS dynamics were estimated and simulated under the most probable conditions. Our study suggests that SARS transmission varies in its epidemiological characteristics and SARS outbreak distributions exhibit palpable clusters on both spatial and temporal scales. In addition, the BME modelling demonstrates that SARS transmission features are affected by spatial heterogeneity, so we analyze potential causes.

Case report We report a case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicating severe EBV pneumonia and requiring prolonged artificial ventilation. The diagnosis was confirmed by specific serology and estimation of the viral load by PCR. Apart from supportive treatment with artificial ventilation the medical treatment included the use of Acyclovir and polyclonal immunoglobulins in the early phase and corticosteroids in the late phase. Recovery was progressive and complete. Conclusion ARDS can complicate EBV pneumonia in an immuno-competent subject. Its management represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riachy, M.; Baaklini, C.; Ibrahim, I.; Azar, H.; Yaghi, C.; Dabar, G.; Bazarbachi, T.; Nasnas, R.; Karam-Sarkis, D.; Germanos, M.; Maacaron, N.; Khayat, G.; Choucair, J.","journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea5727a303e15d83277d3a70972006599442dbcf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842507911341; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842507911341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Barr"],"keyphrases":["EBV compliqu\u00E9e","corticosteroids in the late phase","Summary Introduction In the immuno","polyclonal immunoglobulins in the early phase","the viral load","The diagnosis was confirmed","Apart from supportive treatment with artificial ventilation the medical treatment included the","complicating severe EBV pneumonia","ventilation m\u00E9canique","phase pr\u00E9coce","phase tardive","Conclusion ARDS can complicate EBV pneumonia in an immuno","requiring prolonged artificial ventilation","Acyclovir","ventilation artificielle prolong\u00E9e","SDRA","diagnostic","PCR","Case report We report","Recovery was progressive","Barr virus","competent subject","Epstein Barr","recherche de la charge","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction","pneumonie grave","competent adult Ebstein","acute respiratory distress syndrome","syndrome de d\u00E9tresse respiratoire aigu","specific serology","self","estimation","infection is","limiting disease that resolves spontaneously","adulte immunocomp\u00E9tent","cortico\u00EFdes syst\u00E9miques","usage des s\u00E9rologies sp\u00E9cifiques","Its management represents","therapeutic challenge","immunoglobulines polyclonales","d\u00E9fi diagnostique","utilisation","Observation","strat\u00E9gie protectrice","traitement m\u00E9dical","ADN virale","recours","maladie autolimit\u00E9e","prise","complete","gu\u00E9rison"],"language":"fr"},

However, no reliable biomarkers are currently available for accurate early detection of ARDS in patients with predisposing conditions. OBJECTIVES: This study examined risk factors and biomarkers for ARDS development and mortality in two prospective cohort studies. METHODS: We examined clinical risk factors for ARDS in a cohort of 178 patients in Beijing, China who were admitted to the ICU and were at high risk for ARDS. Identified biomarkers were then replicated in a second cohort of1,878 patients in Boston, USA. RESULTS: Of 178 patients recruited from participating hospitals in Beijing, 75 developed ARDS. After multivariate adjustment, sepsis (odds ratio [OR]:5.58, 95% CI: 1.70\u201318.3), pulmonary injury (OR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.60\u20136.47), and thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count \u003C80\u00D710(3)/\u00B5L, (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.27\u20135.62)were significantly associated with increased risk of developing ARDS. Thrombocytopenia was also associated with increased mortality in patients who developed ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.07\u20131.57) but not in those who did not develop ARDS(AHR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.96\u20131.62). The presence of both thrombocytopenia and ARDS substantially increased 60-daymortality. Sensitivity analyses showed that a platelet count of \u003C100\u00D710(3)/\u00B5Lin combination with ARDS provide the highest prognostic value for mortality. These associations were replicated in the cohort of US patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study of ICU patients in both China and US showed that thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk of ARDS and platelet count in combination with ARDS had a high predictive value for patient mortality.","publish_time":"2014-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Tiehua; Liu, Zhuang; Wang, Zhaoxi; Duan, Meili; Li, Gang; Wang, Shupeng; Li, Wenxiong; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Wei, Yongyue; Christiani, David C.; Li, Ang; Zhu, Xi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c848bce30b9e60bccfd15a5534af1d0cea54c686.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3986053.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732309/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","ARDS","USA"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["developed ARDS","increased risk of ARDS","ARDS development","increased risk of developing ARDS","cohort of US patients","accurate early detection of ARDS","ill patients","study of ICU patients","increased mortality","thrombocytopenia","high risk","platelet count","clinical risk factors","patient mortality","cohort of1","Beijing","China","prospective cohort studies","AHR","reliable biomarkers","high predictive value","\u00B5Lin combination","odds ratio","highest prognostic value","adjusted hazard ratio","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","potential","intensive care unit","improvethe prognosis","participating hospitals","multivariate adjustment","sepsis","Boston","predisposing conditions","BACKGROUND","Sensitivity analyses","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","USA","presence","pulmonary injury","associations","RESULTS","daymortality"],"language":"en"},

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) was detected in suckling and weaning pigs by RT-PCR assays. Coronavirus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy. The virus isolate was designated PHEV-JT06. The clinical signs, nervous symptoms and positive labeling of neurons in the cerebral cortex with an immunohistochemical stain in PHEV-JT06-infected BALB/c mice supported the diagnosis of PHEV infection. The five full-length PHEV-JT06 structural genes were cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic studies based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the five genes in the outbreak showed that PHEV remained genetically stable. PHEV shares 95.3-99.3 % amino acid sequence identity with American strains (AY078417), suggesting that the Chinese isolate is most likely derived from the North American strain. Additionally, PHEV, HCoV-OC43 and BCoV were genetically close. These results may provide some insights into the genotype of the etiological agent responsible for the porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis outbreak and could also provide a comparative view of the genomics of the five structural proteins of PHEV.","publish_time":"2014-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Bo; Lu, Huijun; Zhao, Kui; Liu, Wenfeng; Gao, Wei; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Jiakuan; Tang, Bo; Song, Deguang; He, Wenqi; Gao, Feng","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/068d29de8bce9086f78d5190df43c5f828e47314.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087033.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756345/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2070-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PHEV shares","designated PHEV-JT06","structural proteins of PHEV","diagnosis of PHEV infection","full-length PHEV-JT06 structural genes","porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis outbreak","Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","acute outbreak of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis","virus isolate","amino acid sequences","amino acid sequence identity","weaning pigs","American strains","Chinese isolate","North American strain","positive labeling of neurons","c mice","etiological agent responsible","nervous symptoms","cerebral cortex","infected BALB","farm","immunohistochemical stain","AY078417","nucleotide","clinical signs","RT-PCR assays","genotype","genomics","Jilin province","BCoV","suckling","HCoV-OC43","particles","insights","China","Phylogenetic studies","comparative view","electron microscopy","study","Coronavirus","results"],"language":"en"},

Method We assessed the effectiveness of convalescent whole blood (CWB) in the treatment of consented EVD patients. We recruited 69 subjects in December 2014 up to April 2015, at the 34 Military Hospital in Wilberforce and the PTS 1 Ebola Treatment Unit in Hastings, Freetown. Forty-four were given CWB, and 25 who consented but preferred to be exempted from the CWB treatment were used to compare clinical outcomes. All were given routine treatment used at the Ebola Treatment Unit. Results One of 44 subjects treated with CWB dropped out of the study and 31 recovered while 12 succumbed to the disease with a case fatality rate of 27.9%. For the group that was given routine treatment without CWB, 11 died with a case fatality rate of 44%. There was a significant difference between admission viral load and viral load after the first 24 h of treatment with convalescent whole blood (P \u003C 0.01). The odds ratio for survival with CWB was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.8\u20136.5). Conclusion CWB is promising for treating EVD in resource-poor settings, especially in the early phases of outbreaks when resource-mobilization is done. Even though our sample size was small and the evaluation was not randomised, our results contribute to existing evidence that convalescent whole blood could be considered as a useful candidate for treating EVD. Further studies that are randomised will be required to further assess the efficacy of CWB as treatment option during any EVD outbreak.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahr, F.; Ansumana, R.; Massaquoi, T.

This chapter focuses on two aspects of the host response to pathogens where major advances are being made using genomic approaches. The availability of complete genomic sequences of an expanding number of pathogens, the human and mouse genome sequences, and the advent of genome-wide genotyping and gene expression profiling has opened up new avenues of investigation in the field. The genotype of the pathogen plays a major role in the response of the host to infection with more virulent pathogenic strains possessing the capability to interfere with the host immune response. In addition, different individuals in a population can have very different responses to a genetically identical pathogen. Part of the differential response is governed by the underlying genetic differences between individuals. The advent of genome-wide genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms or microsatellite markers is leading to major advances in molecular epidemiology. The future impact of genomic approaches on the development of diagnostics and therapeutics is discussed for infectious diseases. This includes defining the basis of genetic susceptibility to infection and system-wide molecular response to a pathogen.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shannon, M.

These analytes were administered intravenously or intragastrically to male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, and the influence of 3(R/S)-configuration on the pharmacokinetics of both epimers in rat plasma was elucidated. The analytes and an internal standard (i.e., sinigrin) were resolved by LC\u2013MS/MS on a reverse-phase ACQUITY UPLCTM HSS T3 column equilibrated and eluted with acetonitrile and water (0.1% formic acid) at a \uFB02ow rate of 0.3 mL/min.

We also investigated the host transcriptome using RNA-Seq combined with differential gene expression analysis, biological pathway analysis, and gene ontology analysis. We identify numerous novel spliced and unspliced transcripts of MCMV. Unexpectedly, the most abundantly transcribed viral genes are of unknown function. We found that the most abundant viral transcript, recently identified as a noncoding RNA regulating cellular microRNAs, also codes for a novel protein. To our knowledge, this is the first viral transcript that functions both as a noncoding RNA and an mRNA. We also report that lytic infection elicits a profound cellular response in fibroblasts. Highly upregulated and induced host genes included those involved in inflammation and immunity, but also many unexpected transcription factors and host genes related to development and differentiation. Many top downregulated and repressed genes are associated with functions whose roles in infection are obscure, including host long intergenic noncoding RNAs, antisense RNAs or small nucleolar RNAs. Correspondingly, many differentially expressed genes cluster in biological pathways that may shed new light on cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. Together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular warfare at the virus-host interface and suggest new areas of research to advance the understanding and treatment of cytomegalovirus-associated diseases.","publish_time":"2013-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juranic Lisnic, Vanda; Babic Cac, Marina; Lisnic, Berislav; Trsan, Tihana; Mefferd, Adam; Das Mukhopadhyay, Chitrangada; Cook, Charles H.; Jonjic, Stipan; Trgovcich, Joanne","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/187062df058ff8a8110c008bc1f489986423ea1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3784481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24086132/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003611","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Murine Cytomegalovirus","MCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced host genes","host transcriptome","host gene products","transcribed viral genes","lytic infection","repressed genes","genes cluster","gene ontology analysis","virus-host interface","host cell transcriptomes","sequencing of viral transcripts","knowledge of pathogen genes","RNA-Seq","differential gene expression analysis","MCMV transcriptome","biological pathway analysis","intergenic noncoding RNAs","unspliced transcripts of MCMV","abundant viral transcript","dual analysis of Murine Cytomegalovirus","antisense RNAs","generation sequencing of transcripts","new light","new insights","treatment of cytomegalovirus","cytomegalovirus pathogenesis","Major gaps","functions","small nucleolar RNAs","new areas of research","biological pathways","cellular microRNAs","major obstacle","numerous novel","novel protein","associated diseases","antiviral drug development","profound cellular response","progress","classical cDNA cloning","vaccine","molecular warfare","understanding","codes","unexpected transcription factors","unknown function","roles","immunity","herpesviruses","fibroblasts","findings","inflammation","differentiation","mRNA"],"language":"en"},

The study of RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defences in vertebrates is hampered by the overlap with other antiviral mechanisms; thus, heterologous systems are often used to study the interplay between RNA silencing and vertebrate-infecting viruses. In this report we show that the VP3 protein of the avian birnavirus Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) displays, in addition to its capacity to bind long double-stranded RNA, the ability to interact with double-stranded small RNA molecules. We also demonstrate that IBDV VP3 prevents the silencing mediated degradation of a reporter mRNA, and that this silencing suppression activity depends on its RNA binding ability. Furthermore, we find that the anti-silencing activity of IBDV VP3 is shared with the homologous proteins expressed by both insect- and fish-infecting birnaviruses. Finally, we show that IBDV VP3 can functionally replace the well-characterized HCPro silencing suppressor of Plum pox virus, a potyvirus that is unable to infect plants in the absence of an active silencing suppressor. Altogether, our results support the idea that VP3 protects the viral genome from host sentinels, including those of the RNA silencing machinery.","publish_time":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valli, Adrian; Busnadiego, Idoia; Maliogka, Varvara; Ferrero, Diego; Cast\u00F3n, Jos\u00E9 R.; Rodr\u00EDguez, Jos\u00E9 Francisco; Garc\u00EDa, Juan Antonio","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a1329845e6f9569ebad76566c23cf88fd8d5508.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3458112.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23049903/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","IBDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of RNA silencing","RNA silencing machinery","anti-silencing activity of IBDV VP3","active silencing suppressor","silencing suppression activity","silencing mediated degradation","RNA binding ability","VP3 protein","long double-stranded RNA","small RNA molecules","well-characterized HCPro silencing suppressor of Plum pox virus","antiviral defense","plants","antiviral mechanisms","antiviral defences","vertebrate-infecting viruses","vertebrate animals","fish-infecting birnaviruses","avian birnavirus Infectious bursal disease virus","wide variety of eukaryotic organisms","reporter mRNA","insect","fungi","viral genome","potyvirus","absence","invertebrates","capacity","idea","host sentinels","homologous proteins","heterologous systems","overlap","addition","interplay","results"],"language":"en"},

PARTICIPANT AND METHODS: A 30-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral acute conjunctivitis which occurred 13 days after illness onset. Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs. The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated. RESULTS: Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen 13 days after onset (cycle threshold value: 31). The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset. On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness. Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection. However, conjunctival sampling might not be useful for early diagnosis because the virus may not appear initially in the conjunctiva.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Lu; Liu, Meizhou; Zhang, Zheng; Qiao, Kun; Huang, Ting; Chen, Miaohong; Xin, Na; Huang, Zuliang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Guoming; Wang, Jiantao","journal":"Br J Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6187b60c12c045053000aaeb68474901074ab23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211077.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32265202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","conjunctival specimens","viral conjunctivitis","viral dynamics of SARS","conjunctival swab specimens","conjunctival sampling","conjunctival swabs","days","bilateral acute conjunctivitis","RT-PCR result","RT-PCR assay","ocular characteristics","illness onset","presence of viral RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis","reverse transcription PCR","confirmed COVID","ocular complications","Slit lamp examination","detailed ophthalmic examination","novel coronavirus disease","middle phase of illness","infected patients","cycle threshold value","clinical course","year-old man","RESULTS","early diagnosis","METHODS","Precautionary measures","infection","PURPOSE","CONCLUSION","PARTICIPANT"],"language":"en"},

To date, there is no effective vaccine or antibody for human immunity and treatment, other than the safety and tolerability of the fully human polyclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (SAB-301) as a putative therapeutic agent specific for MERS. Although rapid diagnostic and public health measures are currently being implemented, new cases of MERS-CoV infection are still being reported. Therefore, various effective measures should be taken to prevent the serious impact of similar epidemics in the future. Further investigation of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the virus, as well as the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic anti-MERS-CoV infections, is necessary. For this purpose, detailed information on MERS-CoV proteins is needed. In this review, we describe the major structural and nonstructural proteins of MERS-CoV and summarize different potential strategies for limiting the outbreak of MERS-CoV. The combination of computational biology and virology can accelerate the advanced design and development of effective peptide therapeutics against MERS-CoV. In summary, this review provides important information about the progress of the elimination of MERS, from prevention to treatment.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yan-Hua; Hu, Chen-Yu; Wu, Nan-Ping; Yao, Hang-Ping; Li, Lan-Juan","journal":"Engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31c984803a0d9f243445e5ff6657edfc9ee5cde6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104727.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2018.11.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809918307598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288963/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095809918307598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV proteins","outbreak of MERS","elimination of MERS","nonstructural proteins of MERS","prophylactic anti-MERS-CoV infections","new cases of MERS","development of effective therapeutic","effective vaccine","various effective measures","development of effective peptide therapeutics","antibody","review","treatment","human immunity","detailed information","important information","viral respiratory disease","public health measures","human polyclonal Immunoglobulin G","putative therapeutic agent specific","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome","IgG","advanced design","virology","progress","different potential strategies","novo coronavirus","rapid diagnostic","tolerability","SAB","serious impact of similar epidemics","combination of computational biology","epidemiology","pathogenesis","future","summary","safety","prevention","purpose","humans","investigation","date","mechanism","high mortality"],"language":"en"},

Sixteen, 3\u20134 week-old piglets, from a PRRSv and Aujeszky disease virus (ADV) free herd were used. Animals were equally and randomly allocated in four groups which were treated according the following schedule: Group I: negative controls; Group II: inoculation with only PRRSV; Group III: inoculation with PRRSV and P. multocida; Group IV: inoculation with ADV and P. multocida (positive controls). PRRSV and ADV were inoculated intranasally, at the doses of 104.6 and 104.5 TCID50/ml, respectively. Five days later, pigs from groups III and IV were inoculated intranasally, with two ml of a 109 CFU/ml suspension of equal parts of P. multocida, strains A52 and A24. No lesions were observed in piglets of group I. Microscopically, interstitial pneumonia was identified in all piglets of groups II and III and 3 4 piglets from group IV. Bronchopneumonia was detected in 3 4 of the piglets from group III and in all animals of group IV which, additionally, showed meningo-encephalitis and purulent rhinitis. Macroscopically, only piglets of groups III and IV had lung consolidation. However, much lower pneumonic scores (2.3%) were observed in group III, where 3 of 4 piglets were affected. On the other hand, all piglets of group IV showed some degree of pulmonary consolidation, with a mean score of 13.7%. Based on these results, it appears that the role of PRRSV as a initiator of secondary diseases is still undefined, but is probably mild. There was no clear interaction between PRRSv and Pasteurella multocida under the conditions and strains tested here.","publish_time":"1997-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carvalho, Luiz F.O.S.; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim; Pijoan, Carlos","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92b61fdd869f937cb90fcfdc5cf5994e6d7bdaa0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113596013247; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113596013247","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pasteurella","IV"],"organizations":["ADV","I.

We report here a refined workflow that combines ZipTip desalting, acetonitrile precipitation, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis for the profiling, purification and identification of the targeted serum proteins found by SELDI-TOF-MS. By using this workflow, we purified ten targeted proteins from the sera of patients with various types of advanced stage (stage III\u2013IV) cancers. These proteins were identified as isoforms of the human serum amyloid protein A (SAA) family with or without truncations at their N-terminals. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Different SAA expression patterns were observed by MALDI-TOF-MS profiling. SAA has long been reported as a biomarker for various cancer types such as lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. However, in this study we found increased SAA expression in the sera of advanced-stage cancer patients with different cancer types.

RESULTS: The fluorescence and gel electrophoresis experiments revealed a tight self-assembly of TMD in the model membrane. A weak but non-random interaction between TMD and FP in the membrane was found. In the complex, the central TMD oligomer was packed by FP in an antiparallel fashion. FP insertion into the membrane was altered by binding to TMD. An infrared study exhibited an enhanced membrane perturbation by the complex formation. A model was built to illustrate the role of TMD in the late stages of influenza virus-mediated membrane fusion reaction. CONCLUSION: The TMD oligomer anchors the fusion protein in the membrane with minimal destabilization to the membrane. Upon associating with FP, the complex exerts a synergistic effect on the membrane perturbation. This effect is likely to contribute to the complete membrane fusion during the late phase of fusion protein-induced fusion cascade. The results presented in the work characterize the nature of the interaction of TMD with the membrane and TMD in a complex with FP in the steps leading to pore initiation and dilation during virus-induced fusion. Our data and proposed fusion model highlight the key role of TMD-FP interaction and have implications on the fusion reaction mediated by other type I viral fusion proteins. Understanding the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion may assist in the design of anti-viral drugs.","publish_time":"2008-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Ding-Kwo; Cheng, Shu-Fang; Kantchev, Eric Aseen B; Lin, Chi-Hui; Liu, Yu-Tsan","journal":"BMC Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f7c34653f6fcd0675f13b47461b74cd0f0a51fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2267159.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-6-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18197965/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complete membrane fusion","fusion model","fusion domain","fusion peptide","fusion cascade","model membrane","interaction of TMD","molecular mechanism of membrane fusion","virus-induced fusion","viral fusion proteins","FP interaction","sperm-egg fusion","enhanced membrane perturbation","late phase of fusion protein","late stages of influenza virus-mediated membrane fusion reaction","key role of TMD","central TMD oligomer","tight self-assembly of TMD","FP insertion","non-random interaction","complex formation","RESULTS","influenza virus envelope glycoprotein","transmembrane domain","synergistic effect","infrared study","design of anti-viral drugs","gel electrophoresis experiments","dilation","cellular trafficking of biomolecules","pore initiation","steps","type","implications","minimal destabilization","fluorescence","organization","work","nature","antiparallel fashion","CONCLUSION","associating","data","binding","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Prior to this study, no information was available concerning the incidence and prevalence of these viruses in Cape Verde archipelago. RESULTS: To provide information regarding the health status of the canine population in Vila do Maio, Maio Island, Cape Verde, 53 rectal swabs were collected from 53 stray dogs during 2010 and 93 rectal swabs and 88 blood samples were collected from 125 stray dogs in 2011. All rectal swabs (2010 n = 53; 2011 n = 93) were analysed for the presence of canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus nucleic acids by quantitative PCR methods. Specific antibodies against canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus were also assessed (2011 n = 88). From the 2010 sampling, 43.3% (23/53) were positive for canine parvovirus DNA, 11.3% (6/53) for canine distemper virus RNA and 1.9% (1/53) for canine coronavirus RNA. In 2011, the prevalence values for canine parvovirus and canine coronavirus were quite similar to those from the previous year, respectively 44.1% (41/93), and 1.1% (1/93), but canine distemper virus was not detected in any of the samples analysed (0%, 0/93). Antibodies against canine parvovirus were detected in 71.6% (63/88) blood samples and the seroprevalence found for canine distemper virus was 51.1% (45/88). CONCLUSIONS: This study discloses the data obtained in a molecular and serological epidemiological surveillance carried out in urban populations of stray and domestic animals. Virus transmission and spreading occurs easily in large dog populations leading to high mortality rates particularly in unvaccinated susceptible animals. In addition, these animals can act as disease reservoirs for wild animal populations by occasional contact. Identification of susceptible wildlife of Maio Island is of upmost importance to evaluate the risk of pathogen spill over from domestic to wild animals in Cape Verde and to evaluate the associated threat to the wild susceptible species.","publish_time":"2014-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castanheira, Pedro; Duarte, Ana; Gil, Solange; Cartaxeiro, Clara; Malta, Manuel; Vieira, Sara; Tavares, Luis","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31a744d5cdf4b8901ea26a847bbc3cc76d6e02d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4005843.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-91; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cape Verde","Maio Island"],"keyphrases":["canine population","presence of canine parvovirus","canine parvovirus DNA","canine distemper virus RNA","canine coronavirus RNA","canine coronavirus nucleic acids","Virus transmission","wild animals","domestic animals","rectal swabs","stray dogs","unvaccinated susceptible animals","blood samples","wild animal populations","urban populations of stray","Cape Verde archipelago","wild susceptible species","Identification of susceptible wildlife of Maio Island","information","study","large dog populations","prevalence values","Specific antibodies","high mortality rates","important cause of mortality","Vila","quantitative PCR methods","disease reservoirs","associated threat","serological epidemiological surveillance","upmost importance","viruses","seroprevalence","occasional contact","health status","data","risk of pathogen","incidence","morbidity","Infections","BACKGROUND","previous year","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","addition","sampling"],"language":"en"},

In the virulent Miller strain of TGEV, ORF 3b is 5\u2032-terminal on mRNA 3\u20131 and is presumably translated following 5\u2032 cap-dependent ribosomal entry. For three other strains of TGEV, the virulent British FS772/70 and Taiwanese TFI and avirulent Purdue-116, mRNA species 3\u20131 is not made and ORF 3b is present as a non-overlapping second ORF on mRNA 3. ORF 3b begins at base 432 on mRNA 3 in Purdue strain. In vitro expression of ORF 3b from Purdue mRNA 3-like transcripts did not fully conform to a predicted leaky scanning pattern, suggesting ribosomes might also be entering internally. With mRNA 3-like transcripts modified to carry large ORFs upstream of ORF 3a, it was demonstrated that ribosomes can reach ORF 3b by entering at a distant downstream site in a manner resembling ribosomal shunting. Deletion analysis failed to identify a postulated internal ribosomal entry structure (IRES) within ORF 3a. The results indicate that an internal entry mechanism, possibly in conjunction with leaky scanning, is used for the expression of ORF 3b from TGEV mRNA 3. One possible consequence of this feature is that ORF 3b might also be expressed from mRNAs 1 and 2.","publish_time":"2000-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Connor, Jennifer Black; Brian, David A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96454b22b4c649398a3d7763603fec0faa9beb4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200902186; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200902186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","TGEV"],"locations":["Purdue"],"keyphrases":["expression of ORF","TGEV mRNA","Purdue mRNA","mRNA species","strains of TGEV","Purdue strain","virulent Miller strain of TGEV","kDa","postulated internal ribosomal entry structure","internal entry mechanism","avirulent Purdue","cap-dependent ribosomal entry","ribosomal shunting","ribosomes","transcripts","predicted leaky scanning pattern","virulent British FS772","IRES","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","Taiwanese TFI","putative nonstructural polypeptide","unknown function","manner","conjunction","glycosylated integral membrane protein","non-overlapping","distant downstream site","translation","feature","base","Abstract Gene","results","large ORFs","Deletion analysis","possible consequence","terminal","mRNAs"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that pulmonary infection can be excluded based on clinical and laboratory data and that bronchoscopy with BAL is not mandatory in the diagnostic work-up of suspected AEX-IPF. METHODS: In this retrospective study we identified patients with acute respiratory failure who were evaluated for AEX-IPF at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2002 and December 2011. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed with predefined risk factors and final diagnosis of AEX-IPF and pulmonary infection. All tests were performed at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients met the study inclusion criteria. Of these patients 47 (61 %) were diagnosed with AEX-IPF. Bronchoscopy was more likely to be performed in patients who were on cytotoxic medications (p \u003C 0.05). In most cases the diagnosis of AEX-IPF versus pulmonary infection was based on combination of other microbiological, clinical, radiologic data and clinical judgment. A total of 10 patients out of 14 (71 %) with a final diagnosis of pulmonary infection were on steroids on admission versus 21 out of 63 patients (33 %) with other final diagnosis (p = 0.024, OR 7.817, 95 % CI 1.31\u201346.64). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusion of infection in our IPF patient cohort was mostly based on factors other than diagnostic bronchoscopy with BAL. Based on our results we suggested an algorithm for management of IPF patients presenting with acute respiratory failure.","publish_time":"2015-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrosyan, Frunze; Culver, Daniel A.; Reddy, Anita J.","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/585dfd73677d0d5a4f05df3bef78b997c42dbfcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4702317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26160310/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-015-0066-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of IPF patients","suspected AEX-IPF","final diagnosis of pulmonary infection","final diagnosis of AEX","IPF patient cohort","acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","Exclusion of infection","acute respiratory failure","experience acute clinical deteriorations","clinical judgment","diagnostic bronchoscopy","RESULTS","total","radiologic data","laboratory data","retrospective study","diagnostic work","predefined risk factors","study inclusion criteria","BAL","multivariate analysis","previous stability","algorithm","combination","steroids","admission","cytotoxic medications","Cleveland Clinic","cases","tests","significance level","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","CI"],"language":"en"},

With the incorporation of medical imaging modalities, a clinical laboratory modeled after those existing in hospitals, and a highly trained veterinary medicine team, IRF Frederick is uniquely suited to advance our understanding of emerging infectious diseases and to facilitate the development of medical countermeasures and clinical care paradigms previously considered impossible.","publish_time":"2014-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jahrling, Peter B.; Keith, Lauren; St. Claire, Marisa; Johnson, Reed F.; Bollinger, Laura; Lackemeyer, Matthew G.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Kindrachuk, Jason; Kuhn, Jens H.","journal":"Pathogens and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf5f96018b87c6571368db7af439ff89c6e9cc5d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3f08d3c1f07751d8d55bf6a331b38ae652c7f833.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4106974.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/femspd/article-pdf/71/2/213/17943223/71-2-213.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1111/2049-632x.12171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687975/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRF Frederick"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of medical countermeasures","molecular medical imaging equipment","Infectious Diseases Integrated Research Facility","incorporation of medical imaging modalities","understanding of emerging infectious diseases","clinical laboratory","test candidate countermeasures","advanced molecular imaging","investigators","alternative endpoints","preclinical research","human disease","IRF Frederick","disease pathogenesis","unique tools","sublethal models","clinical care paradigms","ability of animal models","maximum containment laboratory","Fort Detrick","world","Maryland coordinate","National Institute of Allergy","potential","trained veterinary medicine team","experiments","high consequence pathogens","number of animals","Scientists","hospitals","capability","lethality","design"],"language":"en"},

While several PARPs have known antiviral activities, these activities are mostly independent of ADP-ribosylation. Consequently, less is known about the antiviral effects of ADP-ribosylation. Several viral families, including Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, encode for macrodomain proteins that bind to and hydrolyze ADP-ribose from proteins and are critical for optimal replication and virulence. These results suggest that macrodomains counter cellular ADP-ribosylation, but whether PARPs or, alternatively, other ADP-ribosyltransferases cause this modification is not clear. Here we show that pan-PARP inhibition enhanced replication and inhibited interferon production in primary macrophages infected with macrodomain-mutant but not wild-type coronavirus. Specifically, knockdown of two abundantly expressed PARPs, PARP12 and PARP14, led to increased replication of mutant but did not significantly affect wild-type virus. PARP14 was also important for the induction of interferon in mouse and human cells, indicating a critical role for this PARP in the regulation of innate immunity. In summary, these data demonstrate that the macrodomain is required to prevent PARP-mediated inhibition of coronavirus replication and enhancement of interferon production.","publish_time":"2019-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grunewald, Matthew E.; Chen, Yating; Kuny, Chad; Maejima, Takashi; Lease, Robert; Ferraris, Dana; Aikawa, Masanori; Sullivan, Christopher S.; Perlman, Stanley; Fehr, Anthony R.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e2cac5308e11493311bc4a3e8d15c9b9e7885ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6521996.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095648/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007756","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADP-ribose","ADP-ribosyltransferases","polymers of ADP","independent of ADP","PARPs","antiviral effects of ADP","macrodomains counter cellular ADP-ribosylation","macrodomain proteins","induction of interferon","optimal replication","macrodomain-mutant","PARP-mediated inhibition of coronavirus replication","inhibited interferon production","enhancement of interferon production","increased replication of mutant","pan-PARP inhibition","wild-type coronavirus","antiviral activities","PARP14","interferon-inducible diphtheria toxin","wild-type virus","critical role","monomers","primary macrophages","ubiquitous post-translational addition","human cells","Coronaviridae","Togaviridae","enzymes","mouse","results","Hepeviridae","regulation of innate immunity","viral families","PARP12","virulence","modification","data","summary","knockdown"],"language":"en"},

Here we tested the effects of 15 GL derivatives against EBV infection by scoring the numbers of cell expressing viral antigens and quantifying EBV DNA copy numbers in superinfected Raji cells. The derivatives were made either by transformation of GL on carboxyl and hydroxyl groups or by conjugation of amino acid residues into the carbohydrate part. We identified seven compounds active against EBV and all showed dose-dependent inhibition as determined by both assays. Among these active compounds, the introduction of amino acid residues into the GL carbohydrate part enhanced the antiviral activity in three of the seven active compounds. However, when Glu(OH)-OMe was substituted by Glu(OMe)-OMe, its antiviral activity was completely abolished.

In a further approach we applied nebulized detergents into the airways of human cadavers and detected the simulated spread on the same way. Among others we did recordings with undergoing compression-only-CPR, with a surgical mask or an oxygen mask on the patients face and with an inserted supraglottic airway device with and without a connected airway filter. Results Most aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask and of an oxygen mask on the patient\u0027s face deflected the spread.

Non-human primates (NHP), in particular rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, serve as animal models for influenza and experimental FLUAV infection of common marmosets has recently also been reported. However, it is currently unknown whether the NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2 cleave and activate FLUAV hemagglutinin and contribute to viral spread in respiratory tissue. Here, we cloned and functionally analyzed the macaque and marmoset orthologues of human TMPRSS2. In addition, we analyzed the macaque orthologues of human TMPRSS4 and HAT, which also belong to the TTSP family. We found that all NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT cleave and activate HA upon directed expression and provide evidence that endogenous TMPRSS2 is expressed in the respiratory epithelium of rhesus macaques. Finally, we demonstrate that a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 suppresses FLUAV spread in precision-cut lung slices of human, macaque and marmoset origin. These results indicate that FLUAV depends on serine protease activity for spread in diverse NHP and in humans. Moreover, our findings suggest that macaques and marmosets may serve as models to study FLUAV activation by TMPRSS2 in human patients.","publish_time":"2017-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zmora, Pawel; Molau-Blazejewska, Paulina; Bertram, Stephanie; Walendy-Gnir\u00DF, Kerstin; Nehlmeier, Inga; Hartleib, Anika; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Konzok, Sebastian; Dehmel, Susann; Sewald, Katherina; Brinkmann, Constantin; Curths, Christoph; Knauf, Sascha; Gruber, Jens; M\u00E4tz-Rensing, Kerstin; Dahlmann, Franziska; Braun, Armin; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17413f651645c2b9c92555e9ce1404b9290eccab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5426610.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493964/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176597","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TTSP","FLUAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2","marmoset orthologues of human TMPRSS2","FLUAV hemagglutinin","diverse FLUAV","endogenous TMPRSS2","cellular serine protease TMPRSS2","human patients","macaque orthologues of human TMPRSS4","study FLUAV activation","transmembrane serine protease","lung slices of human","serine protease activity","Non-human primates","diverse NHP","serine protease inhibitor active","experimental FLUAV infection of common marmosets","viral spread","hemagglutinin of influenza","HAT","cynomolgus macaques","respiratory epithelium of rhesus macaques","TTSP family","animal models","particular rhesus","respiratory tissue","marmoset origin","member","type","directed expression","evidence","viruses","precision","cell culture","findings","humans","mice","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

In July 2013, rabies was confirmed among three wild ferret-badgers, prompting public health response to prevent human rabies cases. This descriptive study reports the immediate response to the reemergence of rabies in Taiwan. Response included enhanced surveillance for human rabies cases by testing stored cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with encephalitides of unknown cause by RT-PCR, prioritizing vaccine use for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) during periods of vaccine shortage and subsequent expansion of PEP, surveillance of animal bites using information obtained from vaccine application, roll out of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with vaccine stock restoration, surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI), and ensuring surge capacity to respond to general public inquiries by phone and training for healthcare professionals. Enhanced surveillance for human rabies found no cases after testing 205 stored CSF specimens collected during January 2010\u2013July 2013. During July 16 to December 28, 2013, we received 8,241 rabies PEP application; 6,634 (80.5%) were consistent with recommendations. Among the 6,501persons who received at least one dose of rabies vaccine postexposure, 4,953 (76.2%) persons who were bitten by dogs; only 59 (0.9%) persons were bitten by ferret-badgers. During the study period, 6,247 persons received preexposure prophylaxis. There were 23 reports of AEFI; but no anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were found. During the study period, there were 40,312 calls to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control hotline, of which, 8,692 (22%) were related to rabies. Recent identification of rabies among ferret-badgers in a previously rabies-free country prompted rapid response. To date, no human rabies has been identified. Continued multifaceted surveillance and interministerial collaboration are crucial to achieve the goal of rabies-free status in Taiwan.","publish_time":"2015-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Angela Song-En; Chen, Wan-Chin; Huang, Wan-Ting; Huang, Shih-Tse; Lo, Yi-Chun; Wei, Sung-Hsi; Kuo, Hung-Wei; Chan, Pei-Chun; Hung, Min-Nan; Liu, Yu-Lun; Mu, Jung-Jung; Yang, Jyh-Yuan; Liu, Ding-Ping; Chou, Jih-Haw; Chuang, Jen-Hsiang; Chang, Feng-Yee","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae0144eb4ec61e7765eed001bc8a9c775cd31b67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4498755.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162074/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132160","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["goal of rabies","canine rabies","reemergence of rabies","human rabies cases","rabies PEP application","rabies-free country","animal rabies case","dose of rabies vaccine postexposure","Recent identification of rabies","persons","vaccine application","enhanced surveillance","multifaceted surveillance","free of indigenous human","surveillance of animal bites","postexposure prophylaxis","immediate response","preexposure prophylaxis","rapid response","Taiwan Centers","study period","prioritizing vaccine use","vaccine stock restoration","periods of vaccine shortage","public health response","wild ferret-badgers","free status","testing","descriptive study","reports of AEFI","subsequent expansion of PEP","stored CSF specimens","general public inquiries","RT-PCR","adverse events","cerebrospinal fluids","phone","training","patients","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","encephalitides of unknown cause","anaphylaxis","calls","PrEP","information","surge capacity","interministerial collaboration","acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","Disease Control hotline","immunization","healthcare professionals","date","recommendations","dogs"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, we highlight the measures implemented in the Arab region to address mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak; these tend to be insufficient when targeting the geriatric population. Finally, we provide short- and long-term recommendations to stakeholders that aim at enhancing the mental healthcare of older adults in the Arab countries of the MENA region, particularly during this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayek, Samer El; Cheaito, Mohamad Ali; Nofal, Marwa; Abdelrahman, Doaa; Adra, Ali; Shamli, Siham Al; AlHarthi, Mansour; AlNuaimi, Nawaf; Aroui, Chaimaa; Bensid, Lynda; Emberish, Alkhansa Mahdi; Larnaout, Amine; Radwan, Ahmed; Slaih, Mohammad; Sinawi, Hamed Al","journal":"Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9735c289f323e4edefb7532889f9fa56d35a52cf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1064748120303389; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748120303389?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["MENA","Middle East","North Africa"],"keyphrases":["Arab region","MENA region","geriatric mental health","Arab countries","outbreak","geriatric population","mental wellbeing","mental healthcare of older adults","COVID","status of geriatric psychiatry","resources","North Africa","Middle East","general public","field","stakeholders","influence","detrimental ramifications","long-term recommendations","null exposure","expertise","variations","topic","high risk","pandemic","measures","nation","review"],"language":"en"},

AIM: To review the influence of host genetic factors on the clinical course as well as on treatment response in patients with viral hepatitis. METHODS: Review of the literature. RESULTS: A landmark genome\u2010wide association study (GWAS) identified polymorphisms in the IL28B gene on chromosome 19 (19q13.13) associated with response to therapy with pegylated interferon\u2010\u03B1 (PEG\u2010IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) and spontaneous viral clearance in acute hepatitis C. Furthermore, IL28B genotype is associated with changes of lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. A further GWAS demonstrated that ITPA genetic variants protect HCV genotype 1 patients from RBV\u2010induced anaemia. Another polymorphism in the patatin\u2010like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) is associated with hepatic steatosis. Difficult\u2010to\u2010treat hepatitis C patients homozygous for GG had an up to five\u2010fold lower chance of viral clearance on PEG/RBV than non\u2010GG patients. In chronic hepatitis B patients treated with PEG\u2010IFN several retrospective analyses of IL28B rs12980275 and rs12979860 genotypes yielded conflicting results which can be explained by the heterogeneity between the study populations. Some variants of the HLA\u2010DP locus (HLA\u2010DPA1 A allele and HLA\u2010DPB1) protect against progression of chronic hepatitis B infection. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of IL28B polymorphisms may be useful to individualise treatment options when using PEG/RBV based therapies for chronic hepatitis C infection. In contrast, so far identified genetic factors play only a minor role in chronic hepatitis B infection.","publish_time":"2014-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"St\u00E4ttermayer, A.

Although some virus-encoded RNA helicases/chaperones have been predicted or identified, their RNA remodeling activities in vitro and functions in the viral life cycle remain largely elusive. Enteroviruses are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family, which includes numerous important human pathogens. Herein, we report that the nonstructural protein 2C(ATPase) of enterovirus 71 (EV71), which is the major causative pathogen of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and has been regarded as the most important neurotropic enterovirus after poliovirus eradication, functions not only as an RNA helicase that 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 unwinds RNA helices in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner, but also as an RNA chaperone that destabilizes helices bidirectionally and facilitates strand annealing and complex RNA structure formation independently of ATP. We also determined that the helicase activity is based on the EV71 2C(ATPase) middle domain, whereas the C-terminus is indispensable for its RNA chaperoning activity. By promoting RNA template recycling, 2C(ATPase) facilitated EV71 RNA synthesis in vitro; when 2C(ATPase) helicase activity was impaired, EV71 RNA replication and virion production were mostly abolished in cells, indicating that 2C(ATPase)-mediated RNA remodeling plays a critical role in the enteroviral life cycle. Furthermore, the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities of 2C(ATPase) are also conserved in coxsackie A virus 16 (CAV16), another important enterovirus. Altogether, our findings are the first to demonstrate the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities associated with enterovirus 2C(ATPase), and our study provides both in vitro and cellular evidence for their potential roles during viral RNA replication. These findings increase our understanding of enteroviruses and the two types of RNA remodeling activities.","publish_time":"2015-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Hongjie; Wang, Peipei; Wang, Guang-Chuan; Yang, Jie; Sun, Xianlin; Wu, Wenzhe; Qiu, Yang; Shu, Ting; Zhao, Xiaolu; Yin, Lei; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Hu, Yuanyang; Zhou, Xi","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f58cfab11be3906401550ffe0ba6e444d1056853.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4517893.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26218680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA helices","RNA structures","RNA chaperone","EV71 RNA replication","RNA chaperoning activity","EV71 RNA synthesis","mediated RNA remodeling","viral RNA replication","RNA-protein interactions","stranded RNA viruses","RNA template recycling","aspects of RNA metabolism","types of RNA remodeling activities","ATPase","virus-encoded RNA helicases","complex RNA structure formation","major classes of RNA remodeling proteins","C-terminus","helicase activity","chaperoning activities","important enterovirus","important neurotropic enterovirus","functions","chaperones","findings","enteroviral life cycle","numerous important human pathogens","understanding of enteroviruses","nonstructural protein","major causative pathogen of hand","critical role","Picornaviridae family","foot","potential roles","large group of positive","adenosine triphosphate","virion production","poliovirus eradication","middle domain","cellular evidence","dependent manner","CAV16","study","cells","coxsackie","mouth disease"],"language":"en"},

This study was carried out to evaluate the relationship between optical density ratio (ODR) measured on bulk tank milk with an indirect Ostertagia ostertagi ELISA and reproduction/mortality parameters. Data were collected between 2008 and 2010 from monitoring carried out on 1643 dairy herds (Normandy, Western France). ODR values of 3 samples from each farm taken from November 2008 to 2010 were averaged and then transformed into a categorical variable. Reproductive and mortality data were obtained from 1444 herds using cow records from government databases. Statistical analysis was carried out using ordinary logistic regression (OLR). The outcome variables were the case\u2013control status of a herd for reproductive factors, age at first calving and inter-calving intervals, and mortality ratios of various age classes. The effect of the categorical ODR variable was studied and several potential confounder herd factors were used to improve the model fit. A significant relationship was found between high Ostertagia ODR levels and a late age at the first calving (\u003E34.5 months) (odds ratio (OR)=1.94, p \u003C0.001). No significant relationship was observed with OLR for inter-calving intervals although bivariate analysis showed that herds with high ODR levels had longer inter-calving intervals than herds with low ODR level (first inter-calving interval in herds with low vs. high ODR levels=412 days vs. 422 days, p \u003C0.001; other inter-calving intervals=408 days vs. 413 days, p \u003C0.01). A high ODR level was also associated with high mortality of calves between 0 and 30 days of life (mortality ratio\u003E6%) (OR=1.43, p \u003C0.05) and between 91 and 365 days (ratio\u003E3%) (OR=1.72, p \u003C0.01). No significant relationship was observed with multivariate approach for mortalities in other classes by age, but bivariate analysis showed that herds with high ODR level had higher mortalities than herds with low ODR levels (mortality between 31 and 90 days in herds with low vs. high ODR levels=1.89% vs. 2.91%, p \u003C0.001; mortality after 365 days=1.67% vs. 2.93%, p \u003C0.001). In conclusion, our results confirm the usefulness of ELISA as an indicator for production losses in dairy herds. This inexpensive tool could be advantageous, used to aid farmers and veterinarians to carry out appropriate control measures.","publish_time":"2013-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delafosse, Arnaud","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3022dbbf60abb6d6eca4fdf971849eeefa6bb0b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131757.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401713003464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.05.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23806747/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401713003464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Western Europe"],"keyphrases":["high ODR levels","low ODR levels","high Ostertagia ODR levels","dairy herds","ODR values","inter-calving intervals","categorical ODR variable","high mortality of calves","mortality data","days of life","mortality parameters","significant relationship","mortality ratios of various age classes","bivariate analysis","late age","odds ratio","OLR","Statistical analysis","dairy cattle","reproductive factors","optical density ratio","categorical variable","indirect Ostertagia ostertagi ELISA","higher mortalities","usefulness of ELISA","control status","Western Europe","potential confounder herd factors","Western France","appropriate control measures","gastrointestinal nematodes","bulk tank milk","reproduction","indicator","case","production losses","multivariate approach","veterinarians","Abstract","ordinary logistic regression","cow records","government databases","Normandy","outcome variables","farmers","results","samples","months","effect","inexpensive tool","conclusion","monitoring","model fit","study"],"language":"en"},

As such, establishing baseline disease prevalence in vulnerable species where disease could affect persistence is important to conservation. We assessed potential disease threats to endangered red wolves (Canis rufus) by evaluating regional (southeastern United States) disease occurrences in mammals and parasite prevalence in red wolves and sympatric coyotes (Canis latrans) in North Carolina. Common viral pathogens in the southeast region, such as canine distemper and canine parvovirus, and numerous widespread endoparasites could pose a threat to the red wolf population. The most prevalent parasites in red wolves and sympatric coyotes were heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis), hookworm (Ancylostoma caninum), and Ehrlichia spp.; several red wolves and coyotes were also positive for bacteria causing Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). Coyotes had a more species-rich parasite community than red wolves, suggesting they could harbor more parasites and act as a disease reservoir. Species identity and sex did not significantly affect parasite loads, but young canids were less likely to have heartworm and more likely to have high levels of endoparasites. Continued disease monitoring is important for red wolf recovery because low levels of genetic variability may compromise the wolves\u2019 abilities to combat novel pathogens from closely related species, such as domestic dogs and coyotes.","publish_time":"2015-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brzeski, Kristin E.; Harrison, Rebecca B.; Waddell, William T.; Wolf, Karen N.; Rabon, David R.; Taylor, Sabrina S.","journal":"J Mammal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fefe3dac4d4fcdccbfc2aa97eacd6b45c5935a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107507.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyv080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","North Carolina"],"keyphrases":["red wolves","disease occurrences","Lyme disease","disease reservoir","sympatric coyotes","red wolf recovery","baseline disease prevalence","red wolf population","Continued disease monitoring","potential disease threats","parasite prevalence","vulnerable species","related species","Species identity","species-rich parasite community","heartworm","parasite loads","high levels of endoparasites","Canis latrans","canine distemper","canine parvovirus","Canis rufus","significant threat","novel pathogens","prevalent parasites","numerous widespread endoparasites","Common viral pathogens","low levels of genetic variability","mammals","Dirofilaria immitis","southeast region","southeastern United States","bacteria","wolves\u2019 abilities","hookworm","persistence","Ancylostoma caninum","global biodiversity","young canids","Borrelia burgdorferi","sex","domestic dogs","Ehrlichia","Infectious diseases","North Carolina","extinction","conservation"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that a 14 nucleotide sequence conserved between two families of Ty elements was necessary and sufficient to support ribosomal frameshifting. This work demonstrates that only 7 of these 14 nucleotides are needed for normal levels of frameshifting. Any change to the sequence CUU-AGG-C drastically reduces frameshifting; this suggests that two specific tRNAs, tRNALeu UAG and tRNAArg CCU, are involved in the event. Our tRNA overproduction data suggest that a leucyl-tRNA, probably tRNALeu UAG, an unusual leucine isoacceptor that recognizes all six leucine codons, slips from CUU-Leu onto UUA-Leu (in the \u002B1 reading frame) during a translational pause at the AGG-Arg codon induced by the low availability of tRNAArg CCU, encoded by a single-copy essential gene. Frameshifting is also directional and reading frame specific. Interestingly, frameshifting is inhibited when the \u201Cslip\u201D CUU codon is located three codons downstream, but not four or more codons downstream, of the translational initiation codon.","publish_time":"1990-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belcourt, Michael F.; Farabaugh, Philip J.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f65bd12c7c03725e764af2781e0142d6ea2a22c9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286749090371K; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/009286749090371K","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CUU codon","Abstract Ribosomal frameshifting","normal levels of frameshifting","CUU-Leu","leucine codons","sequence CUU-AGG","tRNALeu UAG","AGG-Arg codon","translational initiation codon","frame specific","low availability of tRNAArg CCU","leucyl-tRNA","translational pause","specific tRNAs","essential gene","UUA-Leu","nucleotide sequence","TYB gene of yeast Ty retrotransposons","unusual leucine isoacceptor","families of Ty elements","tRNA overproduction data","expression","change","nucleotides","event","work"],"language":"en"},

However, many aspects of CoV behavior, including modes of its transmission, are yet to be fully understood. We show that the amount and the peculiarities of distribution of the protein intrinsic disorder in the viral shell can be used for the efficient analysis of the behavior and transmission modes of CoV. The proposed model allows categorization of the various CoVs by the peculiarities of disorder distribution in their membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). This categorization enables quick identification of viruses with similar behaviors in transmission, regardless of genetic proximity. Based on this analysis, an empirical model for predicting the viral transmission behavior is developed. This model is able to explain some behavioral aspects of important coronaviruses that previously were not fully understood. The new predictor can be a useful tool for better epidemiological, clinical, and structural understanding of behavior of both newly emerging viruses and viruses that have been known for a long time. A potentially new vaccine strategy could involve searches for viral strains that are characterized by the evolutionary misfit between the peculiarities of the disorder distribution in their shells and their behavior.","publish_time":"2012-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

Within these replication complexes the polymerase activity is often highly regulated by RNA elements, proteins or other domains of multi-domain polymerases. Here, we present data of the influence of the methyltransferase domain (NS5-MTase) of dengue virus (DENV) protein NS5 on the RdRp activity of the polymerase domain (NS5-Pol). The steady-state polymerase activities of DENV-2 recombinant NS5 and NS5-Pol are compared using different biochemical assays allowing the dissection of the de novo initiation, transition and elongation steps of RNA synthesis. We show that NS5-MTase ensures efficient RdRp activity by stimulating the de novo initiation and the elongation phase. This stimulation is related to a higher affinity of NS5 toward the single-strand RNA template indicating NS5-MTase either completes a high-affinity RNA binding site and/or promotes the correct formation of the template tunnel. Furthermore, the NS5-MTase increases the affinity of the priming nucleotide ATP upon de novo initiation and causes a higher catalytic efficiency of the polymerase upon elongation. The complex stimulation pattern is discussed under the perspective that NS5 adopts several conformations during RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Potisopon, Supanee; Priet, St\u00E9phane; Collet, Axelle; Decroly, Etienne; Canard, Bruno; Selisko, Barbara","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7be0bfff671903d1176a2da34f16f1ff8189b554.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4191377.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25209234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS5-MTase","NS5-Pol","protein NS5","recombinant NS5","higher affinity of NS5","RNA elements","Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","single-strand RNA template","elongation steps of RNA synthesis","polymerase activity","polymerase domain","strand RNA virus genomes","novo initiation","high-affinity RNA binding site","replication of single","efficient RdRp activity","methyltransferase domain","elongation phase","steady-state polymerase activities of DENV","domains of multi-domain polymerases","context of complex replication machineries","complex stimulation pattern","dengue virus","template tunnel","higher catalytic efficiency","function","RdRps","transition","priming nucleotide ATP","dissection","proteins","influence","different biochemical assays","perspective","conformations","correct formation","present data"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, novel drugs for various neurological disorders are in desperate need. Recently, compelling evidence has demon-strated that chemokine receptor CXCR3, which is a G protein-coupled receptor in the CXC chemokine receptor family, may play a pivotal role in the development of neurological diseases. The aim of this review is to provide evidence for the potential of CXCR3 as a therapeutic target for neurological diseases. METHODS: English journal articles that focused on the invovlement of CXCR3 in neurological diseases were searched via PubMed up to May 2017. Moreover, reference lists from identified articles were included for overviews. RESULTS: The expression level of CXCR3 in T cells was significantly elevated in several neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), glioma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), chronic pain, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and bipolar disorder. CXCR3 antagonists showed therapeutic effects in these neurological diseases. CONCLUSION: These studies provided hard evidence that CXCR3 plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of MS, glioma, AD, chronic pain, HAM/TSP and bipolar disorder. CXCR3 is a crucial molecule in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. It regulates the activation of infiltrating cells and resident immune cells. However, the exact functions of CXCR3 in neurological diseases are inconclusive. Thus, it is important to understand the topic of chemokines and the scope of their ac-tivity in neurological diseases.","publish_time":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Ya-Qun; Liu, Dai-Qiang; Chen, Shu-Ping; Sun, Jia; Zhou, Xue-Rong; Xing, Cui; Ye, Da-Wei; Tian, Yu-Ke","journal":"Curr Neuropharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c92f5b237572a3461ae2205a62ba7622c07a6ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6343204.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29119926/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159x15666171109161140","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of neurological diseases","neurodegenerative diseases","invovlement of CXCR3","potential of CXCR3","CXCR3 antagonists","chemokine receptor CXCR3","various neurological disorders","expression level of CXCR3","exact functions of CXCR3","T cells","HAM","chronic pain","AD","glioma","TSP","therapeutic target","therapeutic effects","hard evidence","compelling evidence","bipolar disorder","CXC chemokine receptor family","resident immune cells","activation of infiltrating cells","insufficient therapeutic intervention","pathogenesis of MS","vital role","pivotal role","identified articles","English journal articles","human T-lymphotropic virus type","associated myelopathy","tropical spastic paraparesis","obvious challenge","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","crucial molecule","neuroinflammatory","demon","multiple sclerosis","ac-tivity","scope","novel drugs","desperate need","studies","G protein","topic of chemokines","reference lists","METHODS","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","overviews","review","BACKGROUND","PubMed","aim"],"language":"en"},

Exacerbations of COPD contribute to the severity of this pathology and accelerate disease progression. To date, pharmacological treatment of both stable COPD patients and patients experiencing exacerbations is mainly symptomatic with bronchodilators and steroids as the mainstay of therapy. Bacteria trigger such exacerbations in a number of cases; hence, antibiotics might be included in the treatment as well. Several respiratory viruses are frequently detected in sputum from patients during COPD exacerbations. These include influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and, most often, rhinoviruses. In this review, we discuss the potential use of an anti\u2010rhinovirus drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of rhinovirus\u2010induced COPD exacerbations and the path forward toward the development and use of such a drug.

The type and degree of the immune defect dictate the profile of potential opportunistic pathogens; T-cell-mediated defects increase the risk of viral (cytomegalovirus, respiratory viruses) and Pneumocystis jirovecii infections, whereas neutrophil defects are associated with bacterial pneumonia and invasive aspergillosis. However, patients often have combinations of immune defects, and a wide range of other opportunistic infections can cause pneumonia. Importantly, conventional non-opportunistic pathogens are frequently encountered in immunocompromised hosts and should not be overlooked. The radiological pattern of disease (best assessed by computed tomography) and speed of onset help to identify the likely pathogen(s); radiological imaging can subsequently be supported by targeted investigation including the early use of bronchoscopy in selected patients. Rapid and expert clinical assessment can identify the most likely pathogens, which can then be treated aggressively, providing the best opportunity for a positive clinical outcome.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jos\u00E9, Ricardo J.; Brown, Jeremy S.","journal":"Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea43b3a45db10d434d6093f623ba6034791fc8cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108286.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpmed.2016.03.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357303916300159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288579/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303916300159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunocompromised patients","Abstract Opportunistic infections","selected patients","likely pathogens","profile of potential opportunistic pathogens","conventional non-opportunistic pathogens","neutrophil defects","mediated defects","combinations of immune defects","Pneumocystis jirovecii infections","T-cell","bacterial pneumonia","radiological imaging","best opportunity","immunocompromised hosts","stem cell transplants","major cause of morbidity","positive clinical outcome","expert clinical assessment","radiological pattern of disease","haematological malignancy","HIV infection","recipients of solid","respiratory viruses","aplastic anaemia","risk of viral","early use of bronchoscopy","cytomegalovirus","organ","biological therapies","mortality","wide range","computed tomography","targeted investigation","speed of onset","chemotherapy","invasive aspergillosis","type","degree"],"language":"en"},

This polyprotein is proposed to be processed by two papain-like cysteine proteinases, PCP-1 and PCP-2, and a poliovirus 3C-like proteinase domain, 3C-pro, to generate protein products. The amino-terminal product of the MHV polymerase polyprotein, p28, is generated by cleavage of the polyprotein by PCP-1. To identify the viral products downstream of p28, we generated a fusion-protein specific antiserum directed against the region adjacent to p28 and used the antiserum to detect virus-specific proteins from MHV-JHM infected cells. When this antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins from MHV-JHM infected cell lysates, virus-specific proteins of 72 and 65 kDa were detected. Furthermore, pulse and chase experiments demonstrated that p72 is likely a precursor to the mature protein product, p65. To investigate which viral proteinase may be responsible for generating p72 and p65, we expressed the 5\u2032-region of the MHV-JHM RNA polymerase gene including the two papain-like cysteine proteinase domains in an in vitro transcription/translation system and analyzed the translation products for proteolytic processing. We also cloned and expressed the 72 kDa region immediately downstream from p28, and tested the ability of in vitro translated PCP-1 and PCP-2 to cleave p72 to p65 in trans. Our results indicate that neither viral proteinase domain PCP-1 nor PCP-2 is capable of cleavage of p72 to produce p65 in vitro. The role of MHV proteinases in the processing of p72 and p65 is discussed.","publish_time":"1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Hong-Qiang; Schiller, Jennifer J.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74afe9357aa764387a5a0ec524e83990232e838b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170296013688; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170296013688","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p65","MHV polymerase polyprotein","viral proteinase domain PCP","translated PCP","p28","processing of p72","MHV-JHM RNA polymerase gene","MHV-JHM infected cells","role of MHV proteinases","protein products","viral products","kDa region","MHV-JHM infected cell lysates","RNA polymerase gene of murine coronavirus MHV-JHM","virus-specific proteins","fusion-protein specific antiserum","translation products","polyprotein of greater","cysteine proteinase domains","radiolabeled proteins","papain","mature protein product","cysteine proteinases","region adjacent","translation system","C-pro","proteolytic processing","capable of cleavage","amino-terminal product","transcription","precursor","results","chase experiments","poliovirus","pulse","ability of"],"language":"en"},

The key epidemiological parameters and spatial heterogeneity of ZIKV epidemics in different states in Brazil remain unclear. Early prediction of the final epidemic (or outbreak) size for ZIKV outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making and mitigation planning. We investigated the spatial heterogeneity in the epidemiological features of ZIKV across eight different Brazilian states by using simple non-linear growth models. RESULTS: We fitted three different models to the weekly reported ZIKV cases in eight different states and obtained an R(2) larger than 0.995. The estimated average values of basic reproduction numbers from different states varied from 2.07 to 3.41, with a mean of 2.77. The estimated turning points of the epidemics also varied across different states. The estimation of turning points nevertheless is stable and real-time. The forecast of the final epidemic size (attack rate) is reasonably accurate, shortly after the turning point. The knowledge of the epidemic turning point is crucial for accurate real-time projection of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple models fitted the epidemic reasonably well and thus revealed the spatial heterogeneity in the epidemiological features across Brazilian states. The knowledge of the epidemic turning point is crucial for real-time projection of the outbreak size. Our real-time estimation framework is able to yield a reliable prediction of the final epidemic size.

In the presence of secondary infections, an understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus is crucial. The aim of this study was to characterize the transmission chains of MERS-CoV infection in the current South Korean outbreak. Methods Individual-level data from multiple sources were collected and used for epidemiological analyses. Results As of July 14, 2015, 185 confirmed cases of MERS have been reported in the Korean outbreak. Three generations of secondary infection, with over half belonging to the second generation, could be delineated. Hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of virus transmission, affecting largely non-healthcare workers (154/184). Healthcare switching has probably accounted for the emergence of multiple generations of secondary infection. Fomite transmission may explain a significant proportion of the infections occurring in the absence of direct contact with infected cases. Conclusions Publicly available data from multiple sources, including the media, are useful to describe the epidemic history of an outbreak. The effective control of MERS-CoV hinges on the upholding of infection control standards and an understanding of health-seeking behaviours in the community.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Shui Shan; Wong, Ngai Sze","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cee672ce206b0ed6e329b46353d19d50073a2752.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26216766/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2015.07.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971215001812; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971215001812","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","MERS-CoV","Hospital infection","transmission chains of MERS","emergence of multiple generations of secondary infection","multiple sources","upholding of infection control standards","transmission dynamics","Fomite transmission","effective control of MERS","confirmed cases of MERS","CoV hinges","important cause of virus transmission","current South Korean outbreak","presence of secondary infections","understanding of health","history of travel","available data","epidemic history","infected cases","Healthcare switching","case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","non-healthcare workers","Methods Individual-level data","absence of direct contact","significant proportion","year-old man","Conclusions","behaviours","study","media","half","Summary Background","community","epidemiological analyses","aim","Results"],"language":"en"},

This is evident by the recent 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the SARS outbreak, as well as the ever-present threat of global bioterrorism. Fortunately, the biomedical community has been able to rapidly generate sequence data so these pathogens can be readily identified. To date, however, the utilization of this sequence data to rapidly produce relevant experimental results or actionable treatments is lagging in spite of obtained sequence data. Thus, a pathogenic threat that has emerged and/or developed into a pandemic can be rapidly identified; however, translating this identification into a targeted therapeutic or treatment that is rapidly available has not yet materialized. This commentary suggests that the growing technology of DNA synthesis should be fully implemented as a means to rapidly generate in vivo data and possibly actionable therapeutics soon after sequence data becomes available.","publish_time":"2011-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Runco, Lisa M.; Coleman, J.

HCV entry into the hepatocytes is complex and involves several host factors. The tetraspanin human CD81 (hCD81) is one of the four essential entry factors and is composed of one large extracellular loop, one small extracellular loop, four transmembrane domains, one intracellular loop and two intracellular tails. The large extracellular loop interacts with the E2 glycoprotein of HCV. Regions outside the large extracellular loop (backbone) of hCD81 have a critical role in post-binding entry steps and determine susceptibility of hepatocytes to HCV. Here, we investigated the effect of five non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants in the backbone of hCD81 on HCV susceptibility. We generated cell lines that stably express the hCD81 variants and infected the cells using HCV pseudoparticles and cell culture-derived HCV. Our results show that all the tested hCD81 variants support HCV pseudoparticle entry with similar efficiency as wild-type hCD81. In contrast, variants A54V, V211M and M220I are less supportive to cell culture-derived HCV infection. This altered susceptibility is HCV genotype dependent and specifically affected the cell entry step. Our findings identify three hCD81 genetic variants that are impaired in their function as HCV host factors for specific viral genotypes. This study provides additional evidence that genetic host variation contributes to inter-individual differences in HCV infection and outcome.

Nucleos(t)ide analogs and interferons are the current standards of care due to their suppression of HBV replication, but the treatments rarely eradicate HBV from individuals. Similar to current treatments for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, improved HBV therapies will require the combination of multiple drugs which target distinct steps of the HBV life cycle. In this study, we tested the potential of a cyclophilin inhibitor, CRV431, to affect HBV replication in transgenic mice. We found that oral treatment with CRV431 (50 mg/kg/day) for a period of 16 days significantly reduced liver HBV DNA levels and moderately decreased serum HBsAg levels. We observed an additive inhibitory effect on liver HBV DNA levels in mice treated with a combination of low doses of CRV431 (10 mg/kg/day) and the nucleotide prodrug, tenofovir exalidex (TXL), (5 mg/kg/day). No toxicity was observed in CRV431-treated mice. Although it is well known that CRV431 neutralizes the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilins, its anti-HBV mechanism(s) of action remains unknown. Nevertheless, this study provides the first demonstration of a beneficial effect of a cyclophilin inhibitor in vivo in an HBV transgenic mouse model.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Open label, randomized trial to evaluate the immune response following H1N1pdm09 vaccination in HIV-infected participants compared to HIV-negative controls (NCT01155037). HIV-infected participants were randomized to receive 2 single (3.75 \u00B5g hemagglutinin) or 2 double (7.5 \u00B5g hemagglutinin) doses of the vaccine, 21 days apart. Controls received one dose of the vaccine. The primary endpoint was seroconversion as measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Two hundred fifty six HIV-infected participants (129 and 127 randomized to single and double doses, respectively) and 71 HIV-negative controls were enrolled. Among HIV-infected participants, seroconversion increased from 46.7% and 51.7% after the first dose to 77.2% and 83.8% after the second dose of the vaccine using single and double doses, respectively. Participants aged \u003E40 years showed higher seroconversion compared to younger participants. Seroconversion among HIV-infected women and those with nadir CD4\u003C200 cells/mm(3) was significantly higher with double doses. Persistence of protective antibodies six months after vaccination was achieved by 80% and 89.9% of the HIV-infected participants who received single and double doses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the recommendation of two double doses of adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine for HIV-infected individuals, particularly women, and those aged \u003E40 years or with nadir CD4\u003C200 cells/mm(3), to achieve antibody levels that are both higher and more sustained.

Though paid health care workers, like residents, nurses, and environmental services staff, are essential to the management of COVID-19 patients, medical students are not. Students\u2019 continued involvement in direct patient care will contribute to SARS-CoV-2 exposures and transmissions and will waste already limited personal protective equipment. By decreasing nonessential personnel in health care settings, including medical students, medical schools will contribute to national and global efforts to \u201Cflatten the curve.\u201D The authors also assert that medical schools are responsible for ensuring medical student safety. Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles. Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to \u201Cflatten the curve\u201D supersedes usual teaching responsibilities. Therefore, the authors request further guidance from the LCME and AAMC regarding curricular exemptions/alternatives and adjusted graduation timelines.

This article will discuss the current literature on the C\u2013C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and whether it is a therapeutic target in the context of various allergic, autoimmune or infectious diseases. Areas covered: Small-molecule inhibitors, chemokine and chemokine receptor-deficient mice, antibodies and modified chemokines are the current tools available for CCL5 research, and there are several ongoing clinical trials targeting the CCL5 receptors, CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5. There are fewer studies specifically targeting the chemokine itself and clinical studies with anti-CCL5 antibodies are still to be carried out. Expert opinion: Although clinical trials are strongly biased toward HIV treatment and prevention with blockers of CCR5, the therapeutic potential for CCL5 and its receptors in other diseases is relevant. Overall, it is not likely that specific targeting of CCL5 will result in new adjunct strategies for the treatment of infectious diseases with a major inflammatory component. However, targeting CCL5 could result in novel therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases, where it may decrease inflammatory responses and fibrosis, and certain solid tumors, where it may have a role in angiogenesis.","publish_time":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marques, Rafael Elias; Guabiraba, Rodrigo; Russo, Remo Castro; Teixeira, Mauro Martins","journal":"Expert Opin Ther Targets","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f2b6dba5fcb25ba7a248ebc6552379ac2ce474e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103722.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24090198/; https://doi.org/10.1517/14728222.2013.837886","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCL5 receptors","CCL5 research","specific targeting of CCL5","anti-CCL5 antibodies","treatment of infectious diseases","chronic inflammatory diseases","clinical studies","inflammatory responses","C chemokine ligand","ongoing clinical trials","chemokine receptor-deficient mice","major inflammatory component","modified chemokines","HIV treatment","current literature","blockers of CCR5","therapeutic potential","therapeutic target","immune responses","fewer studies","current tools available","context of various allergic","important roles","Small-molecule inhibitors","new adjunct strategies","inflammation","fibrosis","CCR1","novel therapies","certain solid tumors","prevention","CCR3","Areas","Introduction","Expert opinion","article","angiogenesis"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Cases presented in 4 healthcare facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: a tertiary-care hospital, a specialty pulmonary hospital, an outpatient clinic, and an outpatient dialysis unit. METHODS: Contact tracing and testing were performed following reports of cases at 2 hospitals. Laboratory results were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and/or genome sequencing. We assessed exposures and determined seropositivity among available healthcare personnel (HCP) cases and HCP contacts of cases. RESULTS: In total, 48 cases were identified, involving patients, HCP, and family members across 2 hospitals, an outpatient clinic, and a dialysis clinic. At each hospital, transmission was linked to a unique index case. Moreover, 4 cases were associated with superspreading events (any interaction where a case patient transmitted to \u22655 subsequent case patients). All 4 of these patients were severely ill, were initially not recognized as MERS-CoV cases, and subsequently died. Genomic sequences clustered separately, suggesting 2 distinct outbreaks. Overall, 4 (24%) of 17 HCP cases and 3 (3%) of 114 HCP contacts of cases were seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: We describe 2 distinct healthcare-associated outbreaks, each initiated by a unique index case and characterized by multiple superspreading events. Delays in recognition and in subsequent implementation of control measures contributed to secondary transmission. Prompt contact tracing, repeated testing, HCP furloughing, and implementation of recommended transmission-based precautions for suspected cases ultimately halted transmission.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alanazi, Khalid H.; Killerby, Marie E.; Biggs, Holly M.; Abedi, Glen R.; Jokhdar, Hani; Alsharef, Ali A.; Mohammed, Mutaz; Abdalla, Osman; Almari, Aref; Bereagesh, Samar; Tawfik, Sameh; Alresheedi, Husain; Alhakeem, Raafat F.; Hakawi, Ahmed; Alfalah, Haitham; Amer, Hala; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Tamin, Azaibi; Trivedi, Suvang; Tong, Suxiang; Lu, Xiaoyan; Queen, Krista; Li, Yan; Sakthivel, Senthilkumar K.; Tao, Ying; Zhang, Jing; Paden, Clinton R.; Al-Abdely, Hail M.; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Gerber, Susan I.; Watson, John T.","journal":"Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c879f96dc666478293b40f9308abb1ab03d87e3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108661.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCP"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["HCP cases","HCP contacts of cases","suspected cases","MERS-CoV cases","following reports of cases","HCP furloughing","outpatient clinic","halted transmission","secondary transmission","subsequent case patients","multiple healthcare facilities","unique index case","dialysis clinic","distinct healthcare-associated outbreaks","available healthcare personnel","Saudi Arabia","implementation of recommended transmission-based precautions","Riyadh","multiple superspreading events","outpatient dialysis unit","hospitals","distinct outbreaks","subsequent implementation of control measures","tertiary-care hospital","specialty pulmonary hospital","Prompt contact tracing","repeated testing","outbreak event","Outbreak investigation","Laboratory results","infection control implications","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","rRT-PCR","seropositivity","family members","recognition","interaction","exposures","Delays","METHODS","genome sequencing","OBJECTIVE","DESIGN","CONCLUSIONS","total","SETTING","Genomic sequences"],"language":"en"},

Aims To evaluate airborne contamination levels within intensive care unit (ICU) isolation rooms over 10\u201324-h periods in order to improve understanding of the variability of environmental aerial bioburden, and the extent to which ward activities may contribute. Methods Environmental air monitoring was conducted within occupied and vacant inpatient isolation rooms. A sieve impactor sampler was used to collect 500-L air samples every 15 min over 10-h (08:00\u201318:00 h) and 24-h (08:00\u201308:00 h) periods. Samples were collected, room activity was logged, and bacterial contamination levels were recorded as colony-forming units (cfu)/m3 air. Findings A high degree of variability in levels of airborne contamination was observed across all scenarios in the studied isolation rooms. Air bioburden increased as room occupancy increased, with air contamination levels highest in rooms occupied for the longest time during the study (10 days) (mean 104.4 cfu/m3, range 12\u2013510 cfu/m3). Counts were lowest in unoccupied rooms (mean 20 cfu/m3) and during the night. Conclusion Peaks in airborne contamination were directly associated with an increase in activity levels. This study provides the first clear evidence of the extent of variability in microbial airborne levels over 24-h periods in ICU isolation rooms, and found direct correlation between microbial load and ward activity.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dougall, L.

There is an urgent need to develop antivirals that can effectively reduce dengue virus (DENV) replication and decrease viral load. Niclosamide, an antiparasitic drug approved for human use, has been recently identified as an effective antiviral agent against a number of pH-dependent viruses, including flaviviruses. Here, we reveal that neutralization of low-pH intracellular compartments by niclosamide affects multiple steps of the DENV infectious cycle. Specifically, niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization not only prevents viral RNA replication but also affects the maturation of DENV particles, rendering them non-infectious. We found that niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization prevented E glycoprotein conformational changes on the virion surface of flaviviruses, resulting in the release of non-infectious immature virus particles with uncleaved pr peptide from host cells. Collectively, our findings support the potential application of niclosamide as an antiviral agent against flavivirus infection and highlight a previously uncharacterized mechanism of action of the drug.","publish_time":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Eunhye; Nam, Sangwoo; Oh, Hyeryeon; Jun, Sangmi; Ro, Hyun-Joo; Kim, Baek; Kim, Meehyein; Go, Yun Young","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61722c462b054f36461375e96e502cbf22648c04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6582152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213630/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45095-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endosomal neutralization","potential application of niclosamide","neutralization of low","viral infections","maturation of DENV particles","viral RNA replication","viral load","dengue virus","effective antiviral agent","DENV infectious cycle","release of non-infectious immature virus particles","number of pH","antiparasitic drug","Dengue fever","pH intracellular compartments","virion surface of flaviviruses","uncleaved pr peptide","multiple steps","E glycoprotein conformational changes","subtropical countries","large parts of tropical","significant public health concern","socioeconomic burden","flavivirus infection","host cells","uncharacterized mechanism of action","important mosquito","antivirals","dependent viruses","human use","findings","urgent need"],"language":"en"},

Conventional treatments against influenza include two classes of pathogen-targeting antivirals: M2 ion channel blockers (such as amantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (such as oseltamivir). Examination of the mechanism of influenza viral infection has shown that endosomal acidification plays a major role in facilitating the fusion between viral and endosomal membranes. This pathway has led to investigations on vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) activity, whose role as a regulating factor on influenza virus replication has been verified in extensive genome-wide screenings. Blocking v-ATPase activity thus presents the opportunity to interfere with influenza viral infection by preventing the pH-dependent membrane fusion between endosomes and virions. This study aims to apply diphyllin, a natural compound shown to be as a novel v-ATPase inhibitor, as a potential antiviral for various influenza virus strains using cell-based assays. The results show that diphyllin alters cellular susceptibility to influenza viruses through the inhibition of endosomal acidification, thus interfering with downstream virus replication, including that of known drug-resistant strains. In addition, combinatorial treatment of the host-targeting diphyllin with pathogen-targeting therapeutics (oseltamivir and amantadine) demonstrates enhanced antiviral effects and cell protection in vitro.","publish_time":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Hui-Wen; Cheng, Jenna Xiao; Liu, Ming-Tsan; King, Kevin; Peng, Ju-Yi; Zhang, Xin-Quan; Wang, Ching-Ho; Shresta, Sujan; Schooley, Robert T.; Liu, Yu-Tsueng","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8da52a3a802395b49a5e06c8cb6fbfd6a32f2d7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b930244e34f91b0f9a987798c5443ec5a8c2f282.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3787953.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3787953?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23820269/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.06.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421300171X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421300171X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","influenza virus replication","influenza pandemic","various influenza virus strains","mechanism of influenza viral infection","diphyllin","v-ATPase activity","vacuolar ATPase","novel v-ATPase inhibitor","downstream virus replication","amantadine","inhibition of endosomal acidification","endosomal membranes","oseltamivir","potential antiviral","cell protection","classes of pathogen","major role","enhanced antiviral effects","cell-based assays","pH-dependent membrane fusion","known drug-resistant strains","antivirals","cellular susceptibility","regulating factor","M2 ion channel blockers","endosomes","serious threat","host","opportunity","humans","virions","therapeutics","extensive genome-wide screenings","combinatorial treatment","addition","animals","results","investigations","neuraminidase inhibitors","Conventional treatments","Examination","natural compound","pathway","study"],"language":"en"},

However, the function and mechanism of ATP1B3 on hepatitis B virus (HBV) propagation is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that ATP1B3 overexpression reduced the quantity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in supernatants of HBV expression plasmids cotransfected HepG2 cells. Correspondingly, small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA mediated ATP1B3 silencing promoted HBsAg and HBeAg expression in the supernatants of HBV expression plasmids transfected HepG2 cells. Mechanically, we reported that ATP1B3 expression could activate nuclear factor\u2010\u03BAB (NF\u2010\u03BAB) pathway by inducing the expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear import of P65 for the first time. And NF\u2010\u03BAB inhibitor (Bay11) impaired the restraint of ATP1B3 on HBV replication. This counteraction effect of Bay11 proved that ATP1B3\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03BAB activation was crucial for HBV restriction. Accordingly, we observed that anti\u2010HBV factors interferon\u2010\u03B1 (IFN\u2010\u03B1) and interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) production were increased in HepG2 cells after the NF\u2010\u03BAB activation. It suggested that ATP1B3 suppressed HBsAg and HBeAg by NF\u2010\u03BAB/IFN\u2010\u03B1 and NF\u2010\u03BAB/IL\u20106 axis. Further experiments proved that ATP1B3 overexpression induced anti\u2010HBV factor BST\u20102 expression by NF\u2010\u03BAB/IFN\u2010\u03B1 axis in HepG2 cells but not HEK293T cells, and ATP1B3 silencing downregulated BST\u20102 messenger RNA level in HepG2 cells. As an HBV restriction factor, BST\u20102 cooperated with ATP1B3 to antagonize HBsAg but not HBeAg in HepG2 cells. Our work identified ATP1B3 as a novel candidate of HBV restrictor with unrevealed mechanism and we highlighted it might serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for HBV infection.","publish_time":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Baisong; Zhang, Jun; Zheng, Tianhang; Wang, Hong; Li, Zhaolong; Huan, Chen; Ning, Shanshan; Wang, Yingchao; Zhang, Wenyan","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/726bd806a5afeb070b6ab8c0d18cd56b15e8a0ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159099.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV","HBV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ATP1B3 expression","ATP1B3 overexpression","mechanism of ATP1B3","restraint of ATP1B3","HBV infection","HBV replication","HBeAg expression","\u03BAB activation","HBV restriction factor","supernatants of HBV expression plasmids cotransfected HepG2 cells","supernatants of HBV expression plasmids transfected HepG2 cells","anti\u2010HBV factor BST","\u03BAB inhibitor","induced NF","HBsAg","HEK293T cells","anti\u2010HBV factors interferon","short hairpin RNA mediated ATP1B3 silencing","novel candidate of HBV restrictor","IFN","\u03B1 axis","nuclear factor","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis B e antigen","quantity of hepatitis B surface antigen","downregulated BST","messenger RNA level","small interfering RNA","unrevealed mechanism","nuclear import of P65","counteraction effect of Bay11","phosphorylation","pathway","numerous viral propagations","HIV","potential therapeutic molecule","work","interleukin","experiments","function","production","regulatory subunits of Na","ATPase","EV71","time","evidence"],"language":"en"},

The origin of these emerging respiratory viruses may be zoonotic (by crossing species barrier, after changes to RNA viruses such as avian influenza virus type A or coronaviruses), or related to the use of new identification techniques (metapneumovirus, bocavirus). The relationship between bronchiolitis and asthma is now better understood thanks to prospective follow up of birth cohorts. The role of rhinovirus has become predominant with respect to respiratory syncytial virus. The identification of predisposing factors immunological, functional, atopic and genetic, for the onset of asthma after rhinovirus infection suggests that viral infection reveals a predisposition rather than itself being a cause of asthma. The role of bacteria in the natural history of asthma is also beginning to be better understood. The results of the COPSAC Danish cohort have shown the frequency of bacterial identification during wheezy episodes before 3 years, and the impact of bacterial colonization at the age of one month on the onset of asthma by age 5 years. The role of bacterial infections in severe asthma in young children is also discussed.","publish_time":"2017-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Blic, J.; Brouard, J.; Vabret, A.; Deschildre, A.","journal":"Rev Mal Respir","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a175bd0d34a3c0d79e4e99613d332f4013ec74fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125672.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262277/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmr.2016.02.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["onset of asthma","severe asthma","cause of asthma","years","emerging respiratory viruses","natural history of asthma","role of rhinovirus","frequency of bacterial identification","spectrum of respiratory viruses","role of bacterial infections","RNA viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","rhinovirus infection","age","impact of bacterial colonization","identification of predisposing factors immunological","use of new identification techniques","viral infection","emerging diseases","avian influenza virus type","metapneumovirus","changes","respect","wheezy episodes","species barrier","young children","COPSAC Danish cohort","coronaviruses","bocavirus","month","results","predisposition","thanks","origin","birth cohorts","relationship","bronchiolitis"],"language":"en"},

A previous study described the development of TAC for the detection of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens; the assay was evaluated against well-characterized analytical materials and a limited collection of human clinical specimens. Objectives We wished to compare TAC assay performance against standard individual RT-qPCR assays for respiratory viral detection, focusing on 10 viruses (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus) from a larger collection of human specimens. Study design We used specimens from 942 children with ARI enrolled systematically in a population-based, ARI surveillance study (New Vaccine Surveillance Network, NVSN). Results Compared with standard individual RT-qPCR assays, the sensitivity of TAC for the targeted viruses ranged from 54% to 95% (54%, 56%, and 75% for adenovirus, human parainfluenza viruses-1 and -2, respectively, and 82%\u201395% for the other viruses).

A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence, which was confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide similarities using the corresponding gene fragments, suggested that isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 emerged from multiple recombination events between parental IBV strains 4/91 and H120. Although the isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 had slightly higher S1 amino acid sequence identity to strain 4/91 (88.2%) than to strain H120 (86%), the serotype of the virus was more closely related to that of the H120 strain (32% antigenic relatedness) than to the 4/91 strain (15% antigenic relatedness). Whereas, vaccination of specific pathogen-free chickens with the 4/91 vaccine provided better protection against challenge with ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 than did vaccination with the H120 strain according to the result of virus re-isolation. As the spike protein, especially in the hypervariable regions of the S1 domain, of IBVs contains viral neutralizing epitopes, the results of this study showed that recombination of the S1 domain resulted in the emergence of a new serotype.","publish_time":"2015-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Tingting; Han, Zongxi; Xu, Qianqian; Wang, Qiuling; Gao, Mengying; Wu, Wei; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cff729d9041680c57e2da890fc7eb52f77c27a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106108.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843651/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134815001197; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134815001197","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H120 strain","LHLJ","S1 gene clustered ck","S1 domain","isolate ck","strain H120-vaccinated chicken flock","terminal sequence","suspected infectious bronchitis virus","phylogenetic analysis","higher S1 amino acid sequence identity","high sequence identity","infectious bronchitis coronavirus","parental IBV strains","SimPlot analysis","hypervariable regions","complete genomic sequence","antigenic relatedness","result of virus re-isolation","corresponding gene fragments","new serotype","multiple recombination events","vaccination of specific pathogen-free chickens","nucleotide similarities","challenge","viral neutralizing epitopes","vaccine","results","IBVs","better protection","study","emergence","infection","spike protein","comparison","B group"],"language":"en"},

However, ESOs remain limited in their effectiveness because of an inadequate delivery profile. Synthetic cationic copolymers of poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are regarded as effective agents for enhanced delivery of nucleic acids in various applications. RESULTS: We examined whether PEG-PEI copolymers can facilitate ESO-mediated dystrophin expression after intramuscular injections into tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mdx mice. We utilized a set of PEG-PEI copolymers containing 2 kDa PEI and either 550 Da or 5 kDa PEG, both of which bind 2\u0027OMe ESOs with high affinity and form stable nanoparticulates with a relatively low surface charge. Three weekly intramuscular injections of 5 \u03BCg of ESO complexed with PEI2K-PEG550 copolymers resulted in about 500 dystrophin-positive fibers and about 12% of normal levels of dystrophin expression at 3 weeks after the initial injection, which is significantly greater than for injections of ESO alone, which are known to be almost completely ineffective. In an effort to enhance biocompatibility and cellular uptake, the PEI2K-PEG550 and PEI2K-PEG5K copolymers were functionalized by covalent conjugation with nanogold (NG) or adsorbtion of colloidal gold (CG), respectively. Surprisingly, using the same injection and dosing regimen, we found no significant difference in dystrophin expression by Western blot between the NG-PEI2K-PEG550, CG-PEI2K-PEG5K, and non-functionalized PEI2K-PEG550 copolymers. Dose-response experiments using the CG-PEI2K-PEG5K copolymer with total ESO ranging from 3\u201360 \u03BCg yielded a maximum of about 15% dystrophin expression. Further improvements in dystrophin expression up to 20% of normal levels were found at 6 weeks after 10 twice-weekly injections of the NG-PEI2K-PEG550 copolymer complexed with 5 \u03BCg of ESO per injection.

The virus replicates extensively and almost exclusively in the epithelial cells of the small intestine resulting in villus atrophy, malabsorption and severe diarrhea. Cellular entry of this enveloped virus is mediated by the large spike (S) glycoprotein, trimers of which mediate virus attachment to the target cell and subsequent membrane fusion. The S protein has a multidomain architecture and has been reported to bind to carbohydrate (sialic acid) and proteinaceous (aminopeptidase N) cell surface molecules. PEDV propagation in vitro requires the presence of trypsin(-like) proteases in the culture medium, which capacitates the fusion function of the S protein. Here we review the current data on PEDV entry into its host cell, including therein our new observations regarding the functional role of the sialic acid binding activity of the S protein in virus infection. Moreover, we summarize the recent progress on the proteolytic activation of PEDV S proteins, and discuss factors that may determine tissue tropism of PEDV in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wentao; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; He, Qigai; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Bosch, Berend-Jan","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc1abf379b4c3809f3a77e17b7e7193e677d7d31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114534.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216302192; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216302192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["East Asia"],"keyphrases":["PEDV entry","virus attachment","PEDV propagation","enveloped virus","virus infection","proteolytic activation of PEDV S proteins","tissue tropism of PEDV","target cell","host cell","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","cell surface molecules","sialic acid binding activity","severe diarrhea","fusion function","Cellular entry","subsequent membrane fusion","functional role","aminopeptidase N","Americas","villus atrophy","devastating outbreaks","small intestine","substantial economic losses","malabsorption","factors","large spike","trimers","glycoprotein","East Asia","new observations","regained notoriety","swine husbandry","culture medium","recent progress","current data","proteases","years","epithelial cells","presence of trypsin","carbohydrate","multidomain architecture","coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

The assay was optimized, and the best results were obtained at 8mM of Mg2\u002B with an incubation time of 40min at 63\u00B0C in the presence of calcein. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 5 viral copies and was 1000-fold more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the developed RT-LAMP assay versus the RT-PCR assay was 100% and 95.7%, respectively. A quantitative RT-LAMP of FHMNV with a high correlation coefficient (r 2 =0.9926) was also developed and the result of quantitation of viral copies in tissue samples of infected fish showed that the viral loads of the infected fish tissue samples reached up to 4.7\u00D71010 copies per mg.

The development of drugs that target dynein activities during viral replication rely on the disruption of characterized and specific interactions between viral proteins and dynein. Because viruses are parasitic in nature, great reason exists to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell protein function and viruses\u2019 dependence on these for additional rounds of infection. Some viral infections induce the assembly of stress granules, including reovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, but others block their assembly during infection. Considering this dependence on dynein activity for assembly, it is possible that viruses co-opt factors of the dynein motor complex during infection, but as a consequence either induce or silence stress granule assembly. This is an emerging field of endeavor, but stress granules and other silencing ribonucleoprotein bodies may represent \u201Cdangerous\u201D areas and structures of the cell that viral replication complexes, proteins, and RNAs/DNAs would need to avoid guaranteeing expression and survival. There is research support for the presence of both dynein and kinesin motors driving viral components toward assembly sites. Several viruses, including poxviruses and the vaccinia virus, replicate in cytoplasmic virus factories. Paradoxically, regulatory genes of various viruses enhance and disrupt microtubule integrity and polarization, but this may directly relate to the timing of the replication cycle. This is an area yet to be explored.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mouland, Andrew J.; Milev, Miroslav P.","journal":"Dyneins","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e9c437acd3efb29eae9a00c8c4fea95d614ce94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150345.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820044100226; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123820044100226","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","viral components","viral infections","assembly of stress granules","viral replication complexes","dynein activities","dynein activity","assembly sites","vaccinia virus","silence stress granule assembly","dynein motor complex","progeny virus particles","respiratory syncytial virus","cytoplasmic virus factories","regulatory genes of various viruses","replication cycle","additional rounds of infection","viruses\u2019 dependence","host cell protein function","kinesin motors","state","reovirus","molecular mechanisms","silencing ribonucleoprotein bodies","end stage","presence","factors","structures","art machineries","specific interactions","entry","chapter","great reason","areas","microtubule integrity","nature","RNAs","consequence","disruption","emerging field of endeavor","development of drugs","Publisher Summary","DNAs","cells","poxviruses","research support","expression","polarization","timing","survival"],"language":"en"},

Bacterial infections are very frequent in children with cystic fibrosis, but because rapid Methods for screening for the wide variety of potentially involved viruses were unavailable until recently, the frequency of viral presence is unknown. Multiplex PCR enables screening for many viruses involved in respiratory infections. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of viruses and bacteria in respiratory specimens from children with cystic fibrosis and to clarify the incidence and characteristics (seasonality and age of patients) of different viruses detected in children with cystic fibrosis. Study design In this 2-year prospective study, we obtained paired nasopharyngeal-swab and sputum specimens from children with cystic fibrosis during clinical respiratory examinations separated by at least 14days. We analyzed viruses in nasopharyngeal-swab specimens with multiplex PCR and bacteria in sputum with standard methods. Results We analyzed 368 paired specimens from 33 children. We detected viruses in 154 (41.8%) and bacteria in 132 (35.9%). Bacteria were commoner in spring and summer; viruses were commoner in autumn and winter. In every season, Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest bacteria and rhinovirus was the commonest virus. Nearly all infections with Haemophilus influenzae occurred in autumn and winter. Viruses were more prevalent in children \u003C5 years old, and bacteria were more prevalent in children \u226512 years old. Conclusions Multiplex PCR screening for respiratory viruses is feasible in children with cystic fibrosis; the clinical implications of screening warrant further study.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mir\u00F3-Ca\u00F1\u00EDs, S\u00EDlvia; Capilla-Rubio, S\u00EDlvia; Marzo-Checa, Laura; Fontanals-Aymerich, Dionisia; Sanfeliu-Sala, Isabel; Espasa-Soley, Mateu; Asensio-de-la-Cruz, Oscar","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e52b14466f05891d49a5ebcdb53b4381f82a0b36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106555.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653216305893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886635/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2016.11.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653216305893","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiplex PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","respiratory viruses","frequency of viruses","involved viruses","different viruses","respiratory specimens","commonest bacteria","Abstract Background Cystic fibrosis","repeated respiratory infections","sputum specimens","paired specimens","Conclusions Multiplex PCR screening","clinical respiratory examinations","nasopharyngeal-swab specimens","Study design","Bacterial infections","paired nasopharyngeal-swab","clinical implications of screening warrant","autumn","year prospective study","years old","winter","rapid Methods","commonest virus","standard methods","frequency of viral presence","degenerative disease","progressive epithelial secretory gland dysfunction","wide variety","summer","age of patients","rhinovirus","incidence","spring","Staphylococcus aureus","characteristics","seasonality","Haemophilus influenzae","days","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Here, we describe a case of emerging calf diarrhoea on a cattle farm in Henan Province, Central China. BNoV was the only enteric pathogen detected in outbreaks according to tests for enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites. The complete genome of the newly identified strain CH-HNSC-2018 was successfully sequenced and found to be 7342 nucleotides in length. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that CH-HNSC-2018 belongs to GIII.2 BNoV. Further analysis of the major capsid protein demonstrated that it is separated by specific genetic distances from previous BNoV strains identified in China and has 4 new amino acid (aa) mutations, 134A, 327 T, 380 L and 423A, in the VP1 protein and 11 aa substitutions in the hypervariable P2 subdomain, suggesting that the BNoV strains circulating in China are diverse.

Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route.

At present it is unknown whether the risk for respiratory disease (BRD) or neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) in the veal herd is associated with total immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or on the serostatus for respiratory pathogens measured at arrival. Therefore, the first objective of this prospective longitudinal cohort study was to determine associations between serum protein fractions as determined by routine electrophoresis (total protein, albumin, alpha-1 and -2 globulins, beta-globulins and Ig\u0027s) at arrival and BRD and NCD in the first 3 weeks of the production cycle. The second objective was to determine whether the serostatus (seropositive/seronegative) of seven respiratory pathogens (bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenzavirus-3, bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Mannheimia haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis) of these arrival serum samples could be associated with the risk of having BRD. The third objective was to determine which of the electrophoresis proteins and respiratory serostatuses were associated with average daily gain (ADG) in the study period. The study population consisted of 150 ros\u00E9 veal calves housed in a single air\u2013space. The study period ended at day 18 post arrival, when BRD incidence was judged to be too high to further postpone a group treatment. A Cox regression model was used to determine the effect of the studied protein fractions and antibodies on the time to BRD and NCD occurrence. The effect of the studied predictors on ADG was determined by linear regression. Calves with Ig levels under 7.5g/L had an increased BRD hazard (hazard ratio (HR)=1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.2\u20133.0)). NCD was only positively associated with the alpha-2 globulin concentration. Calves with a negative serostatus for BCV (HR=1.7 (95% CI=1.0\u20132.8)) or BRSV (HR=2.0 (95% CI=1.0\u20133.9)) had an increased BRD hazard. Average daily gain (ADG) was 0.242kg/day (SD=0.142) and was not related to the occurrence of BRD or NCD. Calves with Ig\u0027s below 7.5g/L and with increased levels of alpha-2 globulins showed a decrease in ADG. This study showed the importance of providing sufficient colostrum to veal calves and the potential benefit of the presence of BCV and BRSV antibodies at arrival to reduce the BRD hazard in the first 3 weeks.","publish_time":"2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pardon, Bart; Alli\u00EBt, Jeroen; Boone, Randy; Roelandt, Sophie; Valgaeren, Bonnie; Deprez, Piet","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30f42526f828c676cf05b215a9bd896f6ccbb925.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114331.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.04.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715001403; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715001403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25937168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRD","NCD","ADG","BCV","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occurrence of BRD","increased BRD hazard","BRD incidence","ADG","ros\u00E9 veal calves","respiratory pathogens","study period","NCD occurrence","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory disease","respiratory serostatuses","post arrival","veal production","study population","HR","objective","arrival serum samples","increased levels of alpha","bovine herpesvirus","bovine coronavirus","veal herd","total protein","BRSV antibodies","hazard ratio","serum protein fractions","studied protein fractions","bovine viral diarrhea virus","presence of BCV","beta-globulins","prospective longitudinal cohort study","average daily gain","effect","risk","negative serostatus","day","Ig\u0027s","Ig levels","weeks","routine electrophoresis","total immunoglobulin","electrophoresis proteins","studied predictors","linear regression","production cycle","neonatal calf diarrhea","Cox regression model","Mannheimia haemolytica","Mycoplasma bovis","common problem","associations","time","potential benefit","parainfluenzavirus","albumin","sufficient colostrum","Abstract Failure of passive transfer","single air","importance","decrease","group treatment","space","present","confidence interval","globulin concentration","SD"],"language":"en"},

Eighteen countries in Europe report weekly influenza activity to EISS (http://www.eiss.org). A questionnaire on the virological data collection was sent electronically to the EISS members. Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patient tests and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently. For the subtyping of influenza, HAI and PCR are used most often. An east-west divide was seen for the use of PCR in typing and subtyping (more PCR use in the west). Differences in the virological surveillance systems in Europe can make direct comparisons difficult because detection rates may differ by test. For the reporting of other respiratory infections besides influenza, many networks (68%) collect information on RSV. This is important because RSV causes similar clinical symptoms as influenza and can have a similar impact in terms of burden of disease. With the collection of RSV data, EISS is moving to a broader spectrum of viral respiratory diseases. The findings of this survey will be used to better harmonise laboratory methods in EISS in order to obtain more reliable and comparable information on influenza activity in Europe.","publish_time":"2004-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meerhoff, T.

Viral epidemics are a socio-economic burden that causes short- and long-term costs for disease diagnosis and treatment as well as a loss in productivity by absenteeism. These outbreaks and their socio-economic costs underline the necessity for a precise analysis of virus-host interactions, which would help to understand disease mechanisms and to develop therapeutic interventions. The combination of quantitative measurements and dynamic mathematical modeling has increased our understanding of the within-host infection dynamics and has led to important insights into viral pathogenesis, transmission, and disease progression. Furthermore, virus-host models helped to identify drug targets, to predict the treatment duration to achieve cure, and to reduce treatment costs. In this article, we review important achievements made by mathematical modeling of viral kinetics on the extracellular, intracellular, and multi-scale level for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, Influenza A Virus, Ebola Virus, Dengue Virus, and Zika Virus. Herein, we focus on basic mathematical models on the population scale (so-called target cell-limited models), detailed models regarding the most important steps in the viral life cycle, and the combination of both. For this purpose, we review how mathematical modeling of viral dynamics helped to understand the virus-host interactions and disease progression or clearance. Additionally, we review different types and effects of therapeutic strategies and how mathematical modeling has been used to predict new treatment regimens.","publish_time":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zitzmann, Carolin; Kaderali, Lars","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1f0b5426cd092d2418eebffd0f2146313ac4e11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6050366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050523/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Dengue Virus","Zika Virus","virus-host models","Ebola virus disease","virus-host interactions","mathematical modeling of viral dynamics","Human Immunodeficiency Virus","Hepatitis C Virus","precise analysis of virus","mathematical modeling of viral kinetics","viral pathogenesis","disease progression","Viral epidemics","treatment costs","dynamic mathematical modeling","basic mathematical models","disease diagnosis","disease mechanisms","Viral infectious diseases","viral life cycle","detailed models","socio-economic costs","treatment duration","host infection dynamics","important steps","important insights","important achievements","long-term costs","new treatment regimens","so-called target cell-limited models","population scale","re-emerging zika","recent outbreaks","socio-economic burden","therapeutic interventions","multi-scale level","effects of therapeutic strategies","combination of quantitative measurements","middle east respiratory syndrome","Influenza","global health concern","transmission","necessity","understanding","drug targets","different types","cure","clearance","chikungunya fevers","loss","productivity","absenteeism","article","purpose"],"language":"en"},

However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support single-peak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories. METHODS: We develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics. RESULTS: The sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.

We found that, after controlling for the city spatial location and the disease arrival time, cities with higher values of both centrality and transitivity were more severely affected by the plague. A simulation study indicates that this association was due to central cities with high transitivity undergo more exogenous re-infections. Our study provides an easy method to identify hotspots in epidemic networks. Focusing our effort in those vulnerable nodes may save time and resources by improving our ability of controlling deadly epidemics.","publish_time":"2017-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez, Jos\u00E9 M.; Verd\u00FA, Miguel","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bede1530aa4f5b0fdc57cd2d582bc7e4f153c1e6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/24708179db3a64c831215a30805bf37e6d27ccf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5338018.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262733/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43467","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["network centrality","high transitivity","transitivity influence vulnerability","vulnerable nodes","network attributes","century plague pandemic","human history","central cities","devastating pandemic","epidemic networks","social networks","deadly epidemics","simulation study","disease arrival time","diseases of human populations","higher values","city spatial location","easy method","exogenous re-infections","pandemics","transportation","hotspots","association","Black Death","resources","large regions","intensity of connections","number","dynamics of transmission","pathogens","effort"],"language":"en"},

A subset of CoVs uses the cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN), a membrane-bound metalloprotease, as a cell entry receptor. In these viruses, the envelope spike glycoprotein (S) mediates the attachment of the virus particles to APN and subsequent cell entry, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe the crystal structures of the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of two closely related CoV strains, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), in complex with their receptor, porcine APN (pAPN), or with a neutralizing antibody. The data provide detailed information on the architecture of the dimeric pAPN ectodomain and its interaction with the CoV S. We show that a protruding receptor-binding edge in the S determines virus-binding specificity for recessed glycan-containing surfaces in the membrane-distal region of the pAPN ectodomain. Comparison of the RBDs of TGEV and PRCV to those of other related CoVs, suggests that the conformation of the S receptor-binding region determines cell entry receptor specificity. Moreover, the receptor-binding edge is a major antigenic determinant in the TGEV envelope S that is targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Our results provide a compelling view on CoV cell entry and immune neutralization, and may aid the design of antivirals or CoV vaccines. APN is also considered a target for cancer therapy and its structure, reported here, could facilitate the development of anti-cancer drugs.","publish_time":"2012-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reguera, Juan; Santiago, C\u00E9sar; Mudgal, Gaurav; Ordo\u00F1o, Desiderio; Enjuanes, Luis; Casasnovas, Jos\u00E9 M.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e8f8ad6957ffac26673761935854e6c05b7768e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3410853.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22876187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["CoV S."],"organizations":["APN","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV cell entry","S receptor-binding region","cell entry receptor specificity","receptor-binding domains","protruding receptor-binding edge","virus-binding specificity","subsequent cell entry","porcine respiratory CoV","TGEV envelope S","CoV vaccines","porcine APN","related CoV strains","RBDs of TGEV","related CoVs","virus particles","cell surface aminopeptidase N","dimeric pAPN ectodomain","respiratory diseases","PRCV","subset of CoVs","neutralizing antibody","antibodies","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","membrane-distal region","severe acute respiratory syndrome","cancer therapy","membrane-bound metalloprotease","enveloped viruses of animals","envelope spike glycoprotein","development of anti-cancer drugs","major antigenic determinant","architecture","surfaces","recessed glycan","compelling view","humans","attachment","immune neutralization","complex","conformation","target","interaction","detailed information","design of antivirals","crystal structures","data","results","coronaviruses","Comparison","common colds"],"language":"en"},

In-host genetic diversity could better position the virus population to respond and adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures such as host-switching events. Multiple new coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples just within the last ten years, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses as emergent human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host-switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus reproduced relatively well in macrophages, but the lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non lab-adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced at average coverages of nearly 950\u00D7(454 sequencing) and 38,000\u00D7(Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passaged samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present but very rare in the unpassaged samples and could quickly shift to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. The insert coded for three arginine residues, occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells, and may allow infection of new cell types via heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were \u201Cselected\u201D from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.","publish_time":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borucki, Monica K.; Allen, Jonathan E.; Chen-Harris, Haiyin; Zemla, Adam; Vanier, Gilda; Mabery, Shalini; Torres, Clinton; Hullinger, Pamela; Slezak, Tom","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7139441855f3ac67f104fb9e067b1359c5582fd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3538757.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23308119/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052752","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Deep"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human samples","insert","simulated host","host cells","bovine nasal samples","virus population","unpassaged samples","single infected host","host genetic diversity","deep sequencing data","bovine coronavirus","lung cell lines","lab-adapted samples","diverse genetic population of viral genotypes","bovine macrophage","mutations present","Multiple new coronaviruses","subsequent population fixation","consensus sequence","infection of new cell types","multiple point mutations","emergent human pathogens","distinct genotypes","novo mutation","coronavirus quasispecies","potential of coronaviruses","passaged strains","different environment","different frequency levels","diverse array of selective pressures","high mutation rate of RNA viruses","spike gene","genomic changes","heparin sulfate binding","region","fusion entry","hypothesis","macrophages","SARS","nucleotide","arginine residues","presence","years","Analysis","pre-existing pool","average coverages","events","genome","Illumina"],"language":"en"},

HAstV assembles from the structural protein VP90 and undergoes a cascade of proteolytic cleavages. Cleavage to VP70 is required for release of immature particles from cells, and subsequent cleavage by trypsin confers infectivity. We used electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image analysis to determine the first experimentally derived, three-dimensional structures of an immature VP70 virion and a fully proteolyzed, infectious virion. Both particles display T =3 icosahedral symmetry and nearly identical solid capsid shells with diameters of ~350\u00C5. Globular spikes emanate from the capsid surface, yielding an overall diameter of ~440\u00C5. While the immature particles display 90 dimeric spikes, the mature capsid only displays 30 spikes, located on the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Loss of the 60 peripentonal spikes likely plays an important role in viral infectivity. In addition, immature HAstV bears a striking resemblance to the structure of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-like particles, as previously predicted from structural similarity of the crystal structure of the astrovirus spike domain with the HEV P-domain [Dong, J., Dong, L., M\u00E9ndez, E. \u0026 Tao, Y.

(1990) Virol. 177, 768\u2013771). The 3\u0027-non-coding segment of 80 nucleotides of the two LDV genomes is identical, whereas marked, but varying nucleotide and amino acid divergence is apparent in the three upstream overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The third ORF from the 3\u0027-end exhibits only 82% nucleotide and 90% amino acid identity, whereas the 3\u0027-terminal ORF, which encodes the nucleocapsid protein, exhibits approximately 99% amino acid identity. The second 3\u0027-terminal ORF encodes an 18.8 kDa protein which lacks N-glycosylation sites but possesses 2 or 3 potential transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half of the molecule. A similar membrane organization is observed for the corresponding protein of equine arteritis virus and the M protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The sequence analyses combined with Northern hybridization analyses of RNA from LDV-infected macrophages and spleens of LDV-infected mice indicate that the three ORFs encoded by the 3\u0027-terminal end of the LDV genome are expressed via the three smallest mRNAs (mRNAs 6\u20138) of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of LDV (mRNAs 2\u20138), which range in size from about 0.8 to 3.6 kb.

The mechanism through which the causative agent, rabies virus (RABV), evades the host immune response and infects the host central nervous system (CNS) has not been completely elucidated thus far. Our previous studies have shown that lab-attenuated, but not wild-type (wt), RABV activates the innate immune response in the mouse and dog models. In this present study, we demonstrate that lab-attenuated RABV causes abortive infection in astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the CNS. Furthermore, we found that lab-attenuated RABV produces more double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) than wt RABV, which is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the common adaptor molecule for RIG-I and MDA5, results in the production of type I interferon (IFN) and the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes, which suppress RABV replication and spread in astrocytes. Notably, lab-attenuated RABV replicates in a manner identical to that of wt RABV in MAVS\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes. It was also found that lab-attenuated, but not wt, RABV induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines via the MAVS- p38/NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway. These inflammatory cytokines increase the blood\u2013brain barrier permeability and thus enable immune cells and antibodies infiltrate the CNS parenchyma, resulting in RABV control and elimination. In contrast, wt RABV restricts dsRNA production and thus evades innate recognition by RIG-I/MDA5 in astrocytes, which could be one of the mechanisms by which wt RABV evades the host immune response in resident CNS cells. Our findings suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in limiting the replication of lab-attenuated RABV in the CNS.","publish_time":"2018-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Bin; Zhou, Ming; Yang, Yu; Yu, Lan; Luo, Zhaochen; Tian, Dayong; Wang, Ke; Cui, Min; Chen, Huanchun; Fu, Zhen F.; Zhao, Ling","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93d7989c46a48482600c23e05c2594c4c7465ba6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5785723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29403485/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.02011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RABV","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wt RABV","RABV replication","RABV control","lab-attenuated RABV replicates","astrocytes","replication of lab","immune cells","host immune response","innate immune response","RIG","resident CNS cells","CNS parenchyma","MDA5","dsRNA production","MAVS- p38","expression of inflammatory cytokines","production of type","abundant glial cells","host central nervous system","expression of hundreds","innate recognition","rabies virus","wild-type","IFN-stimulated genes","melanoma differentiation-associated protein","double-stranded RNA","manner identical","brain barrier permeability","abortive infection","blood","causative agent","mouse","common adaptor molecule","NF-\u03BAB","retinoic acid-inducible gene","interferon","critical role","results","antibodies","contrast","Activation of mitochondrial antiviral","ancient disease","dog models","world","parts","pathway","findings","previous studies","present study","elimination","mechanisms","deaths"],"language":"en"},

For highly diverged sequences, such phylogenetic techniques sometimes estimate surprisingly recent divergence times. In the case of viruses, independent evidence indicates that the estimates of deep divergence times from molecular phylogenetics are sometimes too recent. This discrepancy is caused in part by inadequate models of purifying selection leading to branch-length underestimation. Here we examine the effect on branch-length estimation of using models that incorporate experimental measurements of purifying selection. We find that models informed by experimentally measured site-specific amino-acid preferences estimate longer deep branches on phylogenies of influenza virus hemagglutinin. This lengthening of branches is due to more realistic stationary states of the models, and is mostly independent of the branch-length-extension from modeling site-to-site variation in amino-acid substitution rate. The branch-length extension from experimentally informed site-specific models is similar to that achieved by other approaches that allow the stationary state to vary across sites. However, the improvements from all of these site-specific but time-homogeneous and site-independent models are limited by the fact that a protein\u0027s amino-acid preferences gradually shift as it evolves. Overall, our work underscores the importance of modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences when estimating deep divergence times---but also shows the inherent limitations of approaches that fail to account for how these preferences shift over time.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilton, Sarah K; Bloom, Jesse D","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/302703","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["site-independent models","informed site-specific models","branch-length extension","protein\u0027s amino-acid preferences","importance of modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences","branch-length estimation","branch-length underestimation","recent divergence times","estimates of deep divergence times","inadequate models of purifying selection","deep branches","amino-acid substitution rate","site variation","independent evidence","divergence of modern gene sequences","Molecular phylogenetics","time-homogeneous","experimental measurements of purifying selection","lengthening of branches","diverged sequences","realistic stationary states","inherent limitations of approaches","phylogenetic techniques","phylogenies of influenza virus hemagglutinin","fact","case of viruses","work","effect","sites","discrepancy","improvements"],"language":"en"},

Both ACE and ACE2 are membrane\u2010bound ectoenzymes and may circulate in plasma as a consequence of a proteolytic shedding event. In this study, we show that ACE2 circulates in human plasma, but its activity is suppressed by the presence of an endogenous inhibitor. Partial purification of this inhibitor indicated that the inhibitor is small, hydrophilic and cationic, but not a divalent metal cation. These observations led us to develop a method for removal of the inhibitor, thus allowing detection of plasma ACE2 levels using a sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate\u2010based assay.

There is the need to provide an update for each single medical discipline, including neurosurgery, to be used by single professionals or to be distributed through the neurosurgical community and to be used by governments in designing new scenario of care. Methods A review of the MEDLINE database was performed on April 13th, 2020. Search terms included \u201CCOVID-19\u201D, \u201Cneurosurgery,\u201D and \u201Csurgery\u201D. A review of documents published on the web-page of the WFNS and of the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies AANS, AASNS, CAANS, EANS, and FLANC representing the 119 national Neurosurgical Societies around the world was performed. Results The literature search yielded 38 results that were manually reviewed. Fourteen manuscripts were considered eligible. They described suggestions and considerations to optimize care of neurosurgical patients, editorials on operational models, perspectives from neurosurgical departments, letters to the editor describing experiences on how to help medical staff to be prepared in advance for pandemic situations, description of regional or departmental models and/or organizational schemes. The webpages of the searched societies reported a total of 57 documents. Conclusions The neurosurgical scientific community has promptly reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak by producing a growing number of documents that could serve as guidance for neurosurgeons all over the world. Neurosurgical Societies will represent the key-institutions for guiding the neurosurgical community to overcome the COVID-19 crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"German\u00F2, Antonino; Raffa, Giovanni; Angileri, Filippo Flavio; Cardali, Salvatore Massimiliano; Tomasello, Francesco","journal":"World Neurosurg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d07e81d74780f2e12e82666f5b3fc8f942cc2810.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020308913?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020308913; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.04.181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WFNS","Neurosurgical Societies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurosurgical community","neurosurgical departments","national Neurosurgical Societies","neurosurgical scientific community","COVID","care of neurosurgical patients","continental associations of neurosurgical societies AANS","searched societies","review of documents","neurosurgery","world","literature search","results","single medical discipline","growing number of documents","operational models","departmental models","medical staff","single professionals","Search terms","new scenario of care","perspectives","CAANS","AASNS","editorials","description of regional","advance","letters","FLANC","pandemic situations","WFNS","EANS","experiences","update","governments","humans","considerations","key-institutions","web-page","months","pathogen","Coronavirus-disease","Methods","MEDLINE database","organizational schemes","outbreak","guidance","total","Conclusions","Abstract Background","neurosurgeons","suggestions","webpages","manuscripts","need","crisis","publications"],"language":"en"},

There were 68 penguins that were seropositive for at least one of seven pathogens tested: avian encephalomyelitis virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, Newcastle disease virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae. All samples were seronegative for avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7 and infectious laryngotracheitis virus. The apparent prevalence of Babesia sp. and Borrelia sp. in blood smears was consistent with previous studies. Babesia-infected individuals had a regenerative response of the erythrocytic lineage, an active inflammatory response and hepatic function impairment.

Surface location of fusion protein was verified by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence test. Oral and intranasal inoculations of pregnant sow and mice with recombinant L. casei resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) against recombinant N protein as demonstrated by ELISA.

Lectures and panel discussions centered on international cooperation for better access to vaccines, and partnerships in areas ranging from vaccine research and process development, to clinical studies, regulatory, supply chain and emergency preparedness and response. Global vaccine market trends and changes that will impact vaccine financing and procurement methods were discussed as well as capital sources, including funding, for the development of new or improved vaccines. DCVMN members presented their progress in developing novel Hexavalent, Meningitis, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Shigella, Mumps, Rotavirus, Yellow Fever, Polio, Hepatitis E and Dengue vaccines, and a novel monoclonal antibody cocktail for post-bite prophylaxis against rabies infections. Access to and availability of vaccines is enhanced through sharing of best practices for vaccine quality control, reducing redundant testing and promoting development of harmonized common standards. Eligible stakeholders were encouraged to join the WHO-National Control Laboratory Network for Biologicals which serves as a platform for collaboration and technical exchange in this area. Increasing regulatory convergence at the regional and global levels through mechanisms such as joint dossier review and the WHO Collaborative Registration Procedure can help to accelerate vaccine access globally. Additionally, four proposals for streamlining procedures and alignment of dossiers were discussed. Successful partnerships between a broad range of stakeholders, including international organizations, manufacturers, academic research institutes and regulators have provided support for, and in some cases accelerated, vaccine innovation, clinical trials and registration, WHO prequalification, vaccine introduction and access. Strong partnerships, based on experience and trust, help leverage opportunities and are critically important to advancing the shared goal of providing quality vaccines for all people.","publish_time":"2019-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pagliusi, Sonia; Che, Yanchun; Dong, Shaozhong","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5b8a603f8793693d971cc87de4b7e8f1dd5e211.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6739625.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447125/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19310096; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19310096","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCVMN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine access","vaccine research","vaccine innovation","vaccine financing","vaccine introduction","vaccine quality control","Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine","vaccine manufacturing experts","Global vaccine market trends","quality vaccines","Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network","Dengue vaccines","improved vaccines","availability of vaccines","better access","international organizations","global levels","process development","development of new","Successful partnerships","Strong partnerships","help","global public health organizations","international cooperation","clinical studies","clinical trials","National Control Laboratory Network","regulatory convergence","development of harmonized common standards","DCVMN members","Eligible stakeholders","academic research institutes","Collaborative Registration Procedure","broad range of stakeholders","novel monoclonal antibody cocktail","post-bite prophylaxis","supply chain","Polio","Mumps","Shigella","Meningitis","leaders","Yellow Fever","redundant testing","joint dossier review","mechanisms","Hepatitis E","Rotavirus","prequalification","changes","sharing of best practices","emergency preparedness","Biologicals","progress","regulators","experience","areas","rabies infections","panel discussions","collaboration","technical exchange","platform","response","opportunities","Annual General Meeting","support"],"language":"en"},

Through the national laboratory system, Taiwan CDC effectively detects and characterizes pathogens that cause communicable diseases across the entire country, including both known and novel threats, and also conducts epidemiologic analyses of infectious diseases. In this article, we describe the national laboratory system for public health in Taiwan. We provide additional information on the national influenza laboratory surveillance network to demonstrate how our national laboratory systems work in practice, including descriptions of long-term seasonal influenza characterization and successful experiences identifying novel H7N9 and H6N1 influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Ji-Rong; Teng, Hwa-Jen; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Li, Shu-Ying","journal":"Health Secur","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c96149ec9735f620b4acd1c4da5c537ed2175619.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5404250.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2016.0104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Laboratory System","Global Health Security Agenda","World Health Organization","WHO International Health Regulations","IHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Taiwan\u0027s National Laboratory System","national laboratory systems","nationwide laboratory system able","national influenza laboratory surveillance network","public health","effective laboratory-based diagnostics","Taiwan CDC","International Health Regulations","World Health Organization","Taiwan Centers","Global Health Security Agenda","H6N1 influenza viruses","novel H7N9","charge of infectious disease prevention","novel threats","Disease Control","epidemiologic analyses of infectious diseases","international priority","communicable diseases","entire country","descriptions of long-term seasonal influenza characterization","successful experiences","real-time biosurveillance","practice","action packages","government authority","additional information","intervention","implementation","pathogens","diagnoses","specimens","progress","IHR","mission","article","laboratories","regions"],"language":"en"},

According to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience, anticipation of the pandemic may have impact on behaviors related to influenza vaccination (IV) and relevant public health behaviors such as wearing a face mask when having influenza-like-illnesses (ILI), which would play an important role in the control of human avian influenza outbreaks. This paper investigated the prevalence and factors related to IV uptake and use of face mask in public venues when having ILI symptoms. METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional population-based random telephone survey of 302 Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 18\u201360, using a structured questionnaire, was conducted in November 2005. RESULTS: In the last 3 months, 17.9% of the respondents received IV; 36.6% of those presenting ILI symptoms often used face mask in public venues. Anticipation of a bird-to-human H5N1 outbreak, perceptions that such an outbreak would be worse than SARS, that IV was efficacious in preventing bird-to-human avian influenza transmission were associated with the studied IV behavior (OR=2.64\u20133.97, p \u003C 0.05). Exposure to live birds, perceived similar symptoms between influenza and bird-to-human H5N1 avian influenza, that bird-to-human avian influenza was more lethal than SARS were predictive use of face mask when having ILI symptoms (OR = 4.25\u20138.34, p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IV and use of face mask in the study population may be increasing, which may be related to concerns of avian influenza. Perceptions related to human avian influenza were associated with IV and mask use behaviors. This can potentially be turned into opportunities of promoting desirable public health behaviors.","publish_time":"2008-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, J. T. F.; Kim, J. H.; Tsui, H.

Accumulating evidences have revealed that PRRSV infection fails to induce type I interferon (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2), which are normally induced rapidly during virus replication in virus-infected cells. However, the potential mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection activated the signal transduction components of NF-\u03BAB and AP-1, but not of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), an essential IFN-\u03B2 transcription factor. Furthermore, PRRSV infection significantly blocked synthetic dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03B2 production and IRF3 nuclear translocation. To better understand the upstream signaling events that suppress IRF3 activation, we further investigated the roles of individual components of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)- and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated signaling pathway for IFN-\u03B2 production during PRRSV infection. We observed that PRRSV infection significantly inhibited dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation and IFN-\u03B2 generation by inactivating IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), an adaptor molecule of RIG-I. In contrast, PRRSV infection only partially reduced the activation of TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03B2 (TRIF), an adaptor molecule of TLR3. Our results suggest that PRRSV infection suppresses production of IFN-\u03B2 primarily by interfering with the IPS-1 activation in the RIG-I signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Rui; Xiao, Shaobo; Jiang, Yunbo; Jin, Hui; Wang, Dang; Liu, Manli; Chen, Huanchun; Fang, Liurong","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b977f3e82f1deb2ae82d9e95fb0de0c6b63da9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112510.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2008.01.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18336912/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589008000291; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589008000291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","IFN-\u03B2 generation","production of IFN","IFN-\u03B1","synthetic dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03B2 production","essential IFN-\u03B2 transcription factor","inactivating IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulator","inhibited dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation","adaptor molecule of RIG","adaptor molecule of TLR3","IRF3 nuclear translocation","virus replication","activation of TIR domain","IPS","pathway","respiratory syndrome virus","virus-infected cells","interferon regulatory factor","swine industry","roles of individual components","important swine disease","signal transduction components of NF","retinoic acid-inducible gene","\u03BAB","cause","type","TRIF","contrast","Toll","events","Accumulating evidences","results","potential mechanisms","receptor","study"],"language":"en"},

The present case report describes an 11-month-old male neutered European short hair cat which presented with generalised subcutaneous oedema and pleural and peritoneal effusions. According to clinical examination, abdominal imaging and laboratory analyses, a tentative diagnosis of severe glomerulopathy with massive proteinuria was made. Due to worsening of the clinical signs despite therapeutic interventions and a poor prognosis, the cat was euthanised. Necropsy and histological examinations revealed severe bilateral collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy, generalised oedema and a focal verminous pneumonia with thrombosis in arterial lung vessels containing nematode cross sections. A serum sample was tested for the presence of antibodies against the cat lungworm A. abstrusus, resulting negative. Genetic analyses confirmed the presence of nematode DNA; after exclusion of common lung and heart parasites occurring in cats, DNA of the canid heart worm nematode Angiostrongylus vasorum was identified. This is the first description of a naturally occurring infection with A. vasorum in a cat. Previous experimental studies demonstrated the development of adult male and female A. vasorum worms containing eggs in cats, but no larval excretion in the faeces. Although cats did not become patent, A. vasorum infections were clinically relevant. As A. abstrusus and A. vasorum are both gastropod transmitted nematodes, they may share the same intermediate hosts within overlapping areas. In addition, especially chronic A. abstrusus infected cats become non-patent and do not excrete L1. Considering that patent A. vasorum infections are widespread in the dog and fox population in Switzerland (and several other countries) but are apparently not patent in cats, we cannot exclude that infections with A. vasorum may occur more frequently than expected.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gueldner, Emily Katharina; Schuppisser, Carole; Borel, Nicole; Hilbe, Monika; Schnyder, Manuela","journal":"Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdd13ea60530025779ed7758e83c6b57f4a84c96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104072.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100342; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939019301686; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405939019301686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31796174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vasorum infections","vasorum worms","abstrusus infected cats","cat lungworm","canid heart worm nematode Angiostrongylus vasorum","non-patent","presence of nematode DNA","generalised oedema","heart parasites","metastrongyloid Aelurostrongylus abstrusus","European short hair cat","generalised subcutaneous oedema","nematode cross sections","frequent feline lungworm","severe bilateral collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy","tentative diagnosis of severe glomerulopathy","month-old male","laboratory analyses","feline lungs","Genetic analyses","presence of antibodies","clinical signs","clinical examination","Cardiopulmonary nematodes","arterial lung vessels","exclusion of common lung","development of adult male","gastropod transmitted nematodes","focal verminous pneumonia","thrombosis","different parasite species","histological examinations","dog","therapeutic interventions","abdominal imaging","eggs","peritoneal effusions","poor prognosis","massive proteinuria","Switzerland","fox population","Previous experimental studies","Necropsy","larval excretion","intermediate hosts","overlapping areas","present case report","worsening","addition","faeces","serum sample","L1","countries","description"],"language":"en"},

Lujo virus is only the second pathogenic arenavirus, after Lassa virus, to be recognized in Africa and the first in over 40 years. Because of the remote, resource-poor, and often politically unstable regions where Lassa fever and other viral hemorrhagic fevers typically occur, there have been few opportunities to undertake in-depth study of their clinical manifestations, transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, or response to treatment options typically available in industrialized countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We describe the clinical features of five cases of Lujo hemorrhagic fever and summarize their clinical management, as well as providing additional epidemiologic detail regarding the 2008 outbreak. Illness typically began with the abrupt onset of fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias followed successively by sore throat, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, minor hemorrhage, subconjunctival injection, and neck and facial swelling over the first week of illness. No major hemorrhage was noted. Neurological signs were sometimes seen in the late stages. Shock and multi-organ system failure, often with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, ensued in the second week, with death in four of the five cases. Distinctive treatment components of the one surviving patient included rapid commencement of the antiviral drug ribavirin and administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), N-acetylcysteine, and recombinant factor VIIa. CONCLUSIONS: Lujo virus causes a clinical syndrome remarkably similar to Lassa fever. Considering the high case-fatality and significant logistical impediments to controlled treatment efficacy trials for viral hemorrhagic fever, it is both logical and ethical to explore the use of the various compounds used in the treatment of the surviving case reported here in future outbreaks. Clinical observations should be systematically recorded to facilitate objective evaluation of treatment efficacy. Due to the risk of secondary transmission, viral hemorrhagic fever precautions should be implemented for all cases of Lujo virus infection, with specialized precautions to protect against aerosols when performing enhanced-risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation.","publish_time":"2014-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sewlall, Nivesh H.; Richards, Guy; Duse, Adriano; Swanepoel, Robert; Paweska, Janusz; Blumberg, Lucille; Dinh, Thu Ha; Bausch, Daniel","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c2724f183fa34678d36c94f4798a0697602a9e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4230886.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393244/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003233","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Johannesburg","South Africa","Africa"],"keyphrases":["cases of Lujo hemorrhagic fever","cases of viral hemorrhagic fever","Lassa fever","viral hemorrhagic fever precautions","Lassa virus","cases of Lujo virus infection","viral hemorrhagic fevers","treatment options","abrupt onset of fever","clinical syndrome","clinical manifestations","clinical features","clinical management","Clinical observations","treatment efficacy trials","Distinctive treatment components","objective evaluation of treatment efficacy","surviving case","week of illness","risk of secondary transmission","transmission dynamics","surviving patient","specialized precautions","minor hemorrhage","novel arenavirus","pathogenic arenavirus","nosocomial outbreak","major hemorrhage","South Africa","high case-fatality","enhanced-risk procedures","rash","administration of HMG","gastrointestinal symptoms","significant logistical impediments","pathogenesis","antiviral drug ribavirin","subconjunctival injection","statins","CoA reductase inhibitors","chest pain","rapid commencement","response","N-acetylcysteine","sore throat","evidence","neck","facial swelling","aerosols","malaise","multi-organ system failure","unstable regions","use","Shock","myalgias","industrialized countries","headache","study","Johannesburg","recombinant factor VIIa","endotracheal intubation","resource-poor","future outbreaks","various compounds","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","intravascular coagulopathy","BACKGROUND","death","Neurological signs","late stages","METHODS","opportunities","years"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To describe a pilot surveillance program established in health facilities in Yaound\u00E9, Cameroon in 2017 which aimed to enable detection and reporting of public health events. METHODS: Cameroon\u2019s Ministry of Health, in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cameroon Pasteur Center, and National Public Health Laboratory, implemented event\u2010based surveillance (EBS) in nine Yaound\u00E9 health facilities. Four signals were defined that could indicate possible public health events, and a reporting, triage, and verification system was established among partner organizations. A pre\u2010defined laboratory algorithm was defined, and a series of workshops trained health facilities, laboratory, and public health staff for surveillance implementation. RESULTS: From May 2017 to January 2018, 30 signals were detected, corresponding to 15 unusual respiratory events. All health facilities reported a signal at least once, and more than three\u2010quarters of health facilities reported \u22652 times. Among specimens tested, the pathogens detected included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumocystis jiroveci, influenza A (H1N1) virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. CONCLUSIONS: The events detected in this pilot were caused by routine respiratory bacteria and viruses, and no novel influenza viruses or other emerging respiratory threats were identified. The surveillance system, however, strengthened relationships and communication linkages between health facilities and public health authorities. Astute clinicians can play a critical role in early detection and EBS is one approach that may enable reporting of emerging outbreaks and public health events.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alroy, Karen A.; Gwom, Luc Christian; Ndongo, Chanceline Bilounga; Kenmoe, Sebastien; Monamele, Gwladys; Clara, Alexey; Whitaker, Brett; Manga, Henri; Tayimetha, Carolle Yanique; Tseuko, Dorine; Etogo, Bienvenu; Pasi, Omer; Etoundi, Alain Georges; Seukap, Elise; Njouom, Richard; Balajee, Arunmozhi","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a8d67876f9d695b2ad3251846bb303a9cc46ba1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7040971.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31923349/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12684","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella"],"organizations":["The International Health Regulations","US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cameroon Pasteur Center","National Public Health Laboratory","EBS"],"locations":["Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["reporting of public health events","Yaound\u00E9 health facilities","public health staff","public health authorities","quarters of health facilities","possible public health events","National Public Health Laboratory","Cameroon\u2019s Ministry of Health","immediate reporting of unusual health events","International Health Regulations state","unusual respiratory events","early detection","surveillance system","based surveillance","surveillance implementation","reporting of emerging outbreaks","pilot surveillance program","Haemophilus influenza","early warning","novel influenza viruses","emerging respiratory threats","pre\u2010defined laboratory algorithm","signals","routine respiratory bacteria","Streptococcus pneumoniae","verification system","included Klebsiella pneumoniae","Cameroon Pasteur Center","Moraxella catarrhalis","Staphylococcus aureus","Disease Control","Prevention","Pneumocystis jiroveci","partnership","critical role","relationships","US Centers","communication linkages","pathogens","H1N1","approach","response systems","BACKGROUND","triage","series of workshops","rhinovirus","Astute clinicians","partner organizations","METHODS","adenovirus","specimens","OBJECTIVE","times","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The predicted common structural elements occur in the 3\u2032 end of a segment that is critical for internal ribosome binding, termed \u201Cribosome landing pad\u201D (RLP), of polioviruses. Base pairings between highly conserved 17-nucleotide (nt) and 21-nt sequences in the 5\u2032 UTR of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses constitute a predicted pseudoknot that is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of randomly shuffled sequences. A conserved single-stranded polypyrimidine tract is located between two conserved tertiary elements. R. Nicholson, J. Pelletier, S.-Y. Le, and N. Sonenberg (1991, J. Virol. 65, 5886\u20135894) demonstrated that the point mutations of 3-nt UUU out of an essential 4-nt pyrimidine stretch sequence UUUC abolished translation. Structural analysis of the mutant sequence indicates that small point mutations within the short polypyrimidine sequence would destroy the tertiary interaction in the predicted, highly ordered structure. The proposed common tertiary structure can offer experimentalists a model upon which to extend the interpretations for currently available data. Based on these structural features possible base-pairing models between human enteroviruses and 18 S rRNA and between human rhinoviruses and 18 S rRNA are proposed. The proposed common structure implicates a biological function for these sequences in translational initiation.","publish_time":"1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le, Shu-Yun; Chen, Jih-H.; Sonenberg, Nahum; Maizel, Jacob V.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2c3d23447ffc0764c2105b7e0d874b992e29513.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290261M; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290261M","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

Objective Our objective was to investigate the viral etiological agents responsible for FRI among military recruits training in a tropical climate in Singapore. Study design From March 2006 through April 2007, a total of 1354 oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were collected from military recruits who reported sick with an oral temperature of \u226538\u00B0C and a cough and/or sore throat. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assay for the presence of influenza A and B viruses and adenoviruses (H-AdV), and conventional PCR used for the remaining respiratory viruses in all specimens. Results Influenza A virus was the dominant infection with a laboratory-confirmed incidence of 24% (326/1354) and a predominance of the H3N2 subtype. The temporal pattern for influenza A virus infections coincided with the nation-wide pattern in the civilian community. Detection rates of 12% (159/1354) and 2.7% (5/1354) were obtained for influenza B virus and other respiratory viruses, respectively. Conclusions The laboratory findings identified influenza A virus as the primary causative viral agent for FRI in the Singapore military, in strong contrast to findings from temperate countries and countries where recruits are often vaccinated for influenza. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination should be considered as a requirement to reduce the incidence of influenza infections. This is the first report describing respiratory infections in a tropical military setting, in a developed country in Asia.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seah, Shirley Gek-Kheng; Lim, Elizabeth Ai-Sim; Kok-Yong, Seng; Liaw, Jasper Chin-Wen; Lee, Vernon; Kammerer, Peter; Metzgar, David; Russell, Kevin L.; Tan, Boon-Huan","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6269c2a587166f2d55494df071d77a9047295cb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108280.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209006027; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.12.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079688/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209006027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore","Asia"],"keyphrases":["Results Influenza","influenza B virus","influenza vaccination","presence of influenza","incidence of influenza infections","Singapore military","military environment","virus infections","respiratory infections","military recruits training","tropical military setting","remaining respiratory viruses","B viruses","Abstract Background Military personnel","febrile respiratory illnesses","laboratory findings","Objective","temperate countries","tropical climate","conventional PCR","nation-wide pattern","temporal pattern","sore throat","viral etiological agents responsible","primary causative viral agent","strong contrast","risk factors","H-AdV","adenoviruses","dominant infection","developed country","crowding","stress","Real-time polymerase chain reaction","swabs","oral temperature","cough","civilian community","specimens","requirement","report","Conclusions","predominance","H3N2 subtype","Asia","total","Study design","Detection rates"],"language":"en"},

Infiltration of activated lymphocytes and myeloid cells are thought to be primarily responsible for white matter damage and axonopathy. Over time, this neurologic damage manifests clinically as debilitating motor and cognitive symptoms. Existing MS therapies focus on symptom relief and delay of disease progression through reduction of neuroinflammation. However, long-term strategies to remyelinate, protect, or regenerate axons have remained elusive, posing a challenge to treating progressive forms of MS. Preclinical mouse models and techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and genomic and proteomic analysis have provided advances in our understanding of discrete time-points of pathology following disease induction. More recently, in vivo and in situ two-photon (2P) microscopy has made it possible to visualize continuous real-time cellular behavior and structural changes occurring within the CNS during neuropathology. Research utilizing 2P imaging to study axonopathy in neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease has focused on five areas: (1) axonal morphologic changes, (2) organelle transport and health, (3) relationship to inflammation, (4) neuronal excitotoxicity, and (5) regenerative therapies. 2P imaging may also be used to identify novel therapeutic targets via identification and clarification of dynamic cellular and molecular mechanisms of axonal regeneration and remyelination.

Beyond their direct functions, they also serve as scaffolds to support the association of proteins involved in structural support, adhesion, and transport. Unfortunately, biological processes sometimes malfunction and require therapeutic intervention. For those processes which occur within or upon membranes, it is oftentimes difficult to study the mechanism in a biologically relevant, membranous environment. Therefore, the identification of direct therapeutic targets is challenging. In order to overcome this barrier, engineering strategies offer a new approach to interrogate biological activities at membrane interfaces by analyzing them through the principles of the interfacial sciences. Since membranes are complex biological interfaces, the development of simplified model systems which mimic important properties of membranes can enable fundamental characterization of interaction parameters for such processes. We have selected the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model viral pathogen to demonstrate how model membrane platforms can aid antiviral drug discovery and development. Responsible for generating the genomic diversity that makes treating HCV infection so difficult, viral replication represents an ideal step in the virus life cycle for therapeutic intervention. To target HCV genome replication, the interaction of viral proteins with model membrane platforms has served as a useful strategy for target identification and characterization. In this review article, we demonstrate how engineering approaches have led to the discovery of a new functional activity encoded within the HCV nonstructural 5A protein. Specifically, its N-terminal amphipathic, \u03B1-helix (AH) can rupture lipid vesicles in a size-dependent manner. While this activity has a number of exciting biotechnology and biomedical applications, arguably the most promising one is in antiviral medicine. Based on the similarities between lipid vesicles and the lipid envelopes of virus particles, experimental findings from model membrane platforms led to the prediction that a range of medically important viruses might be susceptible to rupturing treatment with synthetic AH peptide. This hypothesis was tested and validated by molecular virology studies. Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the AH peptide has been identified against HCV, HIV, herpes simplex virus, and dengue virus, and many more deadly pathogens. As a result, the AH peptide is the first in class of broad-spectrum, lipid envelope-rupturing antiviral agents, and has entered the drug pipeline. In summary, engineering strategies break down complex biological systems into simplified biomimetic models that recapitulate the most important parameters. This approach is particularly advantageous for membrane-associated biological processes because model membrane platforms provide more direct characterization of target interactions than is possible with other methods. Consequently, model membrane platforms hold great promise for solving important biomedical problems and speeding up the translation of biological knowledge into clinical applications.","publish_time":"2012-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackman, Joshua A.; Cho, Nam-Joon","journal":"Biointerphases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099340.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13758-011-0018-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22589061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model membrane platforms","biological membranes","biological processes","membrane interfaces","biological activities","complex biological systems","complex biological interfaces","important interfaces","model viral pathogen","development of simplified model systems","important parameters","important properties of membranes","dengue virus","HCV infection","lipid vesicles","translation of biological knowledge","HCV nonstructural","important viruses","Broad-spectrum antiviral activity","lipid envelopes of virus particles","HCV genome replication","important biomedical problems","antiviral drug discovery","synthetic AH peptide","viral replication","cellular systems","engineering strategies","direct characterization of target interactions","antiviral agents","antiviral medicine","direct functions","target identification","therapeutic intervention","virus life cycle","herpes simplex virus","interaction of viral proteins","hepatitis C virus","identification of direct therapeutic targets","fundamental characterization of interaction parameters","biomedical applications","new functional activity","new approach","engineering approaches","association of proteins","essential functions","clinical applications","class of broad-spectrum","cellular protection","structural support","drug pipeline","simplified biomimetic models","experimental findings","great promise","ideal step","useful strategy","\u03B1-helix","treatment","number of exciting biotechnology","prediction","N-terminal amphipathic","adhesion","genomic diversity","barrier","HIV","size-dependent manner","mechanism","transport","principles","scaffolds","range","summary","similarities","membranous environment","review article","deadly pathogens","molecular virology studies","interfacial sciences","methods","order","result","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, throat swabs and blood samples were collected from children (age 1\u201316 years) presenting to the emergency department with febrile pharyngitis. Microbial cause was sought by bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology. Blood MxA level was determined. RESULTS: A potential pathogen was detected in 88% of 83 patients: GAS alone in 10%, GAS and viruses in 13%, group C or G streptococci alone in 2% and together with viruses in 3%, and viruses alone in 59% of cases. Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses. Blood MxA levels were higher in children with viral (880 [245\u20131250] \u03BCg/L; median [IQR]) or concomitant GAS-viral (340 [150\u2013710] \u03BCg/L) than in those with sole GAS (105 [80\u2013160] \u03BCg/L) infections.

We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the generation and dissemination of respiratory aerosols. To investigate the quantity and size of aerosols emitted when the instrument is played, eight healthy volunteers were asked to blow a vuvuzela. For each individual the concentration of particles in expelled air was measured using a six channel laser particle counter and the duration of blowing and velocity of air leaving the vuvuzela were recorded. To allow comparison with other activities undertaken at sports events each individual was also asked to shout and the measurements were repeated while using a paper cone to confine the exhaled air. Triplicate measurements were taken for each individual. The mean peak particle counts were 658\u00D710(3) per litre for the vuvuzela and 3.7\u00D710(3) per litre for shouting, representing a mean log(10) difference of 2.20 (95% CI: 2.03,2.36; p\u003C0.001). The majority (\u003E97%) of particles captured from either the vuvuzela or shouting were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter. Mean peak airflows recorded for the vuvuzela and shouting were 6.1 and 1.8 litres per second respectively. We conclude that plastic blowing horns (vuvuzelas) have the capacity to propel extremely large numbers of aerosols into the atmosphere of a size able to penetrate the lower lung. Some respiratory pathogens are spread via contaminated aerosols emitted by infected persons. Further investigation is required to assess the potential of the vuvuzela to contribute to the transmission of aerosol borne diseases. We recommend, as a precautionary measure, that people with respiratory infections should be advised not to blow their vuvuzela in enclosed spaces and where there is a risk of infecting others.","publish_time":"2011-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Ka-Man; Bottomley, Christian; McNerney, Ruth","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06d734de60efb9ac8c98cd02be9f667d0c535fb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3100331.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21629778/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020086","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIFA"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["size of aerosols","Vuvuzelas","individual","shouting","dissemination of respiratory aerosols","contaminated aerosols","plastic blowing horns","large numbers of aerosols","expelled air","exhaled air","respiratory infections","respiratory pathogens","velocity of air","mean peak particle counts","mean log","sports fans","sports events","size able","concentration of particles","peak airflows","Triplicate measurements","channel laser particle counter","FIFA World Cup soccer tournament","international recognition","duration","South Africa","atmosphere","people","activities","capacity","instrument","generation","precautionary measure","paper cone","lower lung","difference","infected persons","transmission of aerosol","healthy volunteers","enclosed spaces","diseases","comparison","microns","litres","potential","quantity","risk of infecting","diameter","second","investigation","majority"],"language":"en"},

SHFV genomes found in different species of African primates have recently been sequenced but no biological data for these viruses has yet been reported. The sequence of one SHFV isolate from a long term persistently infected baboon showed a high degree of identity to the genome of SHFV-LVR, the prototype strain isolated in the 1960s. Similar to what was observed in early studies with the prototype SHFV isolate LVR, infection of Japanese macaques with 100 PFU of the baboon isolate efficiently induced fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. Consistent with the differential infection outcomes observed in macaques and baboons, SHFV infection of macaque macrophages and dendritic cells is more efficiently than that of baboons and infection induces pro39 inflammatory cytokine production in macaque but not baboon cells. A stable full-length SHFV LVR infectious clone was constructed and basic knowledge about the unique functions of SHFV has been expanded by several recent studies. The SHFV genome encodes extra genes compared to those of other arteriviruses; three instead of two papain-like protease one (PLP1) domains are encoded at the 5\u2019 end and two adjacent sets of four minor structural proteins at the 3\u2019 end. SHFV PLP1\u03B1, PLP1\u03B2 and PLP1\u03B3 were each shown to be active proteases in vitro and the three expected nsp1proteins were detected in infected cells. The catalytic Cys of PLP1\u03B1 is adjacent to an Ala instead of canonical Typ and PLP1\u03B3 is unique among arterivirus PLPs in being able to cleave at both downstream and upstream sites. Although the duplicated sets of SHFV minor structural proteins were predicted to be functionally redundant, data obtained with a set of mutant infectious clones, each with the start codon of one of the minor structural proteins mutated, showed that all eight of the minor structural proteins are required for production of infectious extracellular virus.","publish_time":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brinton, Margo A.; Di, Han; Vatter, Heather A.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73403c1147906598162fcebdea433e6592ca3375.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fc5430a2acb6d149d7f636c4da59d3f199fde8fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4449332.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4449332?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214004997; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214004997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25455336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SHFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome of SHFV","prototype SHFV","SHFV PLP1\u03B1","SHFV genomes","unique functions of SHFV","SHFV infection of macaque macrophages","duplicated sets of SHFV minor structural proteins","stable full-length SHFV LVR infectious clone","infection of Japanese macaques","baboon cells","fatal hemorrhagic fever disease","infected baboon","infected cells","Simian hemorrhagic fever virus","baboons","differential infection outcomes","PLP1\u03B3","adjacent sets","production of infectious extracellular virus","dendritic cells","different species of African primates","multiple species of African nonhuman primates","set of mutant infectious clones","arterivirus PLPs","understudied arterivirus","prototype strain","early studies","biological data","recent studies","catalytic Cys of PLP1\u03B1","pro39 inflammatory cytokine production","natural hosts","persistent infections","NHPs","basic knowledge","high degree of identity","Ala","canonical Typ","expected nsp1proteins","long term","start codon","PFU","extra genes","papain","active proteases","PLP1\u03B2","upstream sites","domains","arteriviruses","sequence"],"language":"en"},

In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing. The purpose of this pictorial review article is to describe the most common manifestations and patterns of lung abnormality on CXR in COVID-19 in order to equip the medical community in its efforts to combat this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Eber, Corey","journal":"Clin Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d127202ed1229abe064833e43344e41881657fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141645.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707120301017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302927/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707120301017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","American College of Radiology","COVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chest CT manifestations of COVID","CT decontamination","COVID testing","CT suites","lack of CT availability","CT room decontamination","CXR utilization","positive CXR","portable chest radiography","American College of Radiology","world","common manifestations","global pandemic of coronavirus disease","lung abnormalities","radiological service availability","early disease detection","patterns of lung abnormality","infection control issues","reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","limited access","RT-PCR","patient transport","inefficiencies","ACR","parts","areas","notes","pivotal roles","vital role","wide variety of specialties","physicians","identification","cases of high clinical suspicion","patients","need","order","date","risk of cross","pictorial review article","purpose","medical community","diagnosis","management","efforts","progresses","literature","Zhou","fact","utilized modality","Chung"],"language":"en"},

However, due to the complex etiology of RTIs, the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these infections remain challenging, especially in developing countries. METHODS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 18 respiratory pathogens, we analyzed 12,502 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient pharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Samples positive for at least 1 pathogen were obtained from 48.42% of the total patients. Of these pathogen-positive patients, 17.99% were infected with more than 1 pathogen. Of the 18 pathogens analyzed, four were detected with a positive detection rate (PDR) \u003E 5%: influenza A virus (IAV) \u003E respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) \u003EMycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) \u003E human coronavirus (HCoV). The pathogens with the 4 highest co-infection rates (CIRs) were as follows: HCoV \u003E human bocavirus (HBoV) \u003E enterovirus (EV) \u003E parainfluenza virus (PIV). The overall positive detection rate (PDR) varied significantly according to patient age, the season and year of detection, and the disease subgroup, but not according to patient sex. The individual PDRs of the pathogens followed 3 types of distributions for patient sex, 4 types of distributions for patient age, 4 types of seasonal distributions, 2 types of seasonal epidemic trends, 4 types of yearly epidemic trends, and different susceptibility distributions in the disease subgroups. Additionally, the overall CIR showed significantly different distributions according to patient sex, patient age, and the disease subgroup, whereas the CIRs of individual pathogens suggested significant preference characteristics. CONCLUSION: IAV remains the most common pathogen among the pathogens analyzed. More effort should be directed toward the prevention and control of pathogens that show a trend of increasing incidence such as HCoV, human adenovirus (ADV), and RSV. Although clinically distinguishing specific pathogens responsible for RTIs is difficult, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the various RTI-causing agents could provide clues for clinicians, thereby informing decisions regarding prevention and medication and guiding appropriate public health strategies.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Xiaohong; Hu, Zhengbo; Liu, Wenkuan; Lu, Yan; Chen, Dehui; Chen, Meixin; Qiu, Shuyan; Zeng, Zhiqi; Tian, Xingui; Cui, Hong; Zhou, Rong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dccf40912c6da39a0326cd025ae83d3933a1849a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4583381.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26406339/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138684","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIR","IAV","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory pathogens","types of distributions","patient age","patient sex","control of pathogens","types of seasonal distributions","CIRs of individual pathogens","pathogen-positive patients","different distributions","clinical characteristics","prevention","HCoV","patient pharyngeal swabs","types of seasonal epidemic trends","distinguishing specific pathogens responsible","overall positive detection rate","different susceptibility distributions","respiratory syncytial virus","Respiratory tract infections","acute respiratory infections","types of yearly epidemic trends","Samples positive","common pathogen","clinical diagnosis","human adenovirus","human bocavirus","human coronavirus","parainfluenza virus","RSV","IAV","year of detection","disease subgroups","total patients","complex etiology of RTIs","significant preference characteristics","individual PDRs","overall CIR","ARIs","medication","PCR","enterovirus","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","polymerase chain reaction","HBoV","various RTI","trend of increasing incidence","treatment","highest co-infection rates","appropriate public health strategies","clues","agents","clinicians","decisions","ADV","BACKGROUND","heavy burden","PIV","developing countries","society","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","METHODS","effort"],"language":"en"},

The expansion of telehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients. However, it is currently unknown whether US hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-ICU). Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population\u2013level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (r=0.948, P\u003C.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (r=\u20130.073, P=.61). CONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population\u2019s interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Young-Rock; Lawrence, John; Williams Jr, Dunc; Mainous III, Arch","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141249.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250963/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center","American Hospital Association Annual Survey"],"locations":["United States","Northeast","West","Midwest"],"keyphrases":["telehealth system","proportion of hospitals","US hospitals","level of population","current telehealth capacity","expansion of telehealth services","higher population-level","cases","proxy of population","US states","increased population demand","number of COVID","United States","population-level internet search volume","health care facilities","health care providers","relations of population search volume","nation\u2019s health care capacity","number of new COVID","ongoing health care needs of patients","timely care","capability of telemedicine intensive care unit","health conditions","tele-ICU capability","cumulative numbers of COVID","US population\u2019s","internet search volume data","tele-ICU capabilities","increasing demand","initial screening of symptomatic patients","significant association","Midwest region","strong correlation","Pearson correlation","West census region","novel coronavirus disease","American Hospital Association Annual Survey","Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center","Google Trends","exposure","composite score","overloading","Northeast","study period","concern","impending patient surge","electronic visits","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Telecommunication infrastructures","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","practical investment","pandemic","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. Here, a comprehensive updated assessment of aviation is provided. Scientific advances since the 1999 assessment have reduced key uncertainties, sharpening the quantitative evaluation, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The climate impact of aviation is driven by long-term impacts from CO2 emissions and shorter-term impacts from non-CO2 emissions and effects, which include the emissions of water vapour, particles and nitrogen oxides (NO x ). The present-day radiative forcing from aviation (2005) is estimated to be 55 mW m\u22122 (excluding cirrus cloud enhancement), which represents some 3.5% (range 1.3\u201310%, 90% likelihood range) of current anthropogenic forcing, or 78 mW m\u22122 including cirrus cloud enhancement, representing 4.9% of current forcing (range 2\u201314%, 90% likelihood range). According to two SRES-compatible scenarios, future forcings may increase by factors of 3\u20134 over 2000 levels, in 2050. The effects of aviation emissions of CO2 on global mean surface temperature last for many hundreds of years (in common with other sources), whilst its non-CO2 effects on temperature last for decades. Much progress has been made in the last ten years on characterizing emissions, although major uncertainties remain over the nature of particles. Emissions of NO x result in production of ozone, a climate warming gas, and the reduction of ambient methane (a cooling effect) although the overall balance is warming, based upon current understanding. These NO x emissions from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite the progress made on modelling aviation\u0027s impacts on tropospheric chemistry, there remains a significant spread in model results. The knowledge of aviation\u0027s impacts on cloudiness has also improved: a limited number of studies have demonstrated an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the magnitude varies: however, these trend analyses may be impacted by satellite artefacts. The effect of aviation particles on clouds (with and without contrails) may give rise to either a positive forcing or a negative forcing: the modelling and the underlying processes are highly uncertain, although the overall effect of contrails and enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could be substantial, compared with other effects. The debate over quantification of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs. Current studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to determine optimal technological development paths, which is an aspect that atmospheric science has much to contribute. In terms of alternative fuels, liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some of aviation\u0027s impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon-neutral way: such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a \u2018hydrogen economy\u2019 develops. The introduction of biofuels as a means of reducing CO2 impacts represents a future possibility. However, even over and above land-use concerns and greenhouse gas budget issues, aviation fuels require strict adherence to safety standards and thus require extra processing compared with biofuels destined for other sectors, where the uptake of such fuel may be more beneficial in the first instance.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, D.

What is frequently overlooked is the fact that, in light of a wealth of evidence as well as other management options, a therapy deemed suitable yesterday may no longer be the first choice today. Use of blood has not been based upon scientific evaluation of benefits, but mostly on anecdotal experience and a variety of factors are challenging current practice. Blood is a precious resource with an ever limiting supply due to the aging population. Costs have also continually increased due to advances (and complexities) in collection, testing, processing and administration of transfusion, which could make up 5% of the total health service budget. Risks of transfusions remain a major concern, with advances in blood screening and processing shifting the profile from infectious to non\u2010infectious risks. Most worrying though, is the accumulating literature demonstrating a strong (often dose\u2010dependent) association between transfusion and adverse outcomes. These include increased length of stay, postoperative infection, morbidity and mortality. To this end, a recent international consensus conference on transfusion outcomes (ICCTO) concluded that there was little evidence to corroborate that blood would improve patients\u2019 outcomes in the vast majority of clinical scenarios in which transfusions are currently routinely considered; more appropriate clinical management options should be adopted and transfusion avoided wherever possible. On the other hand, there are patients for whom the perceived benefits of transfusion are likely to outweigh the potential risks. Consensus guidelines for blood component therapy have been developed to assist clinicians in identifying these patients and most of these guidelines have long advocated more conservative \u2018triggers\u2019 for transfusion. However, significant variation in practice and inappropriate transfusions are still prevalent. The \u2018blood must always be good philosophy\u2019 continues to permeate clinical practice. An alternative approach, however, is being adopted in an increasing number of centres. Experience in managing Jehovah\u2019s Witness patients has shown that complex care without transfusion is possible and results are comparable with, if not better than those of transfused patients. These experiences and rising awareness of downsides of transfusion helped create what has become known as \u2018patient blood management\u2019. Principles of this approach include optimizing erythropoiesis, reducing surgical blood loss and harnessing the patient\u2019s physiological tolerance of anaemia. Treatment is tailored to the individual patient, using a multidisciplinary team approach and employing a combination of modalities. Results have demonstrated reduction of transfusion, improved patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. Significant healthcare cost savings have also followed. Despite the success of patient blood management programmes and calls for practice change, the potential and actual harm to patients caused through inappropriate transfusion is still not sufficiently tangible for the public and many clinicians. This has to change. The medical, ethical, legal and economic evidence cannot be ignored. Patient blood management needs to be implemented as the standard of care for all patients.","publish_time":"2009-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomson, A.; Farmer, S.; Hofmann, A.; Isbister, J.; Shander, A.","journal":"ISBT Sci Ser","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9e780a8de41b51d4f27c29e4401038417dc9cdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169263.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328164/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-2824.2009.01251.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood transfusions","transfusion outcomes","blood screening","Patient blood management needs","reduction of transfusion","administration of transfusion","success of patient blood management programmes","blood component therapy","perceived benefits of transfusion","surgical blood loss","improved patient outcomes","individual patient","patient satisfaction","clinical practice","transfused patients","Risks of transfusions","practice change","inappropriate transfusions","appropriate clinical management options","Jehovah\u2019s Witness patients","adverse outcomes","patients\u2019 outcomes","current practice","potential risks","processing","Consensus guidelines","advances","economic evidence","little evidence","results","alternative approach","non\u2010infectious risks","wealth of evidence","clinicians","multidisciplinary team approach","complex care","vast majority of clinical scenarios","anecdotal experience","significant variation","standard of care","increased length of stay","scientific evaluation of benefits","recent international consensus conference","Significant healthcare cost savings","postoperative infection","optimizing erythropoiesis","profile","actual harm","major concern","collection","variety of factors","testing","ICCTO","patient\u2019s physiological tolerance of anaemia","supply","morbidity","end","rising awareness of downsides","association","suitable yesterday","good philosophy","total health service budget","experiences","mortality","complexities","light","combination of modalities","Principles","history","precious resource","increasing number of centres","accumulating literature","lives","aging population","Treatment","triggers\u2019","hand","choice","Costs"],"language":"en"},

Here, we cloned the duck KPNA4 (duKPNA4) gene and analyzed its involvement in type I IFN expression as well as antiviral response against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The full-length duKPNA4 gene encoded a 520-amino acid protein that shared 97.3\u201398.7% sequence similarity with its orthologues in chickens, humans and mice. The duKPNA4 was extensively expressed in various duck tissues at the mRNA level. Analysis of the subcellular localization of duKPNA4 by immunofluorescence assays indicated that the duKPNA4 was primarily distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in primary duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEFs). However, it translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to poly(I:C) stimulation or JEV infection. The duKPNA4 interacted with duck IFN regulatory factor 7 and facilitated its nuclear translocation, thereby up-regulating the expression of IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2 in DEFs in the presence of poly(I:C) stimulation.

In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to unravel changes in the MERS CoV heptad repeat domains (HRs) and factors affecting fusion state HR stability. Results indicated that HR trimer is more rapidly stabilized, having stable system energy and lower root mean square deviations (RMSDs). While trimers were the predominant active form of CoVs HRs, monomers were also discovered in both of viral and cellular membranes. In order to find the differences between S2 monomer and trimer molecular dynamics, S2 monomer was modelled and subjected to MD simulation. In contrast to S2 trimer, S2 monomer was unstable, having high RMSDs with major drifts above 8 \u00C5. Fluctuation of HR residue positions revealed major changes in the C-terminal of HR2 and the linker coil between HR1 and HR2 in both monomer and trimer. Hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions of HR helices stabilize the whole system, with minimal changes in RMSD. The global distance test and contact area difference scores support instability of MERS CoV S2 monomer. Analysis of HR1-HR2 inter-residue contacts and interaction energy revealed three energy scales along HR helices. Two strong interaction energies were identified at the start of the HR2 helix and at the C-terminal of HR2. The identified critical residues by MD simulation and residues at the a and d positions of HR helix were strong stabilizers of HR recognition.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kandeel, Mahmoud; Al-Taher, Abdulla; Li, Huifang; Schwingenschlogl, Udo; Al-Nazawi, Mohamed","journal":"Computational Biology and Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83f943c15b738684761318470420fd04157a11d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106505.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803965/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1476927118300926; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927118300926; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2018.05.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["HR trimer","S2 trimer","d positions of HR helix","HR2 helix","d positions of HR helices","Fluctuation of HR residue positions","strong stabilizers of HR recognition","trimer molecular dynamics","interaction energy","major changes","fusion state HR stability","MD simulation","MERS CoV heptad","HR2 inter-residue contacts","contact area difference scores support instability of MERS CoV S2 monomer","energy scales","stable system energy","C-terminal","minimal changes","Hydrophobic residues","identified critical residues","strong interaction energies","major drifts","high RMSDs","Analysis of HR1","predominant active form of CoVs HRs","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","lower root","global distance test","factors","square deviations","infection process","Abstract Structural studies","domains","linker coil","differences","monomers","start","simulations","contrast","trimers","study","cellular membranes","order","Results"],"language":"en"},

Thus, it is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China. Therefore, the investigation of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning signs, which in turn minimizes the impact of such future outbreaks in China.

We recently introduced Cavbase, a method for describing and comparing protein binding pockets on the basis of the geometrical and physicochemical properties of their active sites. Here, we present algorithmic and methodological enhancements in the Cavbase property description and in the cavity comparison step. We give examples of the Cavbase similarity analysis detecting pronounced similarities in the binding sites of proteins unrelated in sequence. A similarity search using SARS Mpro protease subpockets as queries retrieved ligands and ligand fragments accommodated in a physicochemical environment similar to that of the query. This allowed the characterization of the protease recognition pockets and the identification of molecular building blocks that can be incorporated into novel antiviral compounds. A cluster analysis procedure for the functional classification of binding pockets was implemented and calibrated using a diverse set of enzyme binding sites. Two relevant protein families, the \u03B1-carbonic anhydrases and the protein kinases, are used to demonstrate the scope of our cluster approach. We propose a relevant classification of both protein families, on the basis of the binding motifs in their active sites. The classification provides a new perspective on functional properties across a protein family and is able to highlight features important for potency and selectivity. Furthermore, this information can be used to identify possible cross-reactivities among proteins due to similarities in their binding sites.","publish_time":"2006-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuhn, Daniel; Weskamp, Nils; Schmitt, Stefan; H\u00FCllermeier, Eyke; Klebe, Gerhard","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79246e2ed646afb4c999dd767475991807ac4a32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094329.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606004724; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606004724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classification of protein binding sites","protein binding pockets","functional classification of binding pockets","binding motifs","binding sites of proteins unrelated","active sites","protein family","protein kinases","relevant protein families","diverse set of enzyme binding sites","physicochemical properties","relevant classification","functional properties","Cavbase similarity analysis","protease recognition pockets","basis","Cavbase property description","physicochemical environment similar","cluster analysis procedure","pronounced similarities","similarity search","cluster approach","SARS Mpro protease subpockets","queries","ligands","ligand fragments","\u03B1-carbonic anhydrases","methodological enhancements","identification of molecular building blocks","new perspective","cavity comparison step","sequence","possible cross-reactivities","potency","characterization","examples","contribution","novel antiviral compounds","selectivity","query","scope","information"],"language":"en"},

This vector contains an MHV intergenic sequence to promote the expression of foreign genes. In this study, we used this vector to introduce a hemagglutininesterase (HE) protein, an optional MHV structural protein, into the MHV-infected cells. The engineered HE protein could be efficiently incorporated into the virion which did not synthesize its own HE protein, thus generating a pseudorecombinant virus that expresses an exogenous HE protein. The engineered HE protein could be made distinguishable from the native protein by attaching an 8-amino-acid peptide tag at the carboxyl-terminus. Both the engineered and native HE proteins from the HE-producing virus train could be incorporated into the virion, thus generating phenotypically mixed virus parficles. We also showed that the HE-expressing DI RNA could be incorporated into viruses, and the engineered HE protein expressed in the infected cells for at least three serial virus passages. Furthermore, we have made two mutants, in which parts of the external domain of the HE protein have been deleted, to study the sequence requirements for the stable expression of HE and its incorporation into MHV virions. Although both of the mutant HE proteins could be expressed in the MHV-infected cells, they failed to be incorporated into virions, suggesting the importance of the extracellular domain of HE protein for its incorporation into virus particles. This vector system enabled the first successful incorporation of a selected coronaviral protein into virions and demonstrates its utility as an expression vector for studying the molecular biology of coronaviruses.","publish_time":"1995-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Ching-Len; Zhang, Xuming; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285711555; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285711555","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["native protein","optional MHV structural protein","MHV-infected cells","MHV virions","selected coronaviral protein","expression vector system","pseudorecombinant virus","virus particles","virus train","MHV intergenic sequence","serial virus passages","mixed virus parficles","RNA of mouse hepatitis virus","stable expression","expression of foreign genes","successful incorporation","DI","proteins","study","sequence requirements","external domain","extracellular domain","defective-interfering","amino-acid peptide tag","utility","carboxyl-terminus","molecular biology of coronaviruses","parts","importance","prototype coronavirus","hemagglutininesterase","mutants"],"language":"en"},

Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. METHODS: Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0\u20132.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1\u20130.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15\u201344 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Degnah, Afnan A.; Al-amri, Sawsan S.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Almasoud, Abdulrahman S.; Mousa, Manar; Almahboub, Sarah A.; Alhabbab, Rowa Y.; Mirza, Ahmed A.; Hindawi, Salwa I.; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Azhar, Esam I.; Hashem, Anwar M.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee07c218da184cdc5e3bab69c1de575966764250.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9d8156ce40964d8f4633ff44679acbd275f66370.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104088.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120300010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120300010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32005618/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","India","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["different nationalities","MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation","Samples","western Saudi Arabia","MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies","Confirmed seropositivity","potential MERS exportation","increasing trend of MERS","Seropositivity of individuals","primary human infections","possible source of infection","unrecognized source of infection","Archived human sera","sporadic community cases","mild infections","ELISA positive","live virus neutralization assays","neutralizing Abs","subclinical cases","recognized zoonotic coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Sudan","role of dromedaries","Egypt","Yemen","general population","Palestine","Pakistan","act","women","healthy adult blood donors","India","BACKGROUND","years","Arabian Peninsula","significant preference","Current evidence","METHODS","testing","CONCLUSIONS","continuous surveillance","RESULTS","Presence"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To report the association with Ran Binding Protein (RANBP2) gene variant and the response to decompressive craniectomy and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) in life-threatening AHEM. DESIGN: Single case study. CASE REPORT: A 6-year-old girl known to have sickle cell disease (SCD) presented an acquired demyelinating syndrome (ADS) with diplopia due to sudden unilateral fourth nerve palsy. She received five pulses of IVMP (30 mg/kg/day). Two weeks after steroid weaning, she developed right hemiplegia and coma. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a left frontal necrotico-hemorrhagic lesion and new multifocal areas of demyelination. She underwent decompressive craniotomy and evacuation of an ongoing left frontoparietal hemorrhage. Comprehensive investigations ruled out vascular and infectious process. The neurological deterioration stopped concomitantly with combined neurosurgical drainage of the hematoma, decompressive craniotomy, IVMP, and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). She developed during the following months Crohn disease and sclerosing cholangitis. After 2-year follow-up, there was no new neurological manifestation. The patient still suffered right hemiplegia and aphasia, but was able to walk. Cognitive/behavioral abilities significantly recovered. A heterozygous novel rare missense variant (c.4993A\u003EG, p.Lys1665Glu) was identified in RANBP2, a gene associated with acute necrotizing encephalopathy. RANBP2 is a protein playing an important role in the energy homeostasis of neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: In any ADS occurring in the context of SCD and/or autoimmune condition, we recommend to slowly wean steroids and to closely monitor the patient after weaning to quickly treat any recurrence of neurological symptom with IVMP. This case report, in addition to others, stresses the likely efficacy of combined craniotomy, IVIG, and IVMP treatments in AHEM. RANBP2 mutations may sensitize the brain to inflammation and predispose to AHEM.","publish_time":"2018-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alawadhi, Abdulla; Saint-Martin, Christine; Bhanji, Farhan; Srour, Myriam; Atkinson, Jeffrey; S\u00E9bire, Guillaume","journal":"Front Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef6638accc1ef599ad1aafd47b3a86f2b904cc76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5857578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.00130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593631/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ran Binding Protein","IVMP","Comprehensive"],"locations":["Crohn"],"keyphrases":["decompressive craniotomy","IVMP treatments","pulses of IVMP","CASE REPORT","Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis","RANBP2 mutations","decompressive craniectomy","gene variant","hemorrhagic necrosis","IVIG","acute necrotizing encephalopathy","ADS","right hemiplegia","new neurological manifestation","neurological deterioration","patient","rare form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","likely efficacy of combined craniotomy","recurrence of neurological symptom","Single case study","left frontal necrotico-hemorrhagic lesion","intravenous immunoglobulins","fulminant encephalopathy","context of SCD","steroid weaning","heterozygous novel rare missense variant","combined neurosurgical drainage","sickle cell disease","Ran Binding Protein","high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone","ongoing left frontoparietal hemorrhage","new multifocal areas of demyelination","following months Crohn disease","Brain magnetic resonance imaging","diplopia","evacuation","response","hematoma","sclerosing cholangitis","important role","acquired demyelinating syndrome","year-old girl","association","energy homeostasis of neuronal cells","aphasia","Comprehensive investigations","infectious process","nerve palsy","DESIGN","fatal outcome","Lys1665Glu","addition","BACKGROUND","autoimmune condition","year follow-up","behavioral abilities","weeks","inflammation","coma","OBJECTIVE","steroids","CONCLUSION","day"],"language":"en"},

VEEV is highly infectious in aerosol form and has been weaponized in the past making it a potential biothreat agent. At present, there are no FDA approved antiviral treatments or vaccines for VEEV. Artificial microRNAs are small molecules which are expressed through endogenous microRNA machinery by RNA polymerase II. These artificial microRNAs effectively inhibit gene expression and are non-toxic to the host cell. VEEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is central to VEEV replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted inhibition of VEEV RdRp using artificial microRNAs may efficiently inhibit VEEV replication. Five artificial microRNAs were tested in vitro in BHK cells. Three of these artificial miRNAs showed significant inhibition of VEEV replication. Further, these microRNAs were cloned into the expression vector in combination to see the synergistic effect on VEEV replication. Combination of more than one miRNA did not result in significant inhibition of virus replication. In conclusion, we have shown that RNAi through artificial microRNAs effectively inhibits VEEV replication and is significantly less toxic in comparison to siRNAs.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhomia, Manish; Sharma, Anuj; Gayen, Manoshi; Gupta, Paridhi; Maheshwari, Radha K.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3ac316e4528ab9a0050e0b755d47bdc997f488d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113778.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354213002180; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.08.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354213002180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23988697/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEEV","FDA","BHK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Artificial microRNAs","significant inhibition of VEEV replication","targeted inhibition of VEEV RdRp","VEEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase","artificial miRNAs","significant inhibition of virus replication","combination","expression vector","gene expression","Abstract Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","member","endogenous microRNA machinery","alphavirus family","small molecules","synergistic effect","past","FDA","aerosol form","antiviral treatments","vaccines","RNAi","genus togaviridae","potential biothreat agent","host cell","BHK cells","comparison","siRNAs","present","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The CORE Problem List Subset was created to facilitate the terminology\u2019s implementation. This study evaluates the CORE Subset\u2019s coverage and examines its growth pattern as source datasets are being incorporated. Methods Coverage of frequently used terms and the corresponding usage of the covered terms were assessed by \u201Cleave-one-out\u201D analysis of the eight datasets constituting the current CORE Subset. The growth pattern was studied using a retrospective experiment, growing the Subset one dataset at a time and examining the relationship between the size of the starting subset and the coverage of frequently used terms in the incoming dataset. Linear regression was used to model that relationship. Results On average, the CORE Subset covered 80.3% of the frequently used terms of the left-out dataset, and the covered terms accounted for 83.7% of term usage. There was a significant positive correlation between the CORE Subset\u2019s size and the coverage of the frequently used terms in an incoming dataset. This implies that the CORE Subset will grow at a progressively slower pace as it gets bigger. Conclusion The CORE Problem List Subset is a useful resource for the implementation of Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms in electronic health records. It offers good coverage of frequently used terms, which account for a high proportion of term usage. If future datasets are incorporated into the CORE Subset, it is likely that its size will remain small and manageable.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fung, Kin Wah; Xu, Julia","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bef5b16827f5a3af4860ca00c907970107efe4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5566198.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocu022; https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-pdf/22/3/649/5243108/ocu022.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25725003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CORE Problem List Subset","CORE Subset","Medicine Clinical Terms"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["used terms","covered terms","current CORE Subset","CORE Subset\u2019s coverage","CORE Problem List Subset","starting subset","CORE Subset\u2019s size","implementation of Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms","Objective Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms","Methods Coverage","good coverage","incoming dataset","electronic health records","clinical information","growth pattern","corresponding usage","source datasets","future datasets","relationship","high proportion of term usage","terminology\u2019s implementation","emergent international health terminology standard","SNOMED CT","useful resource","account","significant positive correlation","retrospective experiment","Conclusion","Results","average","time","study","left","slower pace","Linear regression","analysis"],"language":"en"},

From a metabolic point of view, adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an essential protein in the regulation of the total intracellular and extracellular adenosine in a tissue. In addition to its cytosolic localization, ADA is also expressed as an ecto-enzyme on the surface of different cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26) and some ARs act as binding proteins for extracellular ADA in humans. Since CD26 and ARs interact with ADA at opposite sites, we have investigated if ADA can function as a cell-to-cell communication molecule by bridging the anchoring molecules CD26 and A(2A)R present on the surfaces of the interacting cells. By combining site-directed mutagenesis of ADA amino acids involved in binding to A(2A)R and a modification of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique that allows detection of interactions between two proteins expressed in different cell populations with low steric hindrance (NanoBRET), we show direct evidence of the specific formation of trimeric complexes CD26-ADA-A(2A)R involving two cells. By dynamic mass redistribution assays and ligand binding experiments, we also demonstrate that A(2A)R-NanoLuc fusion proteins are functional. The existence of this ternary complex is in good agreement with the hypothesis that ADA could bridge T-cells (expressing CD26) and dendritic cells (expressing A(2A)R). This is a new metabolic function for ecto-ADA that, being a single chain protein, it has been considered as an example of moonlighting protein, because it performs more than one functional role (as a catalyst, a costimulator, an allosteric modulator and a cell-to-cell connector) without partitioning these functions in different subunits.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno, Estefan\u00EDa; Canet, J\u00FAlia; Gracia, Eduard; Llu\u00EDs, Carme; Mallol, Josefa; Canela, Enric I.; Cort\u00E9s, Antoni; Casad\u00F3, Vicent","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/474a502696d79b407fb2ff9f85d1b974d0064bf6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5818423.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.00106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29497379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dipeptidyl"],"organizations":["ADA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extracellular ADA","ecto-ADA","binding proteins","specific formation of trimeric complexes CD26-ADA","extracellular adenosine","different cell populations","mutagenesis of ADA amino acids","cell connector","surface of different cells","T-cells","interacting cells","dendritic cells","R present","adenosine deaminase","adenosine receptor","R-NanoLuc fusion proteins","cell communication molecule","anchoring molecules CD26","different subunits","essential protein","ligand binding experiments","new metabolic function","single chain protein","example of moonlighting protein","ARs act","ecto-enzyme","functional role","metabolic point of view","technique","NanoBRET","bioluminescence resonance energy transfer","low steric hindrance","dynamic mass redistribution assays","living systems","homeostatic network regulator","pathways","modification","good agreement","regulation","direct evidence","ternary complex","catalyst","endogenous purine nucleoside","detection of interactions","hypothesis","functions","surfaces","humans","allosteric modulator","opposite sites","Dipeptidyl peptidase IV","costimulator","addition","cytosolic localization","tissue","existence"],"language":"en"},

The enormous genetic diversity of IBV poses difficulty in diagnosing and controlling the virus. To understand the nature of IBV prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas, we characterized two field strains, isolated from non-immunized broiler chickens, by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein. The analysis revealed both the isolates are identical to each other, with nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of 99.4% and 98.4%, respectively. They exhibit variable sequence divergence in the S1 gene to that of the reference serotypes. Both are of \u201CMassachusetts type\u201D belonging to GI-1 lineage of the IBV g\u00E9notype. The phylogenetic analysis revealed both of the isolates clustered into the same branch as that of many IBV strains recently reported from China and Iran.

Several MMTV strains have been shown to productively infect, in addition to murine cells, various heterologous cell lines including those of human origin, albeit less efficiently than murine cells. Furthermore, there have been reports that the continued passage of MMTV in heterologous cell lines gives rise to novel variants that are able to infect naive non-murine cells with higher efficiency than the parental virus. RESULTS: We show that MMTV(C3H), like other MMTV strains, that had undergone a number of replication cycles in non-murine cells displayed an increased replication kinetic, as compared to parental virus, when applied on naive human cells. Sequence analysis of several replication kinetic variants and the parental virus, together with calculation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations at individual codons, revealed that several regions within the viral genome were under strong positive selection pressure during viral replication in human cells. The mutation responsible, at least in part, for the phenotypic change was subsequently mapped to the segment of env encoding the receptor binding site (F(40)HGFR(44)). Introduction of the identified mutation, leading to single amino acid substitution (G42E), into egfp-containing recombinant MMTV virions enhanced their ability to bind to and infect human cells. Interestingly, neither the replication kinetic mutant nor the parental virus required human TfR1 for infection. Knock-out of TFR1 gene from the human genome did not decrease the susceptibility of Hs578T cells to virus infection. Furthermore, the expression of human TfR1, in contrast to mouse TfR1, did not enhance the susceptibility of MMTV-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, human TfR1 is dispensable for infection and another cell surface molecule mediates the MMTV entry into human cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data explain the mechanism enabling MMTV to form \u2018host-range variants\u2019 in non-murine cells that has been known for a long time, the basis of which remained obscure. Our findings may expand our understanding of how viruses gain capability to cross species-specific barriers to infect new hosts.

Most children can immunologically contain or eradicate the organism without pathology developing. However, in a minority, the organism overcomes the immunological constraints, proliferates and causes TB disease. Each year a million children develop TB disease, with a quarter dying. While it is known that young children and those with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease, our understanding of risk factors for this transition is limited. The most immunologically disruptive process that can happen during childhood is infection with another pathogen and yet the impact of co-infections on TB risk is poorly investigated. Many diseases have overlapping geographical distributions to TB and affect similar patient populations. It is therefore likely that infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa may impact on the risk of developing TB disease following exposure and infection, although disentangling correlation and causation is challenging. As vaccinations also disrupt immunological pathways, these may also impact on TB risk. In this article we describe the pediatric immune response to M. tuberculosis and then review the existing evidence of the impact of co-infection with other pathogens, as well as vaccination, on the host response to M. tuberculosis. We focus on the impact of other organisms on the risk of TB disease in children, in particularly evaluating if co-infections drive host immune responses in an age-dependent way.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, mortality and association with clinical entities of influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, and adenoviruses in patients with ARI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During September 2014 till May 2015, 143 respiratory inpatients samples for viral testing collected from central Hospital in Northwest of Iran. A real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay was done to allow in one test the detection of influenza A and B viruses. Also, RSV and adenovirus were identified by Immunochromatography test. RESULTS: Twenty-four (46%) cases were positive for influenza A, which 11 (46%) of them were subtype H1N1 and 13 (54%) cases were subtype H3N2. Also, 21 (40%) cases were positive for influenza B, 5 (10%) cases were positive for RSV, and 2 (4%) cases were positive for adenovirus. One of the patients was positive for both influenza A and adenovirus. Two of the patients were positive for both influenza A and RSV. None of the patients were positive for coronavirus.

Currently, there is no specific vaccine or effective antiviral available. Anti-CHIKV Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer (CPMO) was evaluated for its antiviral efficacy and cytotoxcity in human cells and neonate murine model. Two CPMOs were designed to block translation initiation of a highly conserved sequence in CHIKV non-structural and structural polyprotein, respectively. Pre-treatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 signficantly suppressed CHIKV titre, CHIKV E2 protein expression and prevented CHIKV-induced CPE. CPMO1 activity was also CHIKV-specific as shown by the lack of cross-reactivity against SINV or DENV replication. When administered prophylactically in neonate mice, 15 \u03BCg/g CPMO1v conferred 100% survival against CHIKV disease. In parallel, these mice demonstrated significant reduction in viremia and viral load in various tissues. Immunohistological examination of skeletal muscles and liver of CPMO1v-treated mice also showed healthy tissue morphology, in contrast to evident manifestation of CHIKV pathogenesis in PBS- or scrambled sCPMO1v-treated groups. Taken together, our findings highlight for the first time that CPMO1v has strong protective effect against CHIKV infection. This warrants future development of morpholino as an alternative antiviral agent to address CHIKV infection in clinical applications.","publish_time":"2015-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Shirley; Chen, Huixin; Chen, Caiyun Karen; Min, Nyo; Chu, Justin Jang Hann","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4649900.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep12727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26224141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Morpholino Oligomer"],"organizations":["SINV","DENV","CHIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV infection","CHIKV-specific","CHIKV non-structural","CHIKV disease","suppressed CHIKV titre","CHIKV-induced CPE","CHIKV E2 protein expression","evident manifestation of CHIKV pathogenesis","Anti-CHIKV Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer","treated mice","neonate mice","human cells","liver of CPMO1v","g CPMO1v","antiviral efficacy","alternative antiviral agent","CPMO1 activity","specific vaccine","Pre-treatment of HeLa cells","neonate murine model","scrambled sCPMO1v-treated groups","warrants future development of morpholino","viremia","contrast","PBS","conserved sequence","healthy tissue morphology","viral load","significant reduction","cytotoxcity","strong protective effect","reactivity","SINV","time","debilitating","Immunohistological examination of skeletal muscles","structural polyprotein","translation initiation","various tissues","lack of cross","\u03BCg","survival","DENV replication","persistent arthralgia","clinical applications","Chikungunya virus"],"language":"en"},

In spite of the enormous clinical burden caused by RSV infections, there remains no efficacious RSV vaccine. CD8 T cells mediate viral clearance as well as provide protection against a secondary RSV infection. However, RSV-specific CD8 T cells may also induce immunopathology leading to exacerbated morbidity and mortality. Many of the crucial functions performed by CD8 T cells are mediated by the cytokines they produce. IFN-\u03B3 and TNF are produced by CD8 T cells following RSV infection and contribute to both the acceleration of viral clearance and the induction of immunopathology. To prevent immunopathology, regulatory mechanisms are in place within the immune system to inhibit CD8 T cell effector functions after the infection has been cleared. The actions of a variety of cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-4, play a critical role in the regulation of CD8 T cell effector activity. Herein, we review the current literature on CD8 T cell responses and the functions of the cytokines they produce following RSV infection.

Disease threats to wild snow leopards have not been investigated.Methods and Results: Between 2008 and 2015, twenty snow leopards in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia were captured and immobilised for health screening and radio-collaring. Blood samples and external parasites were collected for pathogen analyses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. The animals showed no clinical signs of disease, however, serum antibodies to significant zoonotic pathogens were detected. These pathogens included, Coxiella burnetii, (25% prevalence), Leptospira spp., (20%), and Toxoplasma gondii (20%). Ticks collected from snow leopards contained potentially zoonotic bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.Conclusions: The zoonotic pathogens identified in this study, in the short-term did not appear to cause illness in the snow leopards, but have caused illness in other wild felids. Therefore, surveillance for pathogens should be implemented to monitor for potential longer- term disease impacts on this snow leopard population.","publish_time":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esson, Carol; Skerratt, Lee F.; Berger, Lee; Malmsten, Jonas; Strand, Tanja; Lundkvist, \u00C5ke; J\u00E4rhult, Josef D.; Michaux, Johan; Mijiddorj, Tserennadmid Nadia; Bayrak\u00E7\u0131smith, Rana; Mishra, Charudutt; Johansson, \u00D6rjan","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39063a51b2de47e1b2ef019d04eac54ca1c3f2d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6567154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231481/; https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2019.1604063","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxiella"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Asia","South Gobi","Mongolia"],"keyphrases":["wild snow leopards","snow leopard population","significant zoonotic pathogens","zoonotic bacteria","Disease threats","illness","term disease impacts","clinical signs of disease","Coxiella burnetii","South Asia","wild felids","South Gobi desert of Mongolia","ELISA","pathogen analyses","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Panthera uncia","Campylobacter","Rickettsia","Bacteroides","Streptococcus","genera Bacillus","serum antibodies","external parasites","microscopic agglutination test","Staphylococcus","Conclusions","threatened apex predator","MAT","mountains of Central","Background","generation sequencing","health screening","NGS","techniques","radio-collaring","Blood samples","prevalence","animals","potential","study","Methods","Ticks","Toxoplasma gondii","Results","Leptospira","surveillance"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a novel numerical method of estimating the germicidal effect of UR-UVGI systems for air exhaled by ward patients was introduced. The method adopts and modifies the concept of ventilation efficiency because the germicidal effect depends upon how the air containing airborne infectious particles flows and stays within UV-radiated area. A case study based on a four-patient ward showed that UV doses were correlated with the age of the air exhaled by a source patient, as expected. Moreover, the UV doses were considerably affected by the position of the UR-UVGI system. Inactivation rates of the influenza virus estimated using the UV doses, were in the range of 48\u201374%, and those of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were 68\u201390% in the breathing area of a neighboring patient.

However, most countries, including those with widely available critical care services, lack sufficient specialized staff, medical equipment, and ICU space to provide timely, usual critical care for a large influx of additional patients. Shifting critical care disaster preparedness efforts to augment limited, essential critical care (emergency mass critical care [EMCC]), rather than to marginally increase unrestricted, individual-focused critical care may provide many additional people with access to life-sustaining interventions. In 2007, in response to the increasing concern over a severe influenza pandemic, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care (hereafter called the Task Force) convened to suggest the essential critical care therapeutics and interventions for EMCC. Task Force suggestions EMCC should include the following: (1) mechanical ventilation, (2) IV fluid resuscitation, (3) vasopressor administration, (4) medication administration for specific disease states (eg, antimicrobials and antidotes), (5) sedation and analgesia, and (6) select practices to reduce adverse consequences of critical illness and critical care delivery. Also, all hospitals with ICUs should prepare to deliver EMCC for a daily critical care census at three times their usual ICU capacity for up to 10 days. Discussion By using the Task Force suggestions for EMCC, communities may better prepare to deliver augmented critical care in response to disasters. In light of current mass critical care data limitations, the Task Force suggestions were developed to guide preparedness but are not intended as strict policy mandates.

The methodology involved the use of an oscillating saw with variable saw blade frequencies and different saw blade contact loads on dry human femora. Released airborne particles were counted per diameter by a particle counter inside a closed and controlled environment. Results corroborated with the hypotheses: higher frequencies or lower contact loads resulted in higher numbers of aerosol particles produced. However, it was found that even in the best-case scenario tested on dry bone, the number of aerosol particles produced was still high enough to provide a potential health risk to the forensic practitioners.

Historically, RNA viruses produced in cell cultures have been identified using electron microscopy, in which virus identification is performed by eye. Such an approach is time consuming and depends on manual controls. Moreover, detailed knowledge about RNA viruses is required. This study introduces the Entropy-Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (Entropy-ANFIS method), which can be used to automatically detect RNA virus images. This system consists of four stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and testing the Entropy-ANFIS method with respect to the correct classification ratio. In the pre-processing stage, a center-edge changing method is used, in which the Euclidian distances are calculated from the center pixels to the edges of the imaged object. In this way, the distance vector is obtained. This calculation is repeated for each RNA virus image. In feature extraction, stage norm entropy, logarithmic energy and threshold entropy values are calculated to form the feature vector. The obtained feature vector is independent of the rotation and scale of the RNA virus image. In the classification stage, the feature vector is given as input to the ANFIS classifier, ANN classifier and FCM cluster. Finally, the test stage is performed to evaluate the correct classification ratio of the Entropy-ANFIS algorithm for the RNA virus images. The correct classification ratio has been determined as 95.12% using the proposed Entropy-ANFIS method.","publish_time":"2013-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dogantekin, Esin; Avci, Engin; Erkus, Oznur","journal":"Digital Signal Processing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7b5122ce22d459f1127f0896fb787f657050eac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1051200413000195; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsp.2013.01.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051200413000195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Entropy-Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System","FCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classification stage","Entropy-ANFIS algorithm","RNA virus images","proposed Entropy-ANFIS method","stage norm entropy","RNA viruses","correct classification ratio","obtained feature vector","ANFIS classifier","feature extraction","Entropy-Adaptive Network","threshold entropy values","pre-processing stage","virus identification","test stage","distance vector","medical image processing","ANN classifier","center pixels","center-edge","Fuzzy Inference System","logarithmic energy","fields of medicine","rotation","respect","scale","input","electron microscopy","FCM cluster","cell cultures","time consuming","edges","stages","manual controls","Abstract Innovations","study","detailed knowledge","imaged object","Euclidian distances","approach","way","eye","calculation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed how virus detection affected clinical management. During a 27-month period, clinical and laboratory information was collected from all children and adults in two Swiss tertiary centres whose respiratory samples were tested for respiratory viruses with a 16-plex rtPCR test. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 140 of 254 patients (55%); of those patients, there was \u22651 virus in 91 (65%), \u2265 1 bacterium in 53 (38%), and \u22651 virus and bacterium in 11 (8%). Of 80 patients with viral infection, 59 (74%) received antibiotics. Virus detection was associated with discontinuation of antibiotics in 2 of 20 adults (10%) and 6 of 14 children (43%). Overall 12 adults (34%) and 18 children (67%) were managed correctly without antibiotics after virus detection (p = 0.01). When taking biomarkers, radiologic presentations, and antibiotic pre-treatment into account, the impact of rtPCR and appropriateness of therapy for clinically viral infections increased to 100% in children and 62% in adults. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions seems possible. Appropriate application of rtPCR results in respiratory tract infections should be encouraged.","publish_time":"2017-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mayer, Lena M.; Kahlert, Christian; Rassouli, Frank; Vernazza, Pietro; Albrich, Werner C.","journal":"Pneumonia (Nathan)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f061e6719f37322dba23bdecaaa47e68fb2c04b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5471894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28702306/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41479-017-0028-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","adults","clinical utility of multiple virus detection","patients","respiratory tract infections","respiratory samples","respiratory viruses","impact of rtPCR","Appropriate application of rtPCR results","plex rtPCR test","clinical management","viral infections","discontinuation of antibiotics","bacterium","antibiotic pre-treatment","substantial reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions","real-time polymerase chain reaction","Swiss tertiary centres","retrospective cohort study","account","laboratory information","appropriateness of therapy","Significance","radiologic presentations","month period","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","biomarkers","BACKGROUND","Pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Currently, measles is a re-emerging disease in developed countries. MV is usually quantified in infectious units as determined by limiting dilution and counting of plaque forming unit either directly (PFU method) or indirectly from random distribution in microwells (TCID50 method). Both methods are time-consuming (up to several days), cumbersome and, in the case of the PFU assay, possibly operator dependent. METHODS/FINDINGS: A rapid, optimized, accurate, and reliable technique for titration of measles virus was developed based on the detection of virus infected cells by flow cytometry, single round of infection and titer calculation according to the Poisson\u0027s law. The kinetics follow up of the number of infected cells after infection with serial dilutions of a virus allowed estimation of the duration of the replication cycle, and consequently, the optimal infection time. The assay was set up to quantify measles virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using antibody labeling of viral glycoprotein, virus encoded fluorescent reporter protein and an inducible fluorescent-reporter cell line, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, performing the assay takes only 24\u201330 hours for MV strains, 12 hours for VSV, and 52 hours for HIV-1. The step-by-step procedure we have set up can be, in principle, applicable to accurately quantify any virus including lentiviral vectors, provided that a virus encoded gene product can be detected by flow cytometry.","publish_time":"2011-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grigorov, Boyan; Rabilloud, Jessica; Lawrence, Philip; Gerlier, Denis","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b67e259fd64cd00d911f3f78b16e5c9c5fa04ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3168471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21915289/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["titration of measles virus","vesicular stomatitis virus","detection of virus infected cells","human immunodeficiency virus type","hours","PFU assay","VSV","number of infected cells","flow cytometry","PFU method","HIV","MV strains","methods","fluorescent reporter protein","single round of infection","optimal infection time","TCID50 method","developed countries","inducible fluorescent-reporter cell line","important human pathogen","considerable number of deaths","affected individuals","strong immunosuppression","titer calculation","serial dilutions","random distribution","viral glycoprotein","Paramyxoviridae family","estimation","reliable technique","microwells","duration","re-emerging disease","antibody","member","gene product","replication cycle","Poisson\u0027s law","plaque","infectious units","case","operator dependent","lentiviral vectors","BACKGROUND","days","FINDINGS","step-by-step procedure","principle","kinetics","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Subjects (n=2430) in the MPCR group were older, had more complex chronic conditions, and were admitted to the PICU more often compared with the non-MPCR (n=2349) group. Subjects in the MPCR group had more positive tests (42.4% vs. 14.4%, p\u003C0.01), received fewer days of antibiotics (4 vs. 5 median antibiotic days, p\u003C0.01), fewer chest radiographs performed, (59% vs. 78%, p\u003C0.01), and were placed in isolation longer (20 vs. 0 median isolation-hours, p\u003C0.01) compared with the non-MPCR group.

We investigate the effects of planning horizons on epidemic dynamics. We developed an epidemiological agent-based model (along with an ODE analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with the individuals\u2019 payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the epidemic peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection.

Maintaining these women on sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (BUP) is an evidence-based practice but BUP-SL is associated with several disadvantages that an extended-release (XR) BUP formulation could eliminate. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is conducting an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Medication treatment for Opioid-dependent expectant Mothers (MOMs), to compare mother and infant outcomes of pregnant women with OUD treated with BUP-XR, relative to BUP-SL. A second aim is to determine the relative economic value of utilizing BUP-XR. Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6\u201330 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization. Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits through 12 months postpartum. Participants will be invited to participate in two sub-studies to evaluate the: 1) mechanisms by which BUP-XR may improve mother and infant outcomes; and 2) effects of prenatal exposure to BUP-XR versus BUP-SL on infant neurodevelopment. This paper describes the key design decisions for the main trial made during protocol development. This Investigational New Drug (IND) trial uniquely uses pragmatic features where feasible in order to maximize external validity, hence increasing the potential to inform clinical practice guidelines and address multiple knowledge gaps for treatment of this patient population.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Winhusen, Theresa; Lofwall, Michelle; Jones, Hendr\u00E9e E.; Wilder, Christine; Lindblad, Robert; Schiff, Davida M.; Wexelblatt, Scott; Merhar, Stephanie; Murphy, Sean M.; Greenfield, Shelly F.; Terplan, Mishka; Wachman, Elisha M.; Kropp, Frankie; Theobald, Jeff; Lewis, Mitra; Matthews, Abigail G.; Guille, Connie; Silverstein, Michael; Rosa, Carmen","journal":"Contemp Clin Trials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9cbfa0038f5a26e987a18e29f7e54ac177f5a0b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714420300926?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2020.106014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353544/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551714420300926","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BUP","OUD","Investigational New Drug"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BUP formulation","BUP-SL status","relative economic value of utilizing BUP-XR","Medication treatment","infant outcomes of pregnant women","main trial","study medication","pragmatic randomized controlled trial","OUD","EGA","infant neurodevelopment","Participants","weekly medication visits","clinical practice guidelines","National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network","pragmatic features","evidence-based practice","Investigational New Drug","Opioid-dependent expectant Mothers","Abstract Opioid use disorder","multiple knowledge gaps","CTN","IND","open-label","key design decisions","potential","MOMs","estimated gestational age","buprenorphine","effects of prenatal exposure","extended-release","external validity","months postpartum","sublingual","patient population","paper","arm","protocol development","disadvantages","aim","ratio","recent years","weeks","mechanisms","time of randomization","sub-studies","sites","intent"],"language":"en"},

It is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. The majority of respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak. Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"McFadden, SarahAnn M.; Malik, Amyn A.; Aguolu, Obianuju G.; Willebrand, Kathryn S.; Omer, Saad B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8af6dee1d53474f1932c436d1eda5ebde381465a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302370/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231808","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","NIH","Congress"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["COVID","US response","risk of infection","public health leadership","outbreak","public perception of risk","public health messaging","health officials","health professionals","risk perceptions","general adult US population","scientific leadership","political leadership","trust","majority of respondents","CDC Director","sources of information","NIH Director","favor of strict infection prevention policies","time of survey administration","terms of age","gender","race","United States","ethnicity","adults","median score","forefront","education","president","Congress","results","online platform","sample","Coronavirus Disease","study","pandemic","questionnaire"],"language":"en"},

Complementary work on autophagy in higher eukaryotes has revealed both the deep conservation of this process, as well as novel mechanisms by which autophagy is regulated in the context of development, immunity, and neuronal homeostasis. The recent emergence of new clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-based technologies has begun facilitating efforts to define novel autophagy factors and pathways by forward genetic screening in mammalian cells. Here, we set out to develop an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters amenable to CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Genome-wide screening of our reporters in mammalian cells recovered virtually all known autophagy-related (ATG) factors as well as previously uncharacterized factors, including vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A), transmembrane protein 251 (TMEM251), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2), and TMEM41B. To validate this data set, we used quantitative microscopy and biochemical analyses to show that 1 novel hit, TMEM41B, is required for phagophore maturation. TMEM41B is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein distantly related to the established autophagy factor vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), and our data show that these two factors play related, albeit not fully overlapping, roles in autophagosome biogenesis. In sum, our work uncovers new ATG factors, reveals a malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions, and provides a valuable resource (http://crispr.deniclab.com) for further mining of novel autophagy mechanisms.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shoemaker, Christopher J.; Huang, Tina Q.; Weir, Nicholas R.; Polyakov, Nicole J.; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Denic, Vladimir","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/185bc5c5addfa50d75d15b288537d11bd4a4aa5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6459555.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2007044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933966/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel autophagy factors","known autophagy-related","mining of novel autophagy mechanisms","field of autophagy research","established autophagy factor vacuole membrane protein","CRISPR-associated protein","transmembrane protein","new ATG factors","uncharacterized factors","novel mechanisms","TMEM41B","expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters amenable","malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions","genetic screening","Cas9 screening","novel hit","vacuolar protein sorting","mammalian cells","data set","Genome-wide screening","Complementary work","power of forward genetics","recent emergence of new clustered","interspaced palindromic repeats","pathways","integral endoplasmic reticulum","higher eukaryotes","quantitative microscopy","TMEM251","homolog","foundation","VMP1","VPS37A","efforts","biochemical analyses","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","immunity","yeast","ALS2","based technologies","process","deep conservation","context of development","neuronal homeostasis","valuable resource","sum","roles","autophagosome biogenesis","phagophore maturation"],"language":"en"},

Over the last years, an increasing body of evidence led to the notion that OxPL not only contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory processes but in addition play an integral role as modulators of inflammation during acute infections. Thereby, host defense mechanisms involve the generation of oxygen radicals that oxidize ubiquitously present phospholipids, which in turn act as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These OxPL-derived DAMPs can exhibit both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions that ultimately alter the host response to pathogens.

An adenovirus isolate was obtained in simian cell lines from the carcass of a Pipistrellus kuhlii, and the complete genome sequence was reconstructed using deep sequencing technologies. The virus displayed high nucleotide identity and virtually the same genome organization as the Pipistrellus pipistrellus strain PPV1, isolated in Germany in 2007.

Treatments using antimicrobial nanoparticles have shown promise because of the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles compared to their bulk counterparts, and their unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, hybrid nanostructures of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) coated with antimicrobial, natural product (NP) nanoparticles were synthesized using a twin-head electrospray system (THES). The coated nanoparticles were then used in antimicrobial air filters to increase their antimicrobial efficiency. Electrosprayed droplets were converted to NP nanoparticles and MWCNTs through ethanol evaporation. Oppositely charged NP nanoparticles and MWCNTs were coagulated via Coulombic collisions to form hybrid nanoparticles that were deposited continuously onto an air filter medium. The size distribution and composition of the hybrid NP/MWCNT particles were characterized using a wide-range particle spectrometer (WPS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The concentration of hybrid NP/MWCNT nanoparticles was lower than that of NP nanoparticles but higher than that of MWCNTs and showed a bimodal size distribution with peak diameters of 21.1 and 49nm. TEM analyses confirmed that the NP nanoparticles were attached to the MWCNT surface with a density of ~4\u20139 particles/MWCNT. When deposited onto the filter medium, NP/MWCNT particles formed dendrites on the filter\u05F3s fiber surface. The filtration efficiency and pressure drop of the NP/MWCNT-coated filters were higher than those of pristine, NP nanoparticles-coated or MWCNTs-coated filters. The hybrid filter also exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity than those of NP or MWCNT-coated filters at identical deposited volumes (1.1\u00D710\u20132 cm3/cm2 filter). Ninety-five percent of the tested bacterial aerosols were inactivated on the NP/MWCNTs filter while only \u003C70% were inactivated on NP- or MWCNT-coated filters.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Gi Byoung; Sim, Kyoung Mi; Bae, Gwi-Nam; Jung, Jae Hee","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee5ee45366753b52ea76058be790ec3e611f8cbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094255.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850215000579; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2015.04.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850215000579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","NP/MWCNT","TEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NP nanoparticles","MWCNT nanoparticles","coated nanoparticles","hybrid nanoparticles","antimicrobial nanoparticles","MWCNT-coated filters","concentration of hybrid NP","MWCNTs filter","MWCNTs-coated filters","MWCNT particles","MWCNT surface","hybrid filter","volume ratio of nanoparticles","antimicrobial air filters","antimicrobial efficiency","cm2 filter","air filter medium","stronger antimicrobial activity","high surface","increase","hybrid nanostructures of multi-walled carbon nanotubes","airborne pathogen transmission","bimodal size distribution","s fiber surface","identical deposited volumes","airborne microorganisms","TEM analyses","filtration efficiency","transmission electron microscope","epidemic disease outbreaks","WPS","human indoor activities","dendrites","wide-range particle spectrometer","peak diameters","promise","composition","bulk counterparts","twin-head electrospray system","Coulombic collisions","natural product","THES","study","pressure","ethanol evaporation","tested bacterial aerosols","percent","chemical properties","Treatments","density","Electrosprayed droplets","nm","Abstract","cm3"],"language":"en"},

Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context. METHODS: Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those \u226465 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. RESULTS: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed vaccines, which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. CONCLUSION: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms.","publish_time":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pusch, Emanuel; Renz, Harald; Skevaki, Chrysanthi","journal":"Allergo J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86b03081a859409f85e82252c419fd7a4dc7d5f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149200.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s15007-018-1580-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32300267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory-virus induced HI","overview of respiratory virus-induced HI","respiratory syncytial virus","mechanisms of HI","role of respiratory viruses","adaptive HI","HI-based mechanisms","Respiratory viral infections","influenza virus","multiple virus strains","autoimmune disease development","development of autoimmune diseases","Adaptive heterologous immune responses","humoral cross-reactivity","current knowledge","experimental asthma","antigen results","protection","cellular cross-reactivity","detrimental outcome","heterologous immunity","detrimental effects","disease prevention","broad implications","autoimmunity","TCR","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","type","allergy","Medline","coronavirus","rhinovirus","narcolepsy","potential","focus","RSV","hygiene hypothesis","structured literature search","lack of microbial encounter","diabetes","example","hand","T cell receptor","increasing number of allergic","elements","CoV","possibilities","recent findings","alteration","CONCLUSION","transplant immunology","METHODS","myocarditis","vaccination","PubMed","allergens","Topics","Future research","developed vaccines","host","better understanding","PURPOSE","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Despite intensive vaccinations, IS-1494 like IBVs are still circulating in Iran (the dominant genotype) and spread to other countries. Here, the full-length genome of this Iranian IS-1494 like IBV was (Mahed) determined to understand its evolutionary relationships. The genome consists of 27,652 nucleotides, with mutations in most of the structural genes. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the Mahed isolate (5\u2032 UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032 UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c, and 6b, which has rarely been reported, were present in the Mahed genome. According to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, 1a, S2, M, E, N protein, Mahed isolate clustered with the QX type strain. Based on the partial 1b, S1, Mahed clustered with the Q1 strain. The full-length genome of Mahed isolate shared the highest sequence homology with Gray and JMK (90.06\u201390.07%) and was least related to the Vic-s (86.21%). These data show that evolutionary variation because of recombination in IBV plays a major role in the adaptation and origin of IBV leading to new genetic and types of the virus strain.

Panel data from 2007 to 2013 for 138 routes with HSR-air competition were used to identify the ex-post impacts of the entry of HSR services, the duration of operating HSR services since entry, and the specific impacts of HSR transportation variables such as travel time, frequency, and ticket fares on air passenger flows in China. The findings show that the entry of new HSR services in general leads to a 27% reduction in air travel demand. After two years of operating HSR services, however, the negative impact of HSR services on air passenger flows tends to further increase. The variations of the frequency in the temporal dimension and the travel time in the spatial dimension significantly affect air passenger flows. Neither in the temporal nor spatial dimensions are HSR fares strongly related to air passenger flows in China, due to the government regulation of HSR ticket prices during the period of analysis. The impacts of different transportation variables found in this paper are valuable to consider by operational HSR companies in terms of scheduling and planning of new routes to increase their competitiveness relative to airlines.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Haoran; Burghouwt, Guillaume; Wang, Jiaoe; Boonekamp, Thijs; Dijst, Martin","journal":"Applied Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0ca3a1d5d7f3e34a6500acebce925c70a79ed99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112375.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287520/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622817311335; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143622817311335","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HSR fares","entry of HSR services","HSR-air competition","entry of new HSR services","duration of operating HSR services","years of operating HSR services","air passenger flows","negative impact of HSR services","operational HSR companies","specific impacts of HSR transportation variables","air travel demand","government regulation of HSR ticket prices","China","travel time","ticket fares","temporal dimension","impacts of different transportation variables","frequency","airlines","inter-city travel","increase","planning of new routes","ex-post impacts","spatial dimensions","terms of scheduling","general leads","paper","reduction","network","competitiveness relative","period of analysis","High-speed Railway","world","variations","findings","Panel data"],"language":"en"},

The role of infections in disease pathogenesis and progression is known to be important, yet the mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated. While COPD pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are strongly associated with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), the clinical relevance of these pathogens in stable COPD patients remains unclear. Immune responses in stable and colonized COPD patients are comparable to those detected in AECOPD, supporting a role for chronic colonization in COPD pathogenesis through perpetuation of deleterious immune responses. Advances in molecular diagnostics and metagenomics now allow the assessment of microbe\u2013COPD interactions with unprecedented personalization and precision, revealing changes in microbiota associated with the COPD disease state. As microbial changes associated with AECOPD, disease severity and therapeutic intervention become apparent, a renewed focus has been placed on the microbiology of COPD and the characterization of the lung microbiome in both its acute and chronic states. Characterization of bacterial, viral and fungal microbiota as part of the lung microbiome has the potential to reveal previously unrecognized prognostic markers of COPD that predict disease outcome or infection susceptibility. Addressing such knowledge gaps will ultimately lead to a more complete understanding of the microbe\u2013host interplay in COPD. This will permit clearer distinctions between acute and chronic infections and more granular patient stratification that will enable better management of these features and of COPD.","publish_time":"2017-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Janice M.; Tiew, Pei Yee; Mac Aog\u00E1in, Miche\u00E1l; Budden, Kurtis F.; Yong, Valerie Fei Lee; Thomas, Sangeeta S.; Pethe, Kevin; Hansbro, Philip M.; Chotirmall, Sanjay H.","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a353e7728d1b05982990fd47bab435332c515b07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169176.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342288/; https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD pathogenesis","COPD pathogens","COPD interactions","microbiology of COPD","COPD disease state","stable COPD patients","acute exacerbations of COPD","colonized COPD patients","unrecognized prognostic markers of COPD","disease pathogenesis","AECOPD","chronic infections","disease severity","disease outcome","chronic colonization","role of infections","chronic states","lung microbiome","assessment of microbe","fungal microbiota","perpetuation of deleterious immune responses","microbial changes","Characterization of bacterial","therapeutic intervention","Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","granular patient stratification","precision","unprecedented personalization","Moraxella catarrhalis","metagenomics","better management","potential","clinical relevance","host interplay","renewed focus","progression","clearer distinctions","molecular diagnostics","complete understanding","infection susceptibility","major global concern","Advances","features","context of ageing populations","mechanisms","knowledge gaps"],"language":"en"},

An obvious inhibitory effect on viral RNA and protein synthesis was also observed. However, the inhibitory effect was only achieved at early phase of virus infection. The normal virus yield could be restored upon the removal of NAP treatment. The inhibitory effect might be caused by sulfhydryl-reducing capacity and metal chelating properties of NAP.

We therefore evaluated clinical and microbiological factors associated with the presence of GI symptoms in patients consulting a general practitioner (GP) for ARI. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens and clinical data from patients presenting to GPs with an ARI were prospectively collected during two winter seasons (2014-2016). Samples were tested by quantitative real-time PCR for 12 respiratory pathogen groups and for 12 enteric pathogens. RESULTS: Two hundred and four of 331 included patients (61.6%) were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Sixty-nine stools (20.8%) were positive for at least one pathogen (respiratory and/or enteric). GI symptoms were more likely declared in case of laboratory confirmed-enteric infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.2\u20139.9]; p = 0.02) or human coronavirus (HCoV) infection (aOR = 2.7; [1.2\u20136.8]; p = 0.02). Consumption of antipyretic medication before the consultation seemed to reduce the risk of developing GI symptoms for patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza (aOR = 0.3; [0.1\u20130.6]; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of GI symptoms in ARI patients could not be explained by the detection of respiratory pathogens in stools. However, the detection of enteric pathogens in stool samples could explained by the presence of GI symptoms in some of ARI cases. The biological mechanisms explaining the association between the presence of HCoVs in nasopharynx and GI symptoms need to be explored.

Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase \u2013 Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present. An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel. To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1\u20132 wk may be advised. As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sankar, Jhuma; Dhochak, Nitin; Kabra, S.

Follow up experiments indicated that passive transfer of antiserum, from MVA-VP2 immune donors to recipient mice 1h before challenge, conferred complete clinical protection and significantly reduced viraemia. These studies have been extended to determine the protective effect of MVA-VP2 vaccine-induced antiserum, when administered 48h before, or 48h after challenge. In addition, passive transfer of splenocytes was undertaken to assess if they confer any degree of immunity to immunologically na\u00EFve recipient mice. Thus, antisera and splenocytes were collected from groups of mice that had been vaccinated with MVA-VP2, or wild type MVA (MVA-wt), for passive immunisation of recipient mice. The latter were subsequently challenged with AHSV-4 (together with appropriate vaccinated or unvaccinated control animals) and protection was assessed by comparing clinical signs, lethality and viraemia between treated and control groups. All antiserum recipients showed high protection against disease (100% survival rates even in mice that were immunised 48h after challenge) and statistically significant reduction or viraemia in comparison with the control groups. The mouse group receiving splenocytes from MVA-VP2 vaccinates, showed only a 40% survival rate, with a small reduction in viraemia, compared to those mice that had received splenocytes from MVA-wt vaccinates. These results confirm the primarily humoral nature of protective immunity conferred by MVA-VP2 vaccination and show the potential of administering MVA-VP2 specific antiserum as an emergency treatment for AHSV.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvo-Pinilla, Eva; de la Poza, Francisco; Gubbins, Simon; Mertens, Peter Paul Clement; Ortego, Javier; Castillo-Olivares, Javier","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/462748f20eb8940dac46c920599f1937d6e2949d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125940.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354215000108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25643968/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354215000108","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MVA-VP2 vaccination","MVA-wt","MVA-VP2 immune donors","groups of mice","protective effect of MVA","potential of administering MVA-VP2 specific antiserum","wild type MVA","VP2 of AHSV serotype","challenge","VP2 vaccine-induced antiserum","na\u00EFve recipient mice","passive immunisation of recipient mice","passive transfer of antiserum","control groups","passive transfer of splenocytes","antiserum recipients","reduced viraemia","complete clinical protection","high protection","unvaccinated control animals","clinical signs","humoral nature of protective immunity","degree of immunity","significant reduction","small reduction","survival rates","virus neutralising antibodies","Abstract Previous studies","horses","protected interferon alpha receptor gene knock","recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara","disease","lethality","comparison","emergency treatment","IFNAR","mouse group","addition","experiments","results","antisera"],"language":"en"},

Considering this limitation, we wanted to ascertain the effectiveness of using a MERS-CoV infectious clone (icMERS-0) previously shown to replicate to higher titers than the wild-type EMC 2012 strain. We observed respiratory disease resulting from exposure to the icMERS-0 strain as measured by CT in rhesus monkeys with concomitant detection of virus antigen by immunohistochemistry.

Similar studies, as well as studies on animal viruses, were carried out in Australia by Burnet and his colleagues. One result of their extensive studies, which were summarized in great detail, was the conclusion that, with respect to their interaction with antibody, bacterial and animal viruses were basically different. Specifically, the difference resided in the stability of the union of virus and antibody, whereas bacterial viruses formed stable complexes, animal viruses formed complexes that tended to dissociate readily. The introduction of animal cell cultures as host systems greatly aided in the study of animal viruses, with respect to fewer and more readily controlled variables, and by the use of the plaque assay in enhanced quantitative reliability. In 1956, Dulbecco et al. described the interaction of two animal viruses with their respective antibodies. The results of these studies led these investigators to conclude, among other things, that animal viruses, at least the two they studied, reacted with antibodies to form complexes that did not dissociate spontaneously. This interpretation was challenged by Fazekas de St. Groth and Reid. As more animal virus-antibody systems were studied by many investigators, there seemed to be a greater accord for irreversible, rather than reversible, interaction. For this reason, in this chapter it is assumed that there are no differences between bacterial viruses, as one category, and animal viruses, as a separate category, concerning their interaction with antibodies. Rather, differences, when they exist, are considered to be related to the viruses per se. Although this chapter is intended to survey the neutralization of animal viruses, occasional reference is made to the studies on bacterial viruses when these studies are pertinent and illuminating to the topic at hand.","publish_time":"1978-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mandel, Benjamin","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d62517543cff4abed85182bc70d1b5cfb15e0e6b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352708601013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352708601013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Reid"],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Australia"],"keyphrases":["neutralization of animal viruses","study of animal viruses","interaction of bacterial viruses","animal virus-antibody systems","extensive studies","Similar studies","introduction of animal cell cultures","stable complexes","investigators","respective antibodies","chapter","differences","host systems","separate category","union of virus","plaque assay","fewer","occasional reference","Publisher Summary Various aspects","enhanced quantitative reliability","Andrewes","controlled variables","Fazekas","stability","Elford","Australia","things","greater accord","Groth","Reid","Burnet","colleagues","topic","England","conclusion","results","hand","interpretation","reason","Dulbecco"],"language":"en"},

Important advances have been made over the past decade to improve some critical points, such as safety and efficacy of the first generation of therapeutic antibodies. This type of molecules presents a significant challenge from the pharmaceutical point of view due to their characteristics, such as molecular size, stability, and solubility.

Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir\u0027s member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hamner, Lea; Dubbel, Polly; Capron, Ian; Ross, Andy; Jordan, Amber; Lee, Jaxon; Lynn, Joanne; Ball, Amelia; Narwal, Simranjit; Russell, Sam; Patrick, Dale; Leibrand, Howard","journal":"MMWR.

In this study, we identified ITZ as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus-71, rhinovirus). We demonstrate that ITZ inhibits viral RNA replication by targeting oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related protein 4 (ORP4). Consistently, OSW-1, a specific OSBP/ORP4 antagonist, also inhibits enterovirus replication. Knockdown of OSBP inhibits virus replication whereas overexpression of OSBP or ORP4 counteracts the antiviral effects of ITZ and OSW-1. ITZ binds OSBP and inhibits its function, i.e. shuttling of cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate between membranes, thereby likely perturbing the virus-induced membrane alterations essential for viral replication organelle formation. ITZ also inhibits hepatitis C virus replication, which also relies on OSBP. Together, these data implicate OSBP/ORP4 as novel molecular targets of ITZ and point to an essential role of OSBP/ORP4-mediated lipid exchange in virus replication that can be targeted by antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2015-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strating, Jeroen R.P.M.; van der Linden, Lonneke; Albulescu, Lucian; Bigay, Jo\u00EBlle; Arita, Minetaro; Delang, Leen; Leyssen, Pieter; van der Schaar, Hilde M.; Lanke, Kjerstin H.W.; Thibaut, Hendrik Jan; Ulferts, Rachel; Drin, Guillaume; Schlinck, Nina; Wubbolts, Richard W.; Sever, Navdar; Head, Sarah A.; Liu, Jun O.; Beachy, Philip A.; De Matteis, Maria A.; Shair, Matthew D.; Olkkonen, Vesa M.; Neyts, Johan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b02e71f6059bdc0eb63e7e8999869e7c6e5c31fb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3f104cb7fe4c6af07ddedea60bc0d34e735a617e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5d3cad66ff27b7d70f1895c653f79d63379af069.json; document_parses/pdf_json/75676e855f51d2bc4f7dc1c7416436a8893d72b0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fa3f4a7657de5ba9d7ac739248ab0a3191279a30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4383725.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124714011218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25640182/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124714011218; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.12.054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ITZ","OSBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overexpression of OSBP","specific OSBP","Knockdown of OSBP","enterovirus replication","essential role of OSBP","OSBP-related protein","antiviral effects of ITZ","viral RNA replication","ORP4 antagonist","hepatitis C virus replication","viral replication organelle formation","novel molecular targets of ITZ","ORP4-mediated lipid exchange","OSW","virus-induced membrane alterations essential","antiviral drugs","oxysterol-binding protein","well-known antifungal agent","poliovirus","broad-spectrum inhibitor of enteroviruses","anti-cancer activity","coxsackievirus","phosphatidylinositol","phosphate","cholesterol","membranes","data","function","rhinovirus","Itraconazole","study"],"language":"en"},

Infected cattle in general and calves in particular have also been demonstrated as major contributors of zoonotic C. parvum oocysts in the environment and have been linked to a number of waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis. Little is known on the occurrence, geographical distribution, and molecular diversity of Cryptosporidium infections affecting bovine populations in Algeria. In this study faecal specimens were randomly collected from 460 cattle aged between two days and 18 months on 10 farms located in the provinces of A\u00EFn Defla, Blida, S\u00E9tif, and Tizi Ouzou between the autumn of 2015 and the spring of 2016. Faecal samples were microscopically examined using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast technique as screening method. Microscopy-positive samples were confirmed by a commercial coproantigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bio-X Diagnostics). The identification of Cryptosporidium species and sub-genotypes in confirmed samples was conducted by PCR and sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) and the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) genes of the parasite. Overall, 52.2% (240/460) of the investigated cattle tested positive to Cryptosporidium by microscopy. The infection was widespread in all 10 farms surveyed, but was significantly more prevalent in those from Blida in the central part of the country. Bovine cryptosporidiosis affected cattle of all age groups but with different outcomes. Pre-weaned (up to one month old) calves typically presented with diarrhoea, whereas older animals mostly harboured sub-clinical infections. The commercial ELISA used only detected 15.8% (38/240) of the samples that previously tested positive by microscopy, demonstrating a poor performance in field epidemiological surveys. Sequence analysis of the 29 isolates generated at the ssu rRNA loci confirmed the presence of four Cryptosporidium species including C. parvum (72.4%), C. bovis (13.8%), C. andersoni, (3.4%), and C. ryanae (3.4%). Two additional isolates (7.0%) could only be identified at the genus level. Eight out of the 21 isolates assigned to C. parvum were identified as sub-genotype IIaA16G2R1 at the gp60 locus. C. parvum was almost exclusively found infecting pre-weaned calves, whereas C. ryanae and C. andersoni were only detected in asymptomatic animals. Bovine cryptosporidiosis is highly endemic in the surveyed area and represents a veterinary public health concern that should be adequately tackled by Algerian veterinary health authorities and policy makers.","publish_time":"2018-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ouakli, Nadia; Belkhiri, Aouatif; de Lucio, Aida; K\u00F6ster, Pamela C.; Djoudi, Mustapha; Dadda, Aness; Khelef, Djamel; Kaidi, Rachid; Carmena, David","journal":"Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da0ebda303f4ca39730247bb429b4305bbde7c82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014813/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939017302411; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405939017302411; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.02.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C. parvum","C. bovis"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Algeria"],"keyphrases":["confirmed samples","Microscopy-positive samples","Bovine cryptosporidiosis","weaned calves","Faecal samples","identification of Cryptosporidium species","parvum oocysts","Infected cattle","investigated cattle","molecular diversity of Cryptosporidium infections","enteric protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium","sub-genotypes","Blida","bovine populations","farms","additional isolates","andersoni","ryanae","harboured sub-clinical infections","ssu rRNA loci","sub-genotype IIaA16G2R1","Algerian veterinary health authorities","sequence analyses","older animals","veterinary public health concern","gp60 locus","surveyed area","Sequence analysis","asymptomatic animals","commercial ELISA","number of waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis","commercial coproantigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Neonatal calf diarrhoea","study faecal specimens","small subunit ribosomal RNA","leading cause of morbidity","modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast technique","poor performance","age groups","Bio-X Diagnostics","S\u00E9tif","mortality","policy makers","PCR","presence","major contributors of zoonotic","screening method","geographical distribution","kDa glycoprotein","provinces of A\u00EFn Defla","field epidemiological surveys","Tizi Ouzou","genes","month old","autumn","different outcomes","occurrence","month-old","environment","days","months","genus level","country","spring","bovis"],"language":"en"},

Unlike the mammalian basal mRNA decay enzymes, which largely target mRNA from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end, viruses instead use endonucleases that cleave their targets internally. This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s). Yet, how mRNA endonuclease specificity is achieved in mammalian cells remains largely unresolved. Here, we reveal key features underlying the biochemical mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Using purified KSHV SOX protein, we reconstituted the cleavage reaction in vitro and reveal that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of mRNA susceptibility observed in cells. Importantly, we establish that cleavage site specificity does not require additional cellular cofactors, as had been previously proposed. Thus, viral endonucleases may use a combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while still preserving selectivity.","publish_time":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendez, Aaron S; Vogt, Carolin; Bohne, Jens; Glaunsinger, Britt A","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfaeecd7b15a7d6d0563cd323c40681e285d70e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6294519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOX","KSHV SOX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mRNA endonuclease specificity","SOX endonuclease","cleavage reaction","cleavage site specificity","breadth of mRNA susceptibility","broad set of mRNA targets","mammalian basal mRNA decay enzymes","strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency","sequence-specific RNA binding","combination of RNA sequence","purified KSHV SOX protein","mammalian cells","accelerating messenger RNA","number of viruses","viral endonucleases","additional cellular cofactors","cellular gene expression landscape","biochemical mechanism of target recognition","residues proximal","explanation","Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","structure","degradation","key features","targeting motif","selective power","particular structural context","selectivity"],"language":"en"},

It represents the third member of genus Circovirus able to infect swine, together with PCV-1, considered non-pathogenic, and PCV-2, one of the most economically relevant viruses for the swine worldwide industry. PCV-3 was originally found by metagenomics analyses in 2015 in tissues of pigs suffering from porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, myocarditis and multisystemic inflammation. The lack of other common pathogens as potential infectious agents of these conditions prompted the suspicion that PCV-3 might etiologically be involved in disease occurrence. Subsequently, viral genome was detected in apparently healthy pigs, and retrospective studies indicated that PCV-3 was already present in pigs by early 1990s. In fact, current evidence suggests that PCV-3 is a rather widespread virus worldwide. Recently, the virus DNA has also been found in wild boar, expanding the scope of infection susceptibility among the Suidae family; also, the potential reservoir role of this species for the domestic pig has been proposed. Phylogenetic studies with available PCV-3 partial and complete sequences from around the world have revealed high nucleotide identity (\u003E96%), although two main groups and several subclusters have been described as well. Moreover, it has been proposed the existence of a most common ancestor dated around 50 years ago. Taking into account the economic importance and the well-known effects of PCV-2 on the swine industry, a new member of the same family like PCV-3 should not be neglected. Studies on epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunity and diagnosis are guaranteed in the next few years. Therefore, the present review will update the current knowledge and future trends of research on PCV-3.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klaumann, Francini; Correa-Fiz, Florencia; Franzo, Giovanni; Sibila, Marina; N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Jos\u00E9 I.; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fb1a2388d4c9483abb1b390bb0410c941bfd1b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315159.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2018.00315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available PCV","well-known effects of PCV","swine industry","swine worldwide industry","tissues of pigs","healthy pigs","Suidae family","retrospective studies","Phylogenetic studies","Porcine circovirus","family Circoviridae","virus DNA","widespread virus","years","current knowledge","porcine dermatitis","common pathogens","current evidence","new member","common ancestor","member of genus Circovirus able","present review","potential infectious agents","potential reservoir role","reproductive failure","nephropathy syndrome","myocarditis","species","conditions","future trends of research","scope of infection susceptibility","economic importance","complete sequences","multisystemic inflammation","epidemiology","pathogenesis","immunity","relevant viruses","high nucleotide identity","wild boar","diagnosis","account","lack","suspicion","fact","domestic pig","metagenomics analyses","viral genome","main groups","subclusters","existence","disease occurrence"],"language":"en"},

Current computerized surveillance systems in many countries have demonstrated their usefulness in detecting specified communicable-diseases.

This paper proposes an on-line real-time mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance. It is based on the on-line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is designed and implemented on a simulated environment of the Taiwan\u0027s national health insurance IC card system. The proposed policy and rules are defined according to the CDC regulations. Timely, sensitive and cost-effective, EDICTS complements the existing successive level of CDC reporting system as a fast-response control channel.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Jyh-Win; Hou, Ting-Wei","journal":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e2c9f2f4eb33812e4458660db84d6fcb2b92bd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114944.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260707000326; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260707000326","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EDICTS","notifiable infectious diseases control","disease control","CDC regulations","on-line health IC card system","existing successive level of CDC reporting system","Taiwan\u0027s national health insurance IC card system","specified communicable-diseases","on-line real-time mechanism","weekly data reporting mode","time lag","data collection","spread of emerging","real time","registration station","fast-response control channel","proposed policy","Current computerized surveillance systems","registration process of primary care practices","SARS","severe acute respiratory syndrome","transmission","avian influenza","countries","emergency departments","critical issue","simulated environment","processing","usefulness","Center","bird flu","Abstract Timeliness","paper","rules","responses","prototype"],"language":"en"},

Crossing these choke points sets a pathogen on the pathway to epidemic emergence. While many viruses spill over to infect new or alternative hosts, only a few accomplish this transition\u2014and the reasons for the success of those pathogens are still unclear. Here, we consider this issue related to the emergence of animal viruses, where factors involved likely include the ability to efficiently infect the new animal host, the demographic features of the initial population that favour onward transmission, the level of shedding and degree of susceptibility of individuals of that population, along with pathogen evolution favouring increased replication and more efficient transmission among the new host individuals. A related form of emergence involves mutations that increased spread or virulence of an already-known virus within its usual host. In all of these cases, emergence may be due to altered viral properties, changes in the size or structure of the host populations, ease of transport, climate change or, in the case of arboviruses, to the expansion of the arthropod vectors. Here, we focus on three examples of viruses that have gained efficient onward transmission after spillover: influenza A viruses that are respiratory transmitted, HIV, a retrovirus, that is mostly blood or mucosal transmitted, and canine parvovirus that is faecal:oral transmitted. We describe our current understanding of the changes in the viruses that allowed them to overcome the barriers that prevented efficient replication and spread in their new hosts. We also briefly outline how we could gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and variability in order to better anticipate these events in the future.

Since the first outbreak of PDCoV in the United States in 2014, this novel porcine coronavirus has been detected in South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, and China. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HN-2014, was isolated from piglets with severe diarrhea on a pig farm in Henan Province, China, and examined with a specific immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. Genomic analysis showed that CHN-HN-2014 shares 91.6%\u201399.4% nucleotide identity with other known PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of CHN-HN-2014 was further investigated in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets. Both kinds of piglets developed clear clinical symptoms, including vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and severe diarrhea, by 2days postinoculation (DPI), and diarrhea persisted for about 5\u20136 days. Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 DPI in challenged 5-day-old pigs and until 18 DPI in challenged 21-day-old pigs.

The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. RESULTS: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.","publish_time":"2012-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boixeda, Ramon; Rabella, Nuria; Sauca, Goretti; Delgado, Maria; Mart\u00EDnez-Costa, Xavier; Mauri, Montserrat; Vicente, Vanessa; Palomera, Elisabet; Serra-Prat, Mateu; Capdevila, Josep Ant\u00F3n","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e3344bab4007d0b919ca28f879e1b6452178041.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3379868.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s30568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22745532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PATIENTS","viral etiology","bacterial etiology","viral techniques","unknown etiology","analytical parameters","viral diagnostic techniques","COPD identification","Respiratory infection","etiology of new AE-COPD cases","sputum culture","molecular biology techniques","conventional sputum test","laborious diagnostic techniques","respiratory syndromes","etiological identification of COPD exacerbations","different groups","cell culture","cost-effective tests","paired serology tests","acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","atypical bacteria","immunofluorescence","common cause","immunochromatography","usefulness","positive result","polymerase chain reaction","experience","order","seroconversion","studies","period","years","pathogens","work","significant differences","PURPOSE","profitability","METHODS","aim","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"}]}

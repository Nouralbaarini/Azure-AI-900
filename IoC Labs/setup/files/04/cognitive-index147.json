We report the cryo-EM structure of COVID-19 virus full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at 2.9-\u00C5 resolution. In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified \u03B2-hairpin domain at its N terminus. A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase.

Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colizzi, Marco; Bortoletto, Riccardo; Silvestri, Marta; Mondini, Federica; Puttini, Elena; Cainelli, Chiara; Gaudino, Rossella; Ruggeri, Mirella; Zoccante, Leonardo","journal":"Brain Behav Immun Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f7166d6338b0e7f7ed0ac4f19a737deee617ace.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313886/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100073; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354620300387; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354620300387?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-existing SSD","history suggestive of COVID","infection","SARS-CoV","diagnosis of SSD","pre-existing mental health conditions","physical symptoms","presence of SARS","medical history","healthcare system","psychological distress","novel coronavirus","psychological impact","coronavirus disease","fatal condition","persisting health preoccupations","years old adolescent","Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit","unnecessary healthcare utilization","inpatient admission","Child","vulnerable individuals","detailed clinical case","current presentation","dysfunctional preoccupation","possible exacerbation","low dose of antipsychotic","antidepressant","testing negative","importance","Somatic symptom disorder","fear","burden","concerns","risks","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Two novel viruses, Malsoor virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus, Phlebovirus) and a novel adenovirus (AdV) (family, Adenoviridae genus, Mastadenovirus), were identified from Rousettus bats in the Maharashtra State of India. This study was done to develop and optimize real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for Malsoor virus and real time and nested PCR for adenovirus from Rousettus bats. METHODS: For rapid and accurate screening of Malsoor virus and adenovirus a nested polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan-based real-time PCR were developed. Highly conserved region of nucleoprotein gene of phleboviruses and polymerase gene sequence from the Indian bat AdV isolate polyprotein gene were selected respectively for diagnostic assay development of Malsoor virus and AdV. Sensitivity and specificity of assays were calculated and optimized assays were used to screen bat samples. RESULTS: Molecular diagnostic assays were developed for screening of Malsoor virus and AdV and those were found to be specific. Based on the experiments performed with different parameters, nested PCR was found to be more sensitive than real-time PCR; however, for rapid screening, real-time PCR can be used and further nested PCR can be used for final confirmation or in those laboratories where real-time facility/expertise is not existing. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the development and optimization of nested RT-PCR and a TaqMan-based real-time PCR for Malsoor virus and AdV. The diagnostic assays can be used for rapid detection of these novel viruses to understand their prevalence among bat population.","publish_time":"2017-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shete, Anita M.; Yadav, Pragya; Kumar, Vimal; Nikam, Tushar; Mehershahi, Kurosh; Kokate, Prasad; Patil, Deepak; Mourya, Devendra T.","journal":"Indian J Med Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5460580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28574020/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1447_15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AdV"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["nested PCR","real-time PCR","optimization of nested RT-PCR","accurate screening of Malsoor virus","diagnostic assay development of Malsoor virus","nested polymerase chain reaction","novel adenovirus","rapid screening","Indian bat AdV","optimized assays","specificity of assays","Molecular diagnostic assays","real-time facility","novel viruses","Rousettus bats","polymerase gene sequence","polyprotein gene","TaqMan","rapid detection","bat population","bat samples","study","real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction","family Bunyaviridae","Adenoviridae genus","conserved region of nucleoprotein gene of phleboviruses","emerging infectious disease","important reservoirs","laboratories","unknown viral diseases","expertise","Mastadenovirus","prevalence","different parameters","final confirmation","Maharashtra State of India","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","experiments","METHODS","RESULTS","INTERPRETATION","BACKGROUND","Sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Biomarkers were screened out of hematological parameters for risk stratification. Method Confirmed COVID-19 adult patients in Suzhou were included. The patient data was collected, and the results of laboratory examinations were compared between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. A ROC was calculated to compare the diagnostic performance of candidate indexes, and dynamic levels of hematological indexes were compared between the two groups. Result 75 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46.6 \u00B1 14 years, and 45 patients were male. All patients were classified into two groups: the mild/moderate group and the severe group. WBC, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels of the severe group were significantly higher (P \u003C 0.05) than the mild/moderate, and the lymphocyte was lower. The ROC test showed that the hematological parameters had a larger AUC than that of inflammatory factors. There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels between the two groups on day 1 (P \u003C 0.05). However, NLR of the severe group was higher than the mild/moderate on days 1, 4 and 14 (P \u003C 0.01), and so was D-dimer on days 1, 7 and 14 (P \u003C 0.05). Conclusion The common COVID-19 abnormal hematological indexes on admission included hyperfibrinogenemia, lymphopenia, the elevation of D-dimer, and leukopenia, which were significantly different between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. Furthermore, the dynamic change of NLR and D-dimer level can distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from the mild/moderate.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Jianhong; Kong, Jindan; Wang, Wei; Wu, Meiying; Yao, Lin; Wang, Zhaoyue; Jin, Jun; Wu, Depei; Yu, Xin","journal":"Thromb Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7400110e77de9824ff53797dfade054fa9a9cf80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201241.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049384820301699?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384820301699; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WBC","NLR"],"locations":["Suzhou"],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","severe group","moderate group","groups","common COVID","dynamic levels of hematological indexes","hematological parameters","D-dimer level","abnormal hematological indexes","clinical features of COVID","fibrinogen levels","elevation of D","adult patients","cases","dynamic change of NLR","lymphocyte ratio","days","diagnostic performance of candidate indexes","Suzhou China","ROC test","hyperfibrinogenemia","larger AUC","lymphopenia","admission","years","neutrophil","significant difference","mean age","inflammatory factors","Abstract Objective","results of laboratory examinations","WBC","Conclusion","risk stratification","leukopenia","Method","male","Biomarkers","patient data"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. Methods We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. Results We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%)and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic(not at all 48.5%)The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siniscalchi, Monica; Zingone, Fabiana; Savarino, Edoardo Vincenzo; D\u0027Odorico, Anna; Ciacci, Carolina","journal":"Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2a4c69136ca058fc30f83c8feb7a1a0dc515ac5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425731/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1590865820302206; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1590865820302206?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.05.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CeD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CeD patients","elderly patients","proportion of patients","COVID","e-mail CeD adult patients","CeD healthcare","free food","comorbidities","possible shortness of gluten","possible lack of food","University of Salerno","University of Padua","South Italy","lifelong gluten-free diet","North Italy","remote consultations","Celiac Disease","web survey","remote consultation approach","Abstract Background Coronavirus Disease","lockdown","women","email addresses","Veneto","Campania","pandemic","psychological point of view","severe complications","indirect effects","deaths","challenging experience","therapy","Methods","epidemic","world","opportunity","answers","perception","Discussion","females"],"language":"en"},

These modulators are often small synthetic compounds and most act as agonists and to a much lesser extent as antagonists. Some of them have reached preclinical and clinical trials, and only one has been approved by the FDA and EMA, imiquimod. The key to the success of these modulators probably lies in their combination with other therapies as recently demonstrated.

This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education. Results Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries\u2019 guidelines. Conclusions Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice. Further work needs to be undertaken on the level of training/education provided to family members in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ji Yeon; Pardosi, Jerico Franciscus; Seale, Holly","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18d974723052f0e2a2252691db19ae332463fe7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132722.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655319308922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31919010/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655319308922","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPC","World Health Organization","Open Grey, Grey Matters","Embase","Global Health","Google"],"locations":["Indonesia","Australia","Canada","England","United States","Bangladesh","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["health care workers","family members","IPC activities","Global Health","IPC education","IPC policies","IPC guides","acute health care facility","acute health care settings","Health Department","inpatient care","IPC measures","IPC precautions","IPC strategies","IPC program","Ministry of Health websites","Recognition of family caregivers","World Health Organization website","western countries","family member hand hygiene","target country","patient involvement","involvement of patients","middle-income country","Asian countries","low-income country","high-income country","cultural values","cultural influences","target countries\u2019 guidelines","Prevention website","Bangladesh","familial involvement","Indonesia","role of carer","infection prevention","level of training","South Korea","healthcare arrangements","study","types of caring activities","advanced Google search","role of patients\u2019 families","Open Grey","Grey Matters","World Bank","Disease Control","Information Sharing","Web of Science","Google scholar","provision of information","ProQuest databases","different cultures","global organizations","associated infection","policy development","Australian Government Web Archive","Centers","Institutional Repository","CINAHL","definition","England","Canada","Medline","examples","inclusion","risk","key areas","primary actors","attention","Embase","Background","Methods","reflection","Conclusions","United States","articles","criteria","blueprint","Scopus","practice","Results"],"language":"en"},

All children \u22645 years of age consecutively admitted to Sultan Qaboos University Hospital in Oman over a 1\u2010year period between December 2007 and December 2008 with acute respiratory infections were included. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral detection was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Analyses were conducted using univariate statistical methods. Of the 259 infants and young children, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 130 samples (50%). The most prevalent viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 43%; n = 56), adenovirus (15%; n = 20), and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (11%; n = 14). Dual or multiple viral infections were found in 23 cases (18%). The three most prominent symptoms of the cohort were fever (78%; n = 201), tachypnoea (77%; n = 200), and runny nose (61%; n = 158). The majority had bronchiolitis (39%; n = 101) while 37% (n = 96) had pneumonia. RSV was more likely to affect those that were young (4 months vs. 7.5 months; P = 0.002) and had tachypnoea (93% vs. 69%; P = 0.004), lower respiratory tract infections (91% vs. 80%; P = 0.039), and bronchiolitis (57% vs. 38%; P = 0.024).

As providers assume responsibility for their diagnosis and treatment, patients have a right to expect that this will include responsibility for their safety during all aspects of care. However, increasing epidemiological data make it clear that patient safety is a global problem. Improved nursing care may prevent many adverse events, and nursing must take a stronger leadership role in this area. Although errors are almost inevitable, safety can be improved, and health care institutions are increasingly making safety a top priority. Information technology provides safety benefits by enhancing communication and delivering decision-support; its use will likely be a cornerstone for improving safety. This paper will discuss the status of patient safety from an international viewpoint, provide case studies from different countries, and discuss information technology solutions from a nursing perspective.","publish_time":"2004-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van de Castle, Barbara; Kim, Jeongeun; Pedreira, Mavilde L.G; Paiva, Abel; Goossen, William; Bates, David W","journal":"International Journal of Medical Informatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58a96473f61b4424d802410cc6b4f89ea0332a74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129980.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505604000863; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386505604000863","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety benefits","status of patient safety","Improved nursing care","health care providers","aspects of care","health care institutions","nursing perspective","patients","responsibility","information technology solutions","different countries","international viewpoint","case studies","communication","adverse events","stronger leadership role","treatment","diagnosis","trust","decision-support","epidemiological data","global problem","use","area","people","right","paper","errors","cornerstone","priority"],"language":"en"},

Major advances have been made in identifying RIG-I ligands, but our knowledge of the ligands for MDA5 remains restricted to data from transfection experiments mostly using poly(I:C), a synthetic dsRNA mimic. Here, we dissected the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2-stimulatory activity of different viral RNA species produced during picornavirus infection, both by RNA transfection and in infected cells in which specific steps of viral RNA replication were inhibited. Our results show that the incoming genomic plus-strand RNA does not activate MDA5, but minus-strand RNA synthesis and production of the 7.5 kbp replicative form trigger a strong IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 response. IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 production does not rely on plus-strand RNA synthesis and thus generation of the partially double-stranded replicative intermediate. This study reports MDA5 activation by a natural RNA ligand under physiological conditions.","publish_time":"2012-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Qian; Hato, Stanleyson V.; Langereis, Martijn A.; Zoll, Jan; Virgen-Slane, Richard; Peisley, Alys; Hur, Sun; Semler, Bert L.; van Rij, Ronald P.; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae54c83247645d94b2d03dc88efdce5e7b4af8bd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/845989d9e63ab61e5f9f5cf4292ea1001427a948.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103987.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124712003415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142662/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2012.10.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124712003415","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA transfection","minus-strand RNA synthesis","natural RNA ligand","cytosolic RNA sensors","incoming genomic plus-strand RNA","specific steps of viral RNA replication","\u03B2 production","\u03B2-stimulatory activity of different viral RNA species","strong IFN-\u03B1","\u03B2 response","ligands","RIG","study reports MDA5 activation","transfection experiments","kbp replicative form","critical role","picornavirus infection","data","infected cells","innate antiviral responses","poly","physiological conditions","generation","synthetic dsRNA mimic","results","knowledge","Major advances"],"language":"en"},

We explore its potential IPC benefits in epidemiology, laboratory infection diagnosis, and hand hygiene. RECENT FINDINGS: AI has the potential to detect transmission events during outbreaks or predict high-risk patients, enabling development of tailored IPC interventions. AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed. SUMMARY: Advantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change. Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life, often chaotic, clinical setting. Close collaboration with IPC experts to interpret outputs and ensure clinical relevance is essential.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fitzpatrick, Fidelma; Doherty, Aaron; Lacey, Gerard","journal":"Curr Treat Options Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fe08f310063ab5e6a16b2c73c4ccdd7723ebe70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095094.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40506-020-00216-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IPC experts","IPC implications","potential IPC benefits","dissemination of IPC expertise","development of tailored IPC interventions","AI hand hygiene applications","huge potential","behavior change","clinical relevance","laboratory infection diagnosis","different clinical settings","infection prevention","diagnosis of infections","performance returns","important challenges","large datasets","prospective evaluation","availability of high-quality representative datasets","consideration of biases","preexisting databases","high-risk patients","outputs","epidemiology","automatic reminders","Artificial intelligence","objective pattern recognition","outbreaks","diagnostics","speed","consistency","transmission events","control","capability of handling","future developments","baseline","need","opportunities","Advantages","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","Close collaboration","staff","feedback","SUMMARY","RECENT FINDINGS","culture","studies"],"language":"en"},

Filters are installed in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings to protect ventilation equipment and maintain healthy indoor air quality. These filters process enormous volumes of air. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of sampling used ventilation filters to assess the types and concentrations of virus aerosols present in buildings. Methods The HVAC filters from 2 large public buildings in Minneapolis and Seattle were sampled to determine the presence of human respiratory viruses and viruses with bioterrorism potential. Four air-handling units were selected from each building, and a total of 64 prefilters and final filters were tested for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial, corona, parainfluenza 1-3, adeno, orthopox, entero, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Machupo, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Representative pieces of each filter were cut and eluted with a buffer solution. Results Attempts were made to detect viruses by inoculation of these eluates in cell cultures (Vero, MDCK, and RK-13) and specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. Two passages of eluates in cell cultures or these eggs did not reveal the presence of any live virus. The eluates were also examined by polymerase chain reaction or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of viral DNA or RNA, respectively. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, 2 filters were positive for influenza B virus, and 1 filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. Conclusion These findings indicate that existing building HVAC filters may be used as a method of detection for airborne viruses. As integrated long-term bioaerosol sampling devices, they may yield valuable information on the epidemiology and aerobiology of viruses in air that can inform the development of methods to prevent airborne transmission of viruses and possible deterrents against the spread of bioterrorism agents.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goyal, Sagar M.; Anantharaman, Senthilvelan; Ramakrishnan, M.

Currently, one of the most relevant genotypes circulating worldwide is IBV-QX (GI-19), for which vaccines have been developed by passaging virulent QX strains in embryonated chicken eggs. Here we explored the attenuated phenotype of a commercially available QX live vaccine, IB Primo QX, in specific pathogens free broilers. At hatch, birds were inoculated with QX vaccine or its virulent progenitor IBV-D388, and postmortem swabs and tissues were collected each day up to eight days post infection to assess viral replication and morphological changes. In the trachea, viral RNA replication and protein expression were comparable in both groups. Both viruses induced morphologically comparable lesions in the trachea, albeit with a short delay in the vaccinated birds. In contrast, in the kidney, QX vaccine viral RNA was nearly absent, which coincided with the lack of any morphological changes in this organ. This was in contrast to high viral RNA titers and abundant lesions in the kidney after IBV D388 infection. Furthermore, QX vaccine showed reduced ability to reach and replicate in conjunctivae and intestines including cloaca, resulting in significantly lower titers and delayed protein expression, respectively. Nephropathogenic IBVs might reach the kidney also via an ascending route from the cloaca, based on our observation that viral RNA was detected in the cloaca one day before detection in the kidney. In the kidney distal tubular segments, collecting ducts and ureter were positive for viral antigen. Taken together, the attenuated phenotype of QX vaccine seems to rely on slower dissemination and lower replication in target tissues other than the site of inoculation.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laconi, A.; Weerts, E.A.W.S.; Bloodgood, J.C.G.; Deniz Marrero, J.

Objective Adjuvants are commonly used to enhance the efficacy of infectious disease vaccines, and this study asked whether Advax (Vaxine Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia), a novel noninflammatory polysaccharide adjuvant, might provide similar benefits for allergy desensitization. Methods A randomized, controlled phase 1/2 trial was undertaken in 27 adults with a history of rapid-onset systemic allergic reactions to honeybee stings and positive specific IgE levels to evaluate the safety and efficacy of honeybee venom immunotherapy (HBVIT) combined with Advax adjuvant. Venom immunotherapy (VIT) was administered monthly for 30 months after achievement of maintenance doses. Results Advax-adjuvanted HBVIT was well tolerated. Around week 14 of VIT, specific IgG4 responses peaked in both groups but increased earlier, peaked higher, and were better maintained through the end of the study in the Advax-adjuvanted arm. Several different patterns of serologic response to VIT were seen; some subjects had a dominant IgG4 response, some had a combined IgG4 and IgG1 response, and some had an exclusively IgG1 response. In some subjects specific IgE levels increased during the induction phase and then decreased, whereas in others specific IgE levels progressively decreased from the start of VIT. Conclusion Advax adjuvant favorably enhanced the immunogenicity of HBVIT, with an early and prolonged switch to specific IgG4 production. The ability of Advax adjuvant to enhance VIT efficacy warrants further study.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heddle, Robert; Smith, Anthony; Woodman, Richard; Hissaria, Pravin; Petrovsky, Nikolai","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86c8b9b65ea05ac7301c7f7a7cde6483b353eb12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112352.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300280/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674919306207; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2019.03.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674919306207","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Objective Adjuvants","Advax (Vaxine Pty Ltd","VIT"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["VIT efficacy","Conclusion Advax adjuvant","ability of Advax adjuvant","specific IgG4 production","specific IgG4 responses","subjects specific IgE levels","positive specific IgE levels","study","combined IgG4","dominant IgG4 response","Results Advax-adjuvanted HBVIT","Advax-adjuvanted arm","start of VIT","IgG1 response","efficacy of honeybee venom immunotherapy","honeybee stings","immunogenicity of HBVIT","novel noninflammatory polysaccharide adjuvant","different patterns of serologic response","Background Allergic reactions","onset systemic allergic reactions","use of costly venom extracts","efficacy of infectious disease vaccines","allergy desensitization","controlled phase","induction phase","Hymenoptera insect stings","parenteral desensitization regimens","frequent visits","safety","Australia","history of rapid","similar benefits","prolonged switch","major global clinical problem","Adelaide","Vaxine Pty","extended periods of time","trial","groups","months","achievement of maintenance doses","adults","Methods","week","Objective Adjuvants"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. RESULTS: Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randelli, Pietro Simone; Compagnoni, Riccardo","journal":"Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31a1c3da6c735b2aa5ef129aac53b23f22e66771.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183254.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335697/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-06023-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["orthopaedic patients","COVID","specific protocols","orthopaedic hospital","orthopaedic hubs","specific pathways","specific ward","positive patients","trauma surgeons","specific features","Specific courses","minor trauma","pandemic","specialized orthopaedic surgeons","general hospitals","internal protocols","non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery","emergency room","risk of overload","elective surgery","Authors","referral centres","article","RESULTS","hospital re-organization","regional recommendations","regional hub","management of clinical pathways","multi-disciplinary approach","northern Italy\u2019s experience","joint diseases","healthcare system","outpatient clinics","correct use of personal protection equipment","musculoskeletal disorders","emergencies","need","operating theatre","early stages","initial weeks","PPE","single rooms","quality of assistance","METHODS","structure","oropharyngeal swab","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

However, the ancient Chinese compatibility theory of herbs formula still remains ambiguous. Presently, this combination principle is dissected through a systems pharmacology study on the mechanism of action of a representative TCM formula, Huo-xiang-zheng-qi (HXZQ) prescription, on the treatment of functional dyspepsia (FD), a chronic or recurrent clinical disorder of digestive system, as typical gastrointestinal (GI) diseases which burden human physical and mental health heavily and widely. In approach, a systems pharmacology platform which incorporates the pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-dynamics evaluation, target fishing and network pharmacological analyses is employed. As a result, 132 chemicals and 48 proteins are identified as active compounds and FD-related targets, and the mechanism of HXZQ formula for the treatment of GI diseases is based on its three function modules of anti-inflammation, immune protection and gastrointestinal motility regulation mainly through four, i.e., PIK-AKT, JAK-STAT, Toll-like as well as Calcium signaling pathways. In addition, HXZQ formula conforms to the ancient compatibility rule of \u201CJun-Chen-Zuo-Shi\u201D due to the different, while cooperative roles that herbs possess, specifically, the direct FD curative effects of GHX (serving as Jun drug), the anti-bacterial efficacy and major accompanying symptoms-reliving bioactivities of ZS and BZ (as Chen), the detoxication and ADME regulation capacities of GC (as Shi), as well as the minor symptoms-treating efficacy of the rest 7 herbs (as Zuo). This work not only provides an insight of the therapeutic mechanism of TCMs on treating GI diseases from a multi-scale perspective, but also may offer an efficient way for drug discovery and development from herbal medicine as complementary drugs.","publish_time":"2019-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Miaoqing; Chen, Yangyang; Wang, Chao; Xiao, Wei; Chen, Shusheng; Zhang, Shuwei; Yang, Ling; Li, Yan","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef586c7c8fe46545e4d236ad74818063b1ac0c10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6336928.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.01448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30687082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chen-Zuo-Shi","Chen"],"organizations":["HXZQ","ZS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multi-symptoms","mechanism of HXZQ formula","treatment of GI diseases","multi-etiologies","ancient Chinese compatibility theory of herbs formula","curative efficacy","herbs interactions","representative TCM formula","various complex diseases","anti-bacterial efficacy","Multi-components Traditional Chinese Medicine","mechanism of action","multi-scale perspective","minor symptoms","Chen-Zuo","direct FD curative effects of GHX","gastrointestinal motility regulation","therapeutic mechanism of TCMs","FD-related targets","systems pharmacology platform","ancient compatibility rule","systems pharmacology study","herbal medicine","drug discovery","adverse effects","major accompanying symptoms-reliving bioactivities of ZS","treatment of functional dyspepsia","function modules of anti-inflammation","ADME regulation capacities of GC","development","immune protection","target fishing","pharmaco-dynamics evaluation","Huo-xiang","recurrent clinical disorder of digestive system","zheng-qi","network pharmacological analyses","active compounds","detoxication","prescription","human physical","Toll","proteins","JAK-STAT","efficient way","BZ","complementary drugs","insight","rest","PIK-AKT","mental health","cooperative roles","approach","combination principle","Calcium","result","chemicals","addition","pathways"],"language":"en"},

Here we employed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for the rapid and simple detection of toxic Alexandrium species. A set of four primers were designed based upon the conserved region of the 5.8S rRNA gene of members of the genus Alexandrium. Using this detection system, toxic Alexandrium genes were amplified and visualized as a ladder-like pattern of bands on agarose gels under isothermal condition within 60 min. The LAMP amplicons were also directly visualized by eye in the reaction tube by the addition of SYBR Green I. This LAMP assay was 10-fold more sensitive than a conventional PCR method with a detection limit of 5 cells per tube when targeting DNA from Alexandrium minutum.

The analysis of codon usage may improve our understanding of the evolution and pathogenesis of Chlamydia and allow reengineering of target genes to improve their expression for gene therapy. Here, we analyzed the codon usage of C. muridarum, C. trachomatis (here indicating biovar trachoma and LGV), C. pneumoniae, and C. psittaci using the codon usage database and the CUSP (Create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). The results show that the four genomes have similar codon usage patterns, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the third codon position. Compared with Homo sapiens, the four chlamydial species show discordant seven or eight preferred codons. The ENC (effective number of codons used in a gene)\u2010plot reveals that the genetic heterogeneity in Chlamydia is constrained by the G\u002BC content, while translational selection and gene length exert relatively weaker influences. Moreover, mutational pressure appears to be the major determinant of the codon usage variation among the chlamydial genes. In addition, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of E. coli, yeast, adenovirus and Homo sapiens. There are 23 codons showing distinct usage differences between C. trachomatis and E. coli, 24 between C. trachomatis and adenovirus, 21 between C. trachomatis and Homo sapiens, but only six codons between C. trachomatis and yeast. Therefore, the yeast system may be more suitable for the expression of chlamydial genes. Finally, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of six eukaryotes, eight prokaryotes and 23 viruses. There is a strong positive correlation between the differences in coding GC content and the variations in codon bias (r=0.905, P\u003C0.001). We conclude that the variation of codon bias between C. trachomatis and other organisms is much less influenced by phylogenetic lineage and primarily determined by the extent of disparities in GC content.

The lectin was adsorbed on all three ion exchangers, and it exhibited an N\u2010terminal sequence identical to that of soybean lectin. Of all the sugars tested, melibiose most potently inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the lectin, which was stable between pH 3\u201012 and 0\u201070 \u00B0C. The lectin evoked maximal mitogenic response at about the same molar concentration as Con A. However, the response was much weaker. The soybean lectin inhibited the activity of HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase as well as the proliferation of breast cancer MCF7 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells with an IC(50) of 2.82 \u03BCM, 2.6 \u03BCM and 4.1 \u03BCM, respectively. There was no antifungal activity. Another lectin was isolated from a different cultivar of soybean called little black soybean. The lectin was essentially similar to small glossy black soybean lectin except for a larger subunit molecular mass (31 kDa), a more potent mitogenic activity and lower thermostability.

Mice were first inoculated with BCG, and then secondarily inoculated 4 weeks later with crude extract from Mycobacterium intracellulare (cMI), an abundant atypical mycobacterium. Animals inoculated with BCG followed by cMI developed coronary arteritis with infiltration of inflammatory cells, whereas control animals inoculated with only cMI or BCG did not, suggesting that the immune response to the mycobacteria induced autoimmunity to the vascular wall. Intravenous injection with antibodies to peroxiredoxin II, a modulator of vascular remodeling and a suggested target for autoimmune vasculitis, also resulted in coronary arteritis, but only after prior inoculation with BCG.

Mice were bred as the genetically heterogeneous progeny of a cross between CB6F1 mothers and C3D2F1 fathers. Half of the mice were fed ad libitum (AL group), and the other half were subjected to 60% calorie restriction (CR group). Each mouse was tested at about 9 months of age using age-sensitive tests of immune status, and then again at about 12 months of age using age-sensitive tests of muscle function. The data were then analyzed using the method of partial least squares to determine the combinations of test weights that maximize the covariance of the weighted sum of immune measures with the weighted sum of muscle function measures. Both AL and CR mice exhibited a statistically significant relation between the immune status tests and the muscle function tests. Maximal covariance was obtained with a set of weighting coefficients consistent with our working hypothesis: mice with high levels of CD4 memory T cells (which increase with age) also had relatively low levels of muscle strength and endurance. Low strength was associated with low CD8 cells in the AL mice, with high numbers of CD8 memory cells in the CR mice and with low CD3 cells in both diet groups. The partial least squares method generates composite indices of immune status and muscle function that can be evaluated as biomarkers of aging rate in these mice. Further work will be needed to assess whether these tests predict either longevity or the trajectory of change in other age-sensitive molecular and physiological traits.","publish_time":"1997-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Richard A.; Bookstein, Fred; Van der Meulen, Jack; Engle, Sasha; Kim, Julie; Mullins, Lisa; Faulkner, John","journal":"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0956ff09f158ece19252b6274b19a1bd4514305.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzI2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CR mice","muscle function tests","age-sensitive tests of muscle function","individual mice","age-sensitive tests of immune status","immune status tests","months of age","low CD8 cells","age-sensitive molecular","low levels of muscle strength","low CD3 cells","weighted sum of muscle function measures","Low strength","rate of aging","biomarkers of aging rate","weighted sum of immune measures","CR group","AL group","composite indices of immune status","high numbers of CD8 memory cells","high levels of CD4 memory T cells","squares method","method of partial","Half","working hypothesis","candidate biomarkers","Maximal covariance","combinations of test weights","cross","significant relation","CB6F1 mothers","set of weighting coefficients consistent","trajectory of change","ad libitum","C3D2F1 fathers","heterogeneous progeny","diet groups","physiological traits","endurance","calorie restriction","longevity","longitudinal experiment","mouse","data"],"language":"en"},

From bacteria to vertebrates, life has established sophisticated mechanisms to detect and eliminate foreign genetic material or to restrict its function and replication. Tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of these mechanisms which keep foreign or unwanted nucleic acids from viruses or phages in check. Mechanisms reach from restriction-modification systems and CRISPR/Cas in bacteria and archaea to RNA interference and immune sensing of nucleic acids, altogether integral parts of a system which is now appreciated as nucleic acid immunity. With inherited receptors and acquired sequence information, nucleic acid immunity comprises innate and adaptive components. Effector functions include diverse nuclease systems, intrinsic activities to directly restrict the function of foreign nucleic acids (e.g., PKR, ADAR1, IFIT1), and extrinsic pathways to alert the immune system and to elicit cytotoxic immune responses. These effects act in concert to restrict viral replication and to eliminate virus-infected cells. The principles of nucleic acid immunity are highly relevant for human disease. Besides its essential contribution to antiviral defense and restriction of endogenous retroelements, dysregulation of nucleic acid immunity can also lead to erroneous detection and response to self nucleic acids then causing sterile inflammation and autoimmunity. Even mechanisms of nucleic acid immunity which are not established in vertebrates are relevant for human disease when they are present in pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, or helminths or in pathogen-transmitting organisms such as insects. This review aims to provide an overview of the diverse mechanisms of nucleic acid immunity which mostly have been looked at separately in the past and to integrate them under the framework nucleic acid immunity as a basic principle of life, the understanding of which has great potential to advance medicine.","publish_time":"2016-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hartmann, G.","journal":"Adv Immunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRISPR/Cas"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dysregulation of nucleic acid immunity","framework nucleic acid immunity","principles of nucleic acid immunity","diverse mechanisms of nucleic acid immunity","self nucleic acids","unwanted nucleic acids","function of foreign nucleic acids","immune sensing of nucleic acids","bacteria","sophisticated mechanisms","immune system","understanding","human disease","vertebrates","Organisms","diverse nuclease systems","restriction-modification systems","cytotoxic immune responses","foreign genetic material","viral replication","restriction of endogenous retroelements","basic principle of life","archaea","RNA interference","sequence information","antiviral defense","Cas","CRISPR","viruses","erroneous detection","intrinsic activities","sterile inflammation","phages","PKR","Effector functions","extrinsic pathways","integral parts","adaptive components","IFIT1","concert","essential contribution","parasites","ADAR1","helminths","pathogens","overview","effects act","inherited receptors","virus-infected cells","great potential","autoimmunity","check","integrity","medicine","biology","insects","Tremendous progress","genome","review"],"language":"en"},

Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Jun-Gu; Jeon, Kyeongseok; Choi, Hooncheol; Kim, Yuri; Kim, Hong-Il; Ro, Hyo-Jin; Seo, Yong Bok; Shin, Jua; Chung, Junho; Jeon, Yoon Kyung; Kim, Yang Soo; Lee, Keun Hwa; Cho, Nam-Hyuk","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/909d950f950ddc4254a53b73ad1c5ada5a41c057.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFNAR KO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein antigens","Gn vaccination","Gc vaccination","protein immunization","SFTSV genes","protein vaccines","DNA vaccines","better protection","SFTSV vaccine development","viral antigens","partial protection","protein elements","antigen-specific cellular immunity","lethal SFTSV challenge","single recombinant plasmid DNA","complete protection of IFNAR KO mice","SFTS virus","optimal combinations of DNA","specific viral therapy","cell-mediated immunity","IL","vaccine candidate","enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses","proper selection of target antigens","higher neutralizing activity","degree of protective immunity","significant level of neutralizing activity","immunized mice","gradual increase of SFTS cases","NP-NS fusion antigen","endemic regions","high mortality","emerging tick-borne disease","Flt3L","human trials","individual glycoprotein","thrombocytopenia syndrome","sufficient immunogenicity","major role","tyrosine kinase","ligand","Severe fever","incorporation of efficient adjuvant","Fms","surface glycoproteins","antibodies","infection"],"language":"en"},

First, the epidemic threshold is explicitly obtained. In particular, we show that, for any initial conditions, the epidemic eventually dies out regardless of what other factors are whenever some type of immunization awareness is considered, and vaccination has a perfect success. Moreover, the threshold is independent of the global type of awareness. Second, we compare the effect of contact and local types of awareness on the epidemic thresholds between heterogeneous networks and homogeneous networks. Specifically, we find that the epidemic threshold for the homogeneous network can be lower than that of the heterogeneous network in an intermediate regime for intensity of contact infection awareness while it is higher otherwise. In summary, our results highlight the important and crucial roles of both vaccine success and contact infection awareness on epidemic dynamics.","publish_time":"2016-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juang, Jonq; Liang, Yu-Hao","journal":"Chaos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9e92d5e753b1e662394cde7020c63252f583337.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intensity of contact infection awareness","local types of awareness","type of immunization awareness","global type of awareness","epidemic thresholds","epidemic dynamics","effect of contact","epidemic spreading model","heterogeneous networks","homogeneous networks","role of vaccine success","perfect success","Vespignani","Pastor-Satorras","Wu","Chaos","main results","intermediate regime","crucial roles","states","vaccination","following","summary","factors","initial conditions","consideration","Moreno"],"language":"en"},

On this view, we focus on epidemic spreading in the hierarchical geographical networks and study how two distinct contact patterns (i.e., homogeneous time delay (HOTD) and heterogeneous time delay (HETD) associated with geographical distance) influence the spreading speed and the variability of outbreaks. We find that, compared with HOTD and null model, correlations between time delay and network hierarchy in HETD remarkably slow down epidemic spreading and result in an upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. Proportionately, the variability of outbreaks in HETD has the lower value, but several comparable peaks for a long time, which makes the long-term prediction of epidemic spreading hard. When a seed (i.e., the initial infected node) is from the high layers of networks, epidemic spreading is remarkably promoted. Interestingly, distinct trends of variabilities in two contact patterns emerge: high-layer seeds in HOTD result in the lower variabilities, the case of HETD is opposite. More importantly, the variabilities of high-layer seeds in HETD are much greater than that in HOTD, which implies the unpredictability of epidemic spreading in hierarchical geographical networks.","publish_time":"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Zhi-Dan; Liu, Ying; Tang, Ming","journal":"Chaos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/600a17a5ea027b0aace191dc224f5b8728fb8b92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112452.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112452/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HETD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unpredictability of epidemic spreading","spreading speed","hierarchical geographical networks","HOTD result","variabilities of high","case of HETD","homogeneous time delay","heterogeneous time delay","long time","hierarchical geographical network structure","geographical distance","lower variabilities","high-layer seeds","high layers of networks","long-term prediction of epidemic","distinct contact patterns","distinct trends of variabilities","variability of outbreaks","network hierarchy","lower value","non-Poissonian statistics of human behaviors stem","correlations","study","comparable peaks","null model","upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon","initial infected node","studies","view"],"language":"en"},

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) was one of many public health organizations that sought to stop this outbreak. This agency deployed almost 2,000 individuals to West Africa during that timeframe. Deployment to these countries exposed these individuals to a wide variety of dangers, stressors, and risks. Being concerned about the at-risk populations in Africa, and also the well-being of its professionals who willingly deployed, the CDC did several things to help safeguard the health, safety, and resilience of these team members before, during, and after deployment. The accompanying special report highlights innovative pre-deployment training initiatives, customized screening processes, and post-deployment outreach efforts intended to protect and support the public health professionals fighting Ebola. Before deploying, the CDC team members were expected to participate in both internally-created and externally-provided trainings. These ranged from pre-deployment briefings, to Preparing for Work Overseas (PFWO) and Public Health Readiness Certificate Program (PHRCP) courses, to Incident Command System (ICS) 100, 200, and 400 courses. A small subset of non-clinical deployers also participated in a three-day training designed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress (CSTS; Bethesda, Maryland USA) to train individuals to assess and address the well-being and resilience of themselves and their teammates in the field during a deployment. Participants in this unique training were immersed in a Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) that simulated deployment to one of seven different types of emergencies. The CDC leadership also requested a pre-deployment screening process that helped professionals in the CDC\u2019s Occupational Health Clinic (OHC) determine whether or not individuals were at an increased risk of negative outcomes by participating in a rigorous deployment at that time. When deployers returned from the field, they received personalized invitations to participate in a voluntary, confidential, post-deployment operational debriefing one-on-one or in a group. Implementing these approaches provided more information to clinical decision makers about the readiness of deployers. It provided deployers with a greater awareness of the kinds of challenges they were likely to face in the field. The post-deployment outreach efforts reminded staff that their contributions were appreciated and there were resources available if they needed help processing any of the potentially-traumatizing things they may have experienced.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klomp, Richard W.; Jones, Laurie; Watanabe, Emi; Thompson, William W.","journal":"Prehosp Disaster Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2282c25b3ef6714db1b0aee43042d92764e5d5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113416.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7113416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","Work Overseas","Public Health Readiness Certificate Program","Occupational Health Clinic"],"locations":["West Africa","Africa"],"keyphrases":["rigorous deployment","pre-deployment briefings","post-deployment outreach efforts","pre-deployment screening process","innovative pre-deployment training initiatives","public health professionals","post-deployment operational debriefing one-on-one","public health organizations","readiness of deployers","field","CDC team members","train individuals","CDC leadership","Public Health Readiness Certificate Program","three-day training","unique training","CDC\u2019s Occupational Health Clinic","courses","resilience","Ebola","well-being","help","people","small subset of non-clinical deployers","Maryland USA","Georgia USA","West Africa","traumatizing things","customized screening processes","clinical decision makers","PHRCP","Prevention","Bethesda","CSTS","accompanying special report","Disease Control","Study of Traumatic Stress","Atlanta","OHC","PFWO","staff","Incident Command System","wide variety of dangers","Virtual Reality Environment","increased risk of negative outcomes","kinds of challenges","stressors","US Centers","ICS","information","collaboration","greater awareness","contributions","VRE","Work","group","approaches","personalized invitations","timeframe","safety","countries","teammates","different types of emergencies","resources available","risks","at-risk populations","Participants","agency","outbreak","trainings"],"language":"en"},

This device has specific properties such as (1) deactivation of airborne microbial-contaminants, (2) neutralization of indoor OH radicals and (3) being harmless to the human body. It consists of a ceramic plate as a positive ion generation electrode and a needle-shaped electrode as an electron emission electrode. Release of atomic hydrogen from the device has been investigated by the spectroscopic method. Optical emission of atomic hydrogen probably due to recombination of positive ions, H(\u002B)(H(2)O)n, generated from the ceramic plate electrode and electrons emitted from the needle-shaped electrode have been clearly observed in the He gas (including water vapour) environment. The efficacy of the device to reduce airborne concentrations of influenza virus, bacteria, mould fungi and allergens has been evaluated. 99.6% of airborne influenza virus has been deactivated with the operation of the device compared with the control test in a 1 m(3) chamber after 60 min. The neutralization of the OH radical has been investigated by spectroscopic and biological methods.

To simulate the investigating of cellular responding acute IR at single cell level further, we propose a model of P53 gene regulatory networks under radiotherapy. Our model can successfully implement the kinetics of double strand breaks (DSBs) generating and their repair, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, as well as P53-MDM2 feedback regulating.

By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV. Such a reduction may reflect discrete impairments in immune function to separate viruses, possibly those that are associated with viral persistence, or may reflect a more generalized defect in HLA class II-restricted CTL.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Silva, Shari M.; McFarland, Henry F.","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119527/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL","MV","HLA","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reduced CTL","restricted CTL","generation of CTL specific","HSV-specific CTL","reduced MV-specific CTL","mumps-specific CTL","restricted virus","FLU-specific","specific cytotoxicity","MS patients","mumps virus","large HLA class","generation of measles virus","influenza virus","restricted components","herpes simplex virus","broader reduction","molecules","separate viruses","immune function","discrete impairments","earlier observations","contrast","similar impairment","generalized defect","respect","findings","multiple sclerosis","question","viral persistence"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-\u03B1-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.","publish_time":"2002-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallgren, Per; Wil\u00E9n, Inga-Lill; Fossum, Caroline","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. hyopneumoniae"],"organizations":["ACTH","PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood cultures","blood lymphocytes","cultures of purified PBMC","milliliter blood","influence of cortisol","elevated concentrations of cortisol","Endogenous production of cortisol","Antibody production","effects of ACTH treatment","primary immunization","ability of blood leukocytes","influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","IFN-\u03B1","interferon-\u03B1","immune capacity","number of lymphocytes","Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen","suppression of mitogen responses","immune competence of pigs","neutrophil number increased","pokeweed mitogen","reduced proliferation","experimental groups","experimental model","porcine kidney cells","pseudorabies virus","interleukin","intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone","stressors\u2019","exposure","magnitude","animals","mitogens concanavalin","serum levels of antibodies","mixing","phytohemagglutinin","weeks","test","contrast","swine","rate of increase","assays","Field studies","transportation","untreated controls","relevance of","phenomena"],"language":"en"},

Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) enhances IFN-\u03B3-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class II MHC mRNA expression in IFN-\u03B3-treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-\u03B3. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 to the astrocytes, while TNF-\u03B1 alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF-\u03B1 does not act by increasing the stability of IFN-\u03B3-induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN-\u03B3 or IFN-\u03B3/TNF-\u03B1, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFN-\u03B3 or IFN-\u03B3/TNF-\u03B1. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN-\u03B3 and/or IFN-\u03B3/TNF-\u03B1. The expression of class II antigens on astrocytes, and cytokine modulation of their expression, may be important in the initiation and perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vidovic, Maria; Sparacio, Shaun M.; Elovitz, Michal; Benveniste, Etty N.","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119667/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B3","\u03B3-induced class","TNF-\u03B1","MHC mRNA expression","Optimal expression of class","interferon-\u03B3","effect of IFN","stability of IFN","antigen expression","level of expression","astrocyte class","mediated class","Astrocytes","simultaneous addition of IFN","Kinetic analysis of class","express mRNA","cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","antigens","h incubation","CHX","h time lag","treated cells","cytokine modulation","Northern blot analysis","specific level of post-transcriptional control","major histocompatibility complex","initiation","perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses","synthesized proteins","laboratory","action","APC","treatment","cycloheximide","results","Previous data","increase"],"language":"en"},

As a group, cheetah PBM responded significantly poorer than domestic cat PBM when cultured with FHV-1. However, individual cheetah responses varied widely. Supplementation of cultures with exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) significantly increased the level of response of individual cheetahs to both strains of FHV-1. Cheetah sera contained slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers to FHV-1 than did domestic cat sera, suggesting that B cells function adequately in cheetahs. When stimulated with Cryptococcus neoformans, both species had similar incidences of positive proliferative responses. These data demonstrate that cheetahs exhibit heterogeneous responses to specific antigens, similar to domestic cats. However, a lower group response to FHV-1 in cheetahs suggests species differences occur.

We report here additional studies to characterize this reaction. The effector lymphocytes in the cytotoxic reaction are also encephalitogenic as evidenced by the capacity of other aliquots of these cells to transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). We confirmed that the presence of both MBP and antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for this in vitro cytotoxic effect. This reaction (measured by (51)Cr release from labeled oligos) is dose-dependent on the effector/target ratio with marked (51)Cr release at a 20/1 ratio. Effector/target cell contact is required since: (a) (51)Cr release is not significantly increased when effector Lc and oligo are separated by a micropore membrane (28% vs. 24% spontaneous release); (b) no cytotoxic activity is present in the supernatant fluid of a toxic reaction. The adhesion of (51)Cr-labeled effector Lc to unlabeled oligo is increased in the presence of both MBP and APC (21 \u00B1 1.0% of cell adhering) as compared with effector Lc \u002B APC (12 \u00B1 2.7%), or effector Lc alone (14 \u00B1 2.8%).

Hepatitis viruses are transmitted through transfusion and result in inflammation of the liver, jaundice, hepatomegaly and anorexia and both hepatitis B and hepatitis C typical hepatitis viruses transmitted through transfusion. Several other viruses transmitted through transfusion of infected blood include human immunodeficiency virus, human t-cell lymphotropic virus and herpesviruses. The protozoans transmitted due to transfusion include Plasmodium, Trypanosoma and Leishmania. Prion diseases results from the benign form of the prion protein changing to an insoluble protease-resistant form, which leads to the formation of plagues in the brain. Another transfusion transmitted disease called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is described.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaz, Beth H.","journal":"Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88b93480c9d190d2662777090dabf23c93f0e4d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150182.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012374432600066X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012374432600066X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transfusion transmitted diseases","blood transfusion","potential transfusion transmitted agents","transfusion of infected blood","hepatitis C typical hepatitis viruses","mitigation of transfusion transmission of infectious agents","hepatitis B","various diseases","Prion diseases results","human immunodeficiency virus","benign form","Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease","prion protein","donor selection","donor testing","human t-cell lymphotropic virus","insoluble protease-resistant form","transmissible spongiform encephalopathies","anorexia","liver","hepatomegaly","jaundice","herpesviruses","chapter","Plasmodium","inflammation","TTD","Publisher Summary","Trypanosoma","Leishmania","formation of plagues","brain","prions","protozoans","table"],"language":"en"},

Recent discoveries of several novel viruses have markedly increased the repertoire of agents understood to cause presentations of acute respiratory disease. Objectives Further understanding is needed of the relative importance of newly discovered pathogens in the clinical setting to provide clinicians with an indication of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic targets. To address this, quantification of the disease burden of respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients was undertaken. Study design Disease burden caused by respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients was quantified using the World Health Organization endorsed DALY model. Diagnostic testing results from samples collected over three years for adenovirus (AdV), influenzas A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3 (PIV-1, -2 and -3), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), and previously published retrospective screening for human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, and four respiratory coronaviruses were applied to the DALY model. Disability weights were calculated per 1000 hospitalized patients in age banded groups. Results Strikingly different disease burden profiles were observed in children and adults. Adenoviruses were among the leading cause of respiratory presentations in children but not adults. HRSV and influenza A were consistently one of the greatest causes of disease regardless of sampled population. Rhinoviruses and PIV-3 were significant pathogens in all groups except those aged 16\u201364 years. In immunocompromised patients rhinoviruses were the leading viral cause of disease. Conclusions These analyses provide a framework which can be used to identify where finite resources should be directed in respiratory therapeutics and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaunt, E.

Current treatments for MS focus on attenuating immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). These treatments decrease the number of relapses, improving quality of life, but do not completely eliminate relapses so long-term disability is not improved. Therefore, therapeutic agents that protect the CNS are warranted. In both animal models as well as human patients with MS, T cell entry into the CNS is generally considered the initiating inflammatory event. In order to assess if a drug protects the CNS, any potential effects on immune cell infiltration or proliferation in the periphery must be ruled out. This protocol describes how to determine whether CNS protection observed after drug intervention is a consequence of attenuating CNS-infiltrating immune cells or blocking death of CNS cells during inflammatory insults. The ability to examine MS treatments that are protective to the CNS during inflammatory insults is highly critical for the advancement of therapeutic strategies since current treatments reduce, but do not completely eliminate, relapses (i.e., immune cell infiltration), leaving the CNS vulnerable to degeneration.","publish_time":"2016-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evonuk, Kirsten S.; Moseley, Carson E.; Doyle, Ryan E.; Weaver, Casey T.; DeSilva, Tara M.","journal":"J Vis Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a1c5b2541cb958a6280094aa3c1cd2e414fb468.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5092010.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3791/54348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27685467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS protection","CNS vulnerable","attenuating immune cell infiltration","consequence of attenuating CNS","MS treatments","death of CNS cells","immune cells","Current treatments","MS focus","inflammatory insults","T cell entry","number of relapses","initiating inflammatory event","drug intervention","therapeutic agents","advancement of therapeutic strategies","autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis","human patients","brain","central nervous system","potential effects","axonal injury","spinal cord","proliferation","major hallmark","motor","myelin destruction","conduction of nerve impulses","cognitive decline","animal models","periphery","quality of life","long-term disability","degeneration","order","protocol"],"language":"en"},

As disasters, health, and infectious disease become part of planning concern (Matthew \u0026 McDonald, 2007), greater focus on household infrastructure and EID disease outbreaks among poultry is warranted. Following Spencer (2013), this study examines the relationship between the mix of household-scale water supplies, sanitation systems, and construction materials, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry in a developing country: Vietnam. Findings of our multivariate logistic regressions suggest that a non-linear, Kuznets-shaped urban transition (Spencer, 2013) has an independent effect on the outbreak of HPAI, especially as it relates to household-level sanitation infrastructure. We conclude that the Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics in Vietnam play a significant role in explaining where poultry outbreaks occur. Using secondary data from the Census of Population and Housing, and the Agricultural Census at the District and Commune levels for the country of Vietnam, we performed logistic regression to test the relationship between outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and newly-developed \u201Ccoherence indices\u201D (Spencer, 2013) of household water supply, sanitation, and construction materials that measure nonlinear, transitional development. Results show that district-scale coherence indices are negatively and independently correlated with HPAI outbreaks, especially for sanitation. Findings also suggest that community-scale coherence of urban infrastructures is a powerful tool for predicting where HPAI poultry outbreaks are likely to occur, thereby providing health planners new tools for efficient surveillance.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spencer, James H.; Finucane, Melissa L.; Fox, Jefferson M.; Saksena, Sumeet; Sultana, Nargis","journal":"Landscape and Urban Planning","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac483ee226f5b5125ca1efe06aa2e0c7f16cff94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287618/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204619313465; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169204619313465","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spencer"],"organizations":["Matthew \u0026 McDonald","EID","Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","HPAI"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["outbreaks of HPAI","HPAI outbreaks","HPAI poultry outbreaks","EID disease outbreaks","household-level sanitation infrastructure","mix of household","outbreak of HPAI","Spencer","pandemic outbreaks of human disease","household water supply","Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics","sanitation systems","country of Vietnam","district-scale coherence indices","construction materials","scale water supplies","community-scale coherence of urban infrastructures","transitional development","relationship","Findings","Kuznets-shaped urban transition","Census of Population","Agricultural Census","developing country","Abstract Recent concerns","Emerging Infectious Diseases","multivariate logistic regressions","health planners new tools","connections","origins","powerful tool","animal populations","Commune levels","greater focus","significant role","Pathogenic Avian Influenza","McDonald","efficient surveillance","planning concern","Housing","independent effect","Matthew","secondary data","study","disasters","Results"],"language":"en"},

This is natural if we are aware that microorganisms represent the majority of the biomass on planet Earth, and that there are more microorganisms, specifically bacteria, in the human body than there are cells. To be more precise, about 1012 human cells for every 1013 bacteria, as an adaptive advantage of the replication of bacteria that occurs every 20\u201340 min, as against tens of years in the human species. Infectious diseases, in particular pandemics and local epidemics, have influenced the course of wars, all descendants, including those of rulers, and the fate of peoples and nations.1 By way of example, we should remember the importance of malaria in the fall of the Roman Empire, the Black Death in the 14th century which killed nearly a third of the world\u2019s population, and the impact of the \u201CSpanish\u201D flu pandemic of 1918\u201319 in Portugal, which in a few months decimated 1% of the Portuguese population and reduced average life expectancy to 20 years and, more recently, smallpox, declared eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980 as a result of vaccination,2 and with an estimated mortality in the 20th century of between 300 and 500 million people.3 In light of this impact, it is legitimate to consider infections one of the main modellers of mankind and of present and future generations, as well as generations of the descendants of survivors. We have also been major challengers of infectious diseases in the 21st century. Most notably in 2009 and 2010, when the 2009 influenza pandemic caused by the A (H1N1) subtype strain occurred, which originated in Mexico, with a virulence rate of 5\u201310% of the world\u2019s population, and an estimated mortality of 300,000 people. In Portugal there were 124 deaths, with an average age of 47.6 years, corresponding to a crude death rate of 1.17 per 100,000 inhabitants.4 However, it is in the first decades of the 21st century when the number of outstanding cases corresponded entirely to Coronaviridae of the family Coronaviridae, from the Latin corona, given its crown shape under electronic microscope. These viruses belong to a large family of RNA viruses, with abundant expression in the animal kingdom, particularly bats, and also other mammals, birds and reptiles. The first outbreak of coronavirus disease was the result of a cross-species barrier jump, originating in bats, and probably the musk cat as a secondary host, which began on November 16, 2002 and was named SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - CoronaVirus) in Guangdong Province, of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and extended to 17 countries, including Canada, the United States of America (USA), Australia, Germany, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Spain. The WHO declared an end to the risk of new cases on 19 May 2004, with an estimated total of approximately 8096 cases and at least 774 deaths.5","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Froes, F.","journal":"Pulmonology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0760e79585cd85c7e9a59f88188b915955aa3926.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130013.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.02.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531043720300398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151613/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531043720300398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Roman Empire"],"organizations":["World Health Organization","WHO"],"locations":["Portugal","Mexico","Republic","Canada","United States of America","Australia","Germany","France","Sweden"],"keyphrases":["century","human species","estimated mortality","human cells","world\u2019s population","United Kingdom","family Coronaviridae","bats","tens of years","Portuguese population","profound impact","replication of bacteria","major challengers of infectious diseases","human body","estimated total","microorganisms","deaths","Portugal","number of outstanding cases","risk of new cases","crude death rate","large family of RNA viruses","animal kingdom","development of humanity","future generations","Black Death","average age","beginning of humanity","result of vaccination","flu pandemic","virulence rate","descendants of survivors","influenza pandemic","United States of America","average life expectancy","main modellers of mankind","outbreak of coronavirus disease","cross-species barrier jump","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - CoronaVirus","Sweden","Guangdong Province","abundant expression","crown shape","Australia","majority","USA","France","Latin corona","history","particular pandemics","SARS-CoV","local epidemics","Roman Empire","nations","fall","Germany","biomass","musk cat","Canada","adaptive advantage","People\u2019s Republic of China","fate of peoples","way of example","importance of malaria","secondary host","planet Earth","electronic microscope","H1N1","Mexico","mammals","rulers","course of wars","countries","civilisation","Spain","Spanish","subtype strain","World Health Organization","birds","reptiles","infections","months","smallpox","inhabitants","light","decades"],"language":"en"},

This study reports the first surveillance toward understanding the diversity of RNA viruses carried by rodents and shrews in areas of high-potential contact with humans in Kenya through molecular detection. A total of 617 samples comprising fecal, urine, and tissues from 138 rodents and 5 shrews were screened for eight different families of viruses using RT-PCR assays. The results highlight the presence of diverse astroviruses, paramyxoviruses, hepeviruses, and arenavirus, circulating in both wild and synanthropic Kenyan rodents and shrews. Most of the viruses detected in this study are novel strains and some belong to the families that contain important human viral pathogens. Notably, a novel arenavirus was detected in Grammomys macmillani, a rodent species newly identified to harbor arenavirus, and it potentially represent a novel arenavirus species. Our findings demonstrate the need for continued pathogen surveillance among these small mammals as well as among the vulnerable and exposed livestock and humans.

Interventions Two periods were compared (2010-14 and 2015-17), corresponding to before and after modification of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the management of bronchiolitis in hospital. Main variables Patient sex, age, comorbidities, severity, etiology, administered treatment, bacterial infections, respiratory and inotropic support, length of stay and mortality. Results A total of 706 patients were enrolled, of which 414 (58.6%) males, with a median age of 47 days (IQR 25-100.25). Median bronchiolitis severity score (BROSJOD) upon admission: 9 points (IQR 7-11). Respiratory syncytial virus appeared in 460 (65.16%) patients. The first period (2010-14) included 340 patients and the second period (2015-17) 366 patients. More adrenalin and hypertonic saline nebulizations and more corticosteroid treatment were administered in the second period. More noninvasive ventilation and less conventional mechanical ventilation were used, and less inotropic support was needed, with no significant differences. The antibiotherapy rate decreased significantly (P =.003). Conclusions Despite the decrease in antibiotherapy, the use of nebulizations and glucocorticoids in these patients should be limited, as recommended by the guide.","publish_time":"2019-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guitart, C.; Alejandre, C.; Torr\u00FAs, I.; Balaguer, M.; Esteban, E.; Cambra, F.

Study design The SARS-CoV spike 1 (S1) protein containing the receptor binding region (RBD) was used as an immobilized target followed by incubation with a 12-mer phage display random peptide library. After four rounds of biopanning, 10 monoclonal phages with specific binding activity to the S1-RBD protein were obtained and subjected to binding and diagnostic assays. Results DNA sequencing showed that two phage displayed peptides HHKTWHPPVMHL (phage-H) and SQWHPRSASYPM (phage-S) that were specific ligands to the S1 protein. Moreover, the selected phage-H and phage-S were capable of differentiating SARS-CoV from other coronaviruses in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

They typically serve simultaneously as the agent for patients, for insurers, for their own medical practices, and for the hospital facilities where they practice. Theoretical and empirical results have demonstrated that financial relations among these different stakeholders can affect clinical outcomes as well as the efficiency and quality of care. What are the physicians\u2019 roles as the agents of Chinese patients? The marketization approach of China\u2019s economic reforms since 1978 has made hospitals and physicians profit-driven. Such profit-driven behavior and the financial tie between hospitals and physicians have in turn made physicians more the agents of hospitals rather than of their patients. While this commentary acknowledges physicians\u2019 ethics and their dedication to their patients, it argues that the current physician agency relation in China has created barriers to achieving some of the central goals of current provider-side health care reform efforts. In addition to eliminating existing perverse financial incentives for both hospitals and physicians, the need for which is already agreed upon by numerous scholars, we argue that the success of the ongoing Chinese public hospital reform and of overall health care reform also relies on establishing appropriate physician-hospital agency relations. This commentary proposes 2 essential steps to establish such physician-hospital agency relations: (1) minimize financial ties between senior physicians and tertiary-level public hospitals by establishing a separate reimbursement system for senior physicians, and (2) establishing a comprehensive physician professionalism system underwritten by the Chinese government, professional physician associations, and major health care facilities as well as by physician leadership representatives. Neither of these suggestions is addressed adequately in current health care reform activities.","publish_time":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yu; Saltman, Richard B.","journal":"Inquiry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a8d2206e8fa15801497ee0d24618adb7e34b693.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6713957.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0046958019872348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["senior physicians","physicians profit","health system","overall health care reform","health care reform efforts","current health care reform activities","financial relations","agents of hospitals","appropriate physician-hospital agency relations","major health care facilities","current physician agency relation","hospital facilities","quality of care","agents of Chinese patients","ongoing Chinese public hospital reform","comprehensive physician professionalism system","professional physician associations","physician leadership representatives","financial ties","tertiary-level public hospitals","Chinese government","physicians\u2019 roles","commentary","existing perverse financial incentives","separate reimbursement system","profit-driven behavior","central goals of current provider","multiple roles","physicians\u2019 ethics","different stakeholders","success","marketization approach of China\u2019s economic reforms","clinical outcomes","barriers","insurers","addition","efficiency","empirical results","dedication","turn","medical practices","essential steps","suggestions","need","numerous scholars"],"language":"en"},

E1\u2010deleted adenoviruses replicate to high titer in PER.C6 cells whereas subsequent deletion of E2A from the vector results in absence of replication in PER.C6 cells and drastically lowers the expression of adenovirus proteins in such cells. We therefore considered the use of an \u0394E1/\u0394E2 type 5 vector (Ad5) to deliver genes to PER.C6 cells growing in suspension with the aim to achieve high protein yield. To evaluate the utility of this system we constructed \u0394E1/\u0394E2 vector carrying different classes of protein, that is, the gene coding for spike protein derived from the Coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV), a gene coding for the SARS\u2010CoV receptor or the genes coding for an antibody shown to bind and neutralize SARS\u2010CoV (SARS\u2010AB). The \u0394E1/\u0394E2A\u2010vector backbones were rescued on a PER.C6 cell line engineered to constitutively over express the Ad5 E2A protein. Exposure of PER.C6 cells to low amounts (30 vp/cell) of \u0394E1/\u0394E2 vectors resulted in highly efficient (\u003E80%) transduction of PER.C6 cells growing in suspension. The efficient cell transduction resulted in high protein yield (up to 60 picogram/cell/day) in a 4 day batch production protocol. FACS and ELISA assays demonstrated the biological activity of the transiently produced proteins. We therefore conclude that \u0394E1/\u0394E2 vectors in combination with the PER.C6 technology may provide a viable answer to the increasing demand for high quality, high yield recombinant protein.

Wildlife trade controls are very limited because of bias on the utilization of wildlife as a natural resource to be exploited by the government agencies. The survey also shows that the current situation of wildlife consumption in key cities in China is serious, especially the consumption for food. The main consumption groups in China are male and young people with high education levels and good incomes. The key in public awareness publicity and education is to give them more information on the negative impacts of wildlife consumption and knowledge of protection.","publish_time":"2008-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Li; Hua, Ning; Sun, Shan","journal":"Biodivers Conserv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f2bd9cc60c24e8f57681c2fe7006cb813352f53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088108.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9358-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214694/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Yunnan"],"keyphrases":["utilization of wildlife","Wildlife trade controls","current situation of wildlife consumption","negative impacts of wildlife consumption","numerous wildlife markets available","China","illegal trade","Commercial trade","main consumption groups","boundary markets","city markets","food","survey","main threat","key cities","large volume","trading hubs","high education levels","various trading places","major cause of species endangerment","young people","ports","direct result","traditional medicine","animal welfare","regulation","Qinghai provinces","Yunnan","half","stores","law","bias","great destruction","good incomes","region of Guangxi","consumptive use","public awareness publicity","ecosystems","information","knowledge of protection","neighboring countries","natural resource","Data","results","brink of extinction","point","respondents","government agencies","years"],"language":"en"},

Globally, epidemics and outbreaks in any geographic region can represent international public health emergencies, and this type of threat requires a global response. Therefore, given the need to strengthen the global capacity for dealing with threats of infectious diseases, a framework is needed for collaboration on alerting the world to epidemics and responding to public health emergencies. This is necessary to guarantee a high level of security against the dissemination of communicable diseases in an ever more globalized world. In response to these needs, international health agencies have put a number of strategies into practice in order to contribute to the control of communicable diseases in poor countries.

Although the initial events of the virus entry have been already identified, data regarding intracellular virus trafficking and delivery to the replication site are limited. The purpose of this study was to map the transport route of Zika virus and to identify the fusion site within the endosomal compartment. METHODS: Tracking of viral particles in the cell was carried out with confocal microscopy. Immunostaining of two structural proteins of Zika virus enabled precise mapping of the route of the ribonucleocapsid and the envelope and, consequently, mapping the fusion site in the endosomal compartment. The results were verified using RNAi silencing and chemical inhibitors. RESULTS: After endocytic internalization, Zika virus is trafficked through the endosomal compartment to fuse in late endosomes. Inhibition of endosome acidification using bafilomycin A1 hampers the infection, as the fusion is inhibited; instead, the virus is transported to late compartments where it undergoes proteolytic degradation. The degradation products are ejected from the cell via slow recycling vesicles. Surprisingly, NH(4)Cl, which is also believed to block endosome acidification, shows a very different mode of action. In the presence of this basic compound, the endocytic hub is reprogrammed. Zika virus-containing vesicles never reach the late stage, but are rapidly trafficked to the plasma membrane via a fast recycling pathway after the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Further, we also noted that, similarly as other members of the flaviviridae family, Zika virus undergoes furin- or furin-like-dependent activation during late steps of infection, while serine or cysteine proteases are not required for Zika virus maturation or entry. CONCLUSIONS: Zika virus fusion occurs in late endosomes and is pH-dependent. These results broaden our understanding of Zika virus intracellular trafficking and may in future allow for development of novel treatment strategies. Further, we identified a novel mode of action for agents commonly used in studies of virus entry.

There was a positive correlation between the number of travelers and the number of imported cases of shigellosis, dengue (P \u003C 0.001), but not for malaria. Seasonal variability was observed for importation of salmonellosis, shigellosis and dengue fever (P = 0.005). Conclusion International travel was associated with the incidence of imported infectious diseases in Korea. Pre-travel consultation for international travelers planned to visit endemic area should be recommended strongly.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choe, Young-June; Choe, Seung-Ah; Cho, Sung-Il","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd5374c3b4ea54af662d145f26c2dca98d8d0114.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28919170/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893917301527; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893917301527; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2017.09.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System","Korea Tourism Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["imported infectious diseases","number of imported cases of shigellosis","proportion of imported cases","international travelers","Conclusion International travel","number of travelers","total cases","purpose of travel","Abstract Background International travel","incidence of salmonellosis","transmission of emerging infectious diseases","dengue fever","Pre-travel consultation","outbound travelers","largest number","seasonal variability","malaria","Korea Tourism Organization","importation of salmonellosis","association of travels","important role","National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System","age group","gender","Methods","change","Data","positive correlation","endemic area","Results","incidences"],"language":"en"},

Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. Polymerase chain reaction has ushered in a new era in virology, especially in the diagnosis of neurologic diseases. Molecular amplification methods are rapid, highly sensitive, can be automated, quantitative, and detect viruses not amenable to routine culture. User-friendly, walk-away tests with results in an hour, as well as multiplex tests that can detect 20 viruses in a single reaction, are now a reality. As the variety of test methods and commercial products proliferate, the challenges for clinicians and laboratories are selecting which tests to utilize in which clinical scenarios, and understanding how to interpret the results. The advantages and limitations of each method are discussed in this chapter, with special attention to neurologic disease.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peaper, David R.; Landry, Marie Louise","journal":"Handbook of Clinical Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58094bfa7df3c6d4d1d3fed75f7028fa9990f222.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151872.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444534880000055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015483/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444534880000055; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-53488-0.00005-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Clinical Neurology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conventional culture","rapid culture","conventional cell culture","routine culture","clinical impact","clinical scenarios","viral antigen methods","mainstay of viral diagnosis","viruses","away tests","multiplex tests","diagnosis of neurologic diseases","mainstream of clinical care","results","Handbook of Clinical Neurology volume","conventional virus isolation","variety of test methods","Molecular amplification methods","single reaction","Polymerase chain reaction","topic","inherent delay","fewer pathogens","commercial products","margin","hour","tremendous strides","challenges","chapter","special attention","clinicians","expertise","new era","virology","laboratories","years","growth","advantages","limitations","reduced time","reality","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

HO-1 induction was recently shown to result in anti-HCV activity by inducing type I interferon and inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease activity. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the anti-HCV activity of celastrol and characterize its mechanism of inhibition. Methods The anti-HCV activity of celastrol was evaluated using the HCV subgenomic replicon and HCVcc infection systems. The anti-HCV mechanism of celastrol targeting HO-1 expression was clarified using specific inhibitors against several signaling pathways. The transcriptional regulation of celastrol on target gene expression was determined using promoter-based reporter activity assay. The synergistic effect of celastrol and a numbers of clinically used anti-HCV drugs was determined via a drug combination assay. Results Celastrol inhibited HCV replication in both the HCV subgenomic and HCVcc infection systems with EC50 values of 0.37 \u00B1 0.022 and 0.43 \u00B1 0.019 \u03BCM, respectively. Celastrol-induced heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression promoted antiviral interferon responses and inhibition of NS3/4A protease activity, thereby blocking HCV replication. These antiviral effects were abrogated by treatment with the HO-1-specific inhibitor SnMP or silencing of HO-1 expression by transfection of shRNA, which indicates that HO-1 induction contributes to the anti-HCV activity of celastrol. JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were confirmed to be involved in the inductive effect of celastrol on HO-1 expression. Celastrol exhibited synergistic effects in combination with interferon-alpha, the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, and the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir. Conclusion Celastrol can serve as a potential supplement for blocking HCV replication. Targeting the JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 axis presents a promising strategy against HCV infection.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Chin-Kai; Hsu, Sung-Po; Lin, Chun-Kuang; Wu, Yu-Hsuan; Lee, Jin-Ching; Young, Kung-Chia","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee31a491e6d7a5a2446d856b7cde6b3924ed1fef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113881.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217304175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28935193/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.09.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217304175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HCV activity of celastrol","anti-HCV mechanism of celastrol","HCV infection","anti-HCV drugs","purpose Celastrol","Conclusion Celastrol","Results Celastrol inhibited HCV replication","blocking HCV replication","HCV subgenomic replicon","synergistic effect of celastrol","silencing of HO","inductive effect of celastrol","protease activity","transcriptional regulation of celastrol","Celastrol-induced heme oxygenase","gene expression activity of heme oxygenase","target gene expression","promoter-based reporter activity assay","HCVcc infection systems","interferon-alpha","antiviral interferon responses","inhibition of NS3","specific inhibitor SnMP","antiviral effects","mechanism of inhibition","synergistic effects","Nrf2","induction","NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir","NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir","drug combination assay","related factor","specific inhibitors","nuclear factor erythroid","JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase","type","inhibiting hepatitis C virus","quinone methide triterpene","numbers","potential supplement","axis","root extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii","EC50 values","promising strategy","Methods","Abstract background","present study","treatment","transfection of shRNA","disease prevention","control","aim","pathways","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

Acceptance of a novel vaccine is influenced by perceptions of risk including risk of infection, risk of death or severe illness and risk of serious vaccine side-effects. We surveyed a sample of residents from Sydney, Australia to ascertain their risk perception, attitudes towards the pandemic and willingness to accept the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine. METHODS: We sampled residents using a cross-sectional intercept design during the WHO Phase 6. Members of the public were approached in shopping and pedestrian malls to undertake the survey during September and October 2009. The survey measured perceived risk, seriousness of disease, recent behavioural changes, likely acceptance of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine and issues relating to uptake and perceived safety. RESULTS: Of the 627 respondents, the majority felt that they had a \u0022very low to low\u0022 (332/627, 52.9%) risk of acquiring H1N1. 24.5% (154/627) of respondents believed that the disease would \u0022very seriously or extremely\u0022 affect their health. Nearly half (305/627, 48.6%) reported that in response to the \u0022swine flu\u0022 outbreak they had undertaken one or more of the investigated behavioural changes. Overall, the self-reported likelihood of accepting vaccination against novel H1N1 was 54.7% (343/627). CONCLUSIONS: While, most participants did not believe they were at high risk of acquiring pandemic H1N1 2009, over half of the sample indicated that they would accept the vaccine. Participants who were vaccinated against the seasonal influenza were more likely to receive the H1N1 vaccine. Concerns about safety, the possibility of side effects and the vaccine development process need to be addressed.","publish_time":"2010-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seale, Holly; Heywood, Anita E; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Ward, Kirsten F; Lowbridge, Chris P; Van, Debbie; MacIntyre, C Raina","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e67618920b0226e661e20a2c36b4436857d9590.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2864274.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-99; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20403201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Sydney"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 vaccine","pandemic H1N1","risk of acquiring H1N1","influenza vaccine","perceived risk","novel vaccine","risk of infection","risk of death","perceptions of risk","risk perception","high risk","risk of serious vaccine side-effects","novel H1N1","vaccine development process","likely acceptance","perceived safety","seasonal influenza","Australia","sample of residents","survey","respondents","half","participants","recent behavioural changes","investigated behavioural changes","seriousness of disease","self-reported likelihood","severe illness","adults","vaccination","issues","cross-sectional intercept design","possibility","uptake","attitudes","Sydney","willingness","pedestrian malls","public","shopping","Phase","children","years","response","swine flu","majority felt","Concerns","Members","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","health"],"language":"en"},

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(6), e528\u2013e534. Background Seasonal influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are primary causes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children. New respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and influenza 2009 A(H1N1) virus have a strong impact on the pediatric population. Objectives To evaluate epidemiological and clinical features of ARTIs in hospitalized children. Methods From December 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, all children under age fifteen (n = 575) hospitalized for ARTIs were investigated for influenza A (subtype H1N1, H3N2, and 2009 H1N1) and B, RSV A and B, hMPV, and hBoV by PCR. Results Fifty\u2010one percent of samples were positive for these respiratory viruses. The frequencies of virus detection were RSV 34\u00B71%, hBoV 6\u00B78%, hMPV 5%, seasonal influenza A 5%, and seasonal influenza B 0%. From April 2009, 11\u00B76% of collected samples were influenza 2009 A(H1N1) positive. Respiratory syncytial virus activity peaked in January, hBoV in February, and hMPV in April. Seasonal influenza A was detected only between January and April 2009, while influenza 2009 A(H1N1) peaked in November. Respiratory syncytial virus and hMPV were mainly associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and with necessity of O(2) administration. The 2009 pandemic influenza was more frequently detected in elder children (P \u003C 0\u00B7001) and was associated with higher, longer\u2010lasting fevers compared with other viral infections (P \u003C 0\u00B705). Conclusions All considered viruses were involved in LRTIs. The primary clinical relevance of RSV and a similar involvement of both seasonal influenza and emerging viruses investigated were observed on the pediatric population.","publish_time":"2011-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuccotti, Gianvincenzo; Dilillo, Dario; Zappa, Alessandra; Galli, Erica; Amendola, Antonella; Martinelli, Marianna; Pariani, Elena; Salvini, Filippo; Tanzi, Elisabetta; Riva, Enrica; Giovannini, Marcello","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46dd3216b2b02daaa3cfa9fe0c6108444fdfae1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780670.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668662/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00264.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasonal influenza B","pandemic influenza","circulation of influenza virus","Background Seasonal influenza viruses","New respiratory viruses","hMPV","Respiratory syncytial virus activity","clinical features of respiratory viral infections","lower respiratory tract infections","hospitalized children","hBoV","emerging viruses","subtype H1N1","primary causes of acute respiratory tract infections","elder children","clinical features of ARTIs","frequencies of virus detection","primary clinical relevance of RSV","LRTIs","pediatric population","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","percent of samples","similar involvement","strong impact","lasting fevers","H3N2","necessity of O","Results","Objectives","administration","Zuccotti","age","e528","PCR","paper","e534","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

In infancy, wheezing illnesses are usually viral in origin, and children with more severe wheezing episodes are more likely to develop recurrent episodes of asthma and to develop asthma later in childhood. Children who develop allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (allergic sensitization), and those who wheeze with rhinoviruses (HRV) are at especially high risk for asthma. In older children and adults, HRV infections generally cause relatively mild respiratory illnesses and yet contribute to acute and potentially severe exacerbations in patients with asthma. These findings underline the importance of understanding the synergistic nature of allergic sensitization and infections with HRV in infants relative to the onset of asthma and in children and adults with respect to exacerbations of asthma. This review discusses clinical and experimental evidence of virus/allergen interactions and evaluates theories which relate immunologic responses to respiratory viruses and allergens to the pathogenesis and disease activity of asthma. Greater understanding of the relationship between viral respiratory infections, allergic inflammation, and asthma is likely to suggest new strategies for the prevention and treatment of asthma.","publish_time":"2011-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gavala, Monica; Bertics, Paul J.; Gern, James E.","journal":"Immunological Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b8c14154b61f401c102f2c84f3b88e464941189.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ce10d3f8b3407a8ebb188bb56b5de1075ab4dce1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3119863.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.2011.01031.x; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3119863?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21682739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exacerbations of asthma","onset of asthma","treatment of asthma","recurrent episodes of asthma","disease activity of asthma","HRV infections","Viral infections","viral respiratory infections","older children","adults","severe wheezing episodes","allergic inflammation","respiratory viruses","mild respiratory illnesses","severe exacerbations","synergistic nature of allergic sensitization","allergen interactions","Greater understanding","allergen-specific immunoglobulin E","allergens","experimental evidence of virus","theories","pathogenesis","relationship","immunologic responses","infants relative","new strategies","prevention","patients","origin","respect","importance","review","high risk","infancy","ages","findings","rhinoviruses","childhood"],"language":"en"},

Host innate immune response has been implicated in recognition, protection and immune pathological mechanisms. Host-viral interactions are generally initiated via host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the virus. This recognition occurs through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which are expressed on innate immune cells such as epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Multiple PRR families, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), contribute significantly to viral detection, leading to induction of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFNs), which subsequently facilitate the eradication of the virus. This review focuses on the current literature on RSV and hMPV infection and the role of PRRs in establishing/mediating the infection in both in vitro and in vivo models. A better understanding of the complex interplay between these two viruses and host PRRs might lead to efficient prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, as well as the development of adequate vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolli, Deepthi; Velayutham, Thangam Sudha; Casola, Antonella","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ca53a75582be258a2cdf9cb2172821d021f7fbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3826451.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24244872/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens2020232","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host PRRs","host pattern recognition receptors","host recognition of pathogen","innate immune cells","Host-viral interactions","hMPV infection","epithelial cells","dendritic cells","RSV","viruses","role of PRRs","immune response","respiratory syncytial virus","Acute respiratory tract infection","immune pathological mechanisms","viral detection","leading cause of morbidity","mortality","Toll","macrophages","current literature","molecular patterns","complex interplay","chemokines","induction of cytokines","PAMPs","protection","NOD","therapeutic treatments","majority of RTIs","human metapneumovirus","Multiple PRR families","interferons","better understanding","figure","neutrophils","TLRs","NLRs","RIG","RLRs","development of adequate vaccines","IFNs","review","eradication","models"],"language":"en"},

In addition to its known effects on the cardiovascular system, hypercholesterolemia leads to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage in the bone marrow, which is a non-classical target organ of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we evaluate oxidative stress and assess the effect of genomic instability on cell cycle kinetics in atherosclerotic animals and determine if sildenafil reverses these detrimental effects in bone marrow cells. METHODS: Experiments were performed in male wild-type (WT) and apolipoprotein E knockout mice (apoE(\u2212/\u2212)) (9 weeks of age). apoE(\u2212/\u2212) mice were randomly distributed into the following 2 groups: sildenafil-treated (40 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks, n = 8) and vehicle-treated (n = 8), by oral gavage. After treatment, bone marrow cells were isolated to assess the production of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, determine cell cycle kinetics and evaluate the presence of micronucleated cells. RESULTS: Sildenafil treatment reduced the cytoplasmic levels of superoxide anion (~95 % decrease, p \u003C 0.05) and decreased hydrogen peroxide (~30 % decrease, p \u003C 0.05). Moreover, we observed protective effects on the DNA of bone marrow cells, including normal cell cycling, decreased DNA fragmentation and a diminished frequency of micronucleated cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that the excessive production of ROS in atherosclerotic mice overcome the DNA repair pathways in bone marrow cells. The novelty of the present study is that the administration of sildenafil reduced ROS to baseline levels and, consequently, reverted the DNA damage and its outcomes in bone marrow cells.","publish_time":"2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bernardes, Franciane P.; Batista, Alan T.; Porto, Marcella L.; Vasquez, Elisardo C.; Campagnaro, Bianca P.; Meyrelles, Silvana S.","journal":"Lipids Health Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f8d3e900290496401f7a6557a64255fdb3ebf0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4882816.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-016-0268-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27229150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA of bone marrow cells","DNA damage","Sildenafil treatment","presence of micronucleated cells","administration of sildenafil","diminished frequency of micronucleated cells","decreased DNA fragmentation","atherosclerotic mice","cell cycle kinetics","DNA repair pathways","decreased hydrogen peroxide","detrimental effects","known effects","protective effects","present study","apoE","normal cell cycling","increased oxidative stress","excessive production of ROS","production of superoxide anions","atherosclerotic animals","apolipoprotein E knockout mice","cardiovascular system","cytoplasmic levels of superoxide anion","cardiovascular protection","weeks of age","WT","hypercholesterolemia","effect of genomic instability","male wild-type","non-classical target organ of atherosclerosis","outcomes","antioxidant therapy","data reveal","pharmacological inhibitor of phosphodiesterase","PDE5","promising candidate","Experiments","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSION","addition","day","vehicle","novelty","groups","oral gavage"],"language":"en"},

While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states. Evidence to inform measurement of preparedness is lacking. The objective of this study was to identify and define a set of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) indicators to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies. METHODS: A three-round modified Delphi technique was employed to develop indicators for PHEP. The study was conducted in Canada with a national panel of 33 experts and completed in 2018. A list of indicators was derived from the literature. Indicators were rated by importance and actionability until achieving consensus. RESULTS: The scoping review resulted in 62 indicators being included for rating by the panel. Panel feedback provided refinements to indicators and suggestions for new indicators. In total, 76 indicators were proposed for rating across all three rounds; of these, 67 were considered to be important and actionable PHEP indicators. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed an indicator set of 67 PHEP indicators, aligned with a PHEP framework for resilience. The 67 indicators represent important and actionable dimensions of PHEP practice in Canada that can be used by local/regional public health agencies and validated in other jurisdictions to assess readiness and measure improvement in their critical role of protecting community health.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Yasmin; Brown, Adalsteinn D.; Gagliardi, Anna R.; O\u2019Sullivan, Tracey; Lacarte, Sara; Henry, Bonnie; Schwartz, Brian","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed92789659fddd64f955bda40d980398b681bb6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6927653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31869359/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226489","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Delphi"],"organizations":["PHEP"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["actionable PHEP indicators","new indicators","list of indicators","PHEP framework","study","set of public health emergency preparedness","regional public health agencies","community health","measurement of preparedness","actionable dimensions of PHEP practice","Canada","Panel feedback","national panel","rating","performance measurement","infectious diseases","extreme weather","emergencies","anthropogenic events","critical role","measure improvement","different communities","jurisdictions","refinements","suggestions","readiness","Disasters","BACKGROUND","risks","modified Delphi technique","importance","actionability","scoping review","consensus","RESULTS","experts","CONCLUSIONS","resilience","Evidence","METHODS","nation-states","rounds","objective","literature","total"],"language":"en"},

Conclusions Disease categories could be classified into three groups according to the extent of change in utilization during the SARS outbreaks. Diseases with a prominent reduction were respiratory diseases, minor problems, and elective procedures. Diseases with a moderate reduction were mainly chronic diseases. Diseases with a limited reduction were acute conditions, difficult mental disorders, or procedures that could not be postponed.

METHODS: We assessed the relation between previous treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive. Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class. A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference. RESULTS: Among 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness. A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness. There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test. None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: We found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Harmony R.; Adhikari, Samrachana; Pulgarin, Claudia; Troxel, Andrea B.; Iturrate, Eduardo; Johnson, Stephen B.; Hausvater, Ana\u00EFs; Newman, Jonathan D.; Berger, Jeffrey S.; Bangalore, Sripal; Katz, Stuart D.; Fishman, Glenn I.; Kunichoff, Dennis; Chen, Yu; Ogedegbe, Gbenga; Hochman, Judith S.","journal":"N Engl J Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92b64b1d49a8b6094da70a4dad03ee9d3d24c8b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206932.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2008975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356628/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive test","untreated patients","likelihood of severe illness","risk of severe Covid","risk of severe illness","increased likelihood","increased risk","substantial increase","substantial difference","angiotensin-receptor blockers","association","common classes of antihypertensive medications","single medication class","viral receptor","history of hypertension","Bayesian methods","calcium-channel blockers","ACE inhibitors","beta-blockers","intensive care","aldosterone system","relation","previous treatment","propensity-score matching","receipt","thiazide diuretics","death","negative result","mechanical ventilation","coronavirus disease","enzyme","renin","testing","percentage points","outcomes","ACE2","CONCLUSIONS","potential","total","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we developed a high-content imaging (HCI) assay to measure DNA content and identify different phases of the cell cycle. We then investigated the potential effects of cell cycle arrest on Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Cells arrested in G1 phase by serum starvation or G1/S phase using aphidicolin or G2/M phase using nocodazole showed much reduced EBOV infection compared to the untreated control. Release of cells from serum starvation or aphidicolin block resulted in a time-dependent increase in the percentage of EBOV infected cells. The effect of EBOV infection on cell cycle progression was found to be cell-type dependent. Infection of asynchronous MCF-10A cells with EBOV resulted in a reduced number of cells in G2/M phase with concomitant increase of cells in G1 phase. However, these effects were not observed in HeLa or A549 cells. Together, our studies suggest that EBOV requires actively proliferating cells for efficient replication.

Estimates from the past three decades emphasise that the present effort to contain the epidemic in the three most affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) has been insufficient, with more than 24 900 cases and about 10 300 deaths, as of March 25, 2015. Faced with such an exceptional event and the urgent response it demands, the use of randomised controlled trials (RCT) for Ebola-related research might be both unethical and infeasible and that potential interventions should be assessed in non-randomised studies on the basis of compassionate use. However, non-randomised studies might not yield valid conclusions, leading to large residual uncertainty about how to interpret the results, and can also waste scarce intervention-related resources, making them profoundly unethical. Scientifically sound and rigorous study designs, such as adaptive RCTs, could provide the best way to reduce the time needed to develop new interventions and to obtain valid results on their efficacy and safety while preserving the application of ethical precepts. We present an overview of clinical studies registered at present at the four main international trial registries and provide a simulation on how adaptive RCTs can behave in this context, when mortality varies simultaneously in either the control or the experimental group.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lanini, Simone; Zumla, Alimuddin; Ioannidis, John P A; Caro, Antonino Di; Krishna, Sanjeev; Gostin, Lawrence; Girardi, Enrico; Pletschette, Michel; Strada, Gino; Baritussio, Aldo; Portella, Gina; Apolone, Giovanni; Cavuto, Silvio; Satolli, Roberto; Kremsner, Peter; Vairo, Francesco; Ippolito, Giuseppe","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7738dbffafaefd40ae2b91ef52c3c127655f92e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129402.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881871/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309915701064; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309915701064; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(15)70106-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Liberia","Sierra Leone"],"keyphrases":["non-randomised studies","valid results","Ebola-related research","adaptive RCTs","present effort","use of randomised controlled trials","overview of clinical studies","valid conclusions","potential interventions","new interventions","Ebola outbreak","basis of compassionate use","scarce intervention-related resources","unprecedented challenge","Guinea","Liberia","parts of west Africa","safety","simulation","rigorous study designs","main international trial registries","Sierra Leone","affected countries","urgent response","time","large residual uncertainty","decades","epidemic","efficacy","best way","application of ethical precepts","exceptional event","ethics","context","cases","experimental group","mortality","Estimates","Summary","deaths"],"language":"en"},

The first, Hendra virus, has caused disease in horses and/or humans in Australia every five years since it first emerged in 1994. Nipah virus has caused a major outbreak of disease in pigs and humans in Malaysia in the late 1990s and has also caused human mortalities in Bangladesh annually since 2001. Increased knowledge of fruit bat population dynamics and disease ecology will help improve our understanding of processes driving the emergence of diseases from bats. For this, a transdisciplinary approach is required to develop appropriate host management strategies that both maximise the conservation of bat populations as well as minimise the risk of disease outbreaks in domestic animals and humans.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Breed, Andrew C.; Field, Hume E.; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Daszak, Peter","journal":"Biological Conservation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11b99299fc6cd28599409cc858b22d57e0945f8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096729.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2006.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226079/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632070600156X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000632070600156X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Australia","Malaysia","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["humans","disease ecology","significant disease","domestic animals","major outbreak of disease","risk of disease outbreaks","conservation of bat populations","Australia","wild fruit bats","human mortalities","human health","emergence of diseases","Nipah virus","significant threat","Hendra virus","Increased knowledge of fruit bat population dynamics","series of emerging diseases","Abstract Wildlife populations","Malaysia","pigs","appropriate host management strategies","Asia","horses","understanding of processes","reservoirs of pathogens","viruses","transdisciplinary approach","Bangladesh","years","paper"],"language":"en"},

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by first-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The best first-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3\u20135 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defined in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48\u201372 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses.

Proteomics provides a critical data source for such models, but currently lacks robust de novo methods for network construction, which could bring important insights in systems biology. RESULTS: We have evaluated the construction of network models using methods derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We show that approximately scale-free peptide networks, composed of statistically significant modules, are feasible and biologically meaningful using two mouse lung experiments and one human plasma experiment. Within each network, peptides derived from the same protein are shown to have a statistically higher topological overlap and concordance in abundance, which is potentially important for inferring protein abundance. The module representatives, called eigenpeptides, correlate significantly with biological phenotypes. Furthermore, within modules, we find significant enrichment for biological function and known interactions (gene ontology and protein-protein interactions). CONCLUSIONS: Biological networks are important tools in the analysis of complex systems. In this paper we evaluate the application of weighted co-expression network analysis to quantitative proteomics data. Protein co-expression networks allow novel approaches for biological interpretation, quality control, inference of protein abundance, a framework for potentially resolving degenerate peptide-protein mappings, and a biomarker signature discovery.","publish_time":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibbs, David L; Baratt, Arie; Baric, Ralph S; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Smith, Richard D; Orwoll, Eric S; Katze, Michael G; McWeeney, Shannon K","journal":"J Clin Bioinforma","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3331e1bb231ae4227e4b6e8e98412b17468747a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3695838.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2043-9113-3-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23724967/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein-protein interactions","Biological networks","biological systems","Protein co-expression networks","inference of protein abundance","inferring protein abundance","biological interpretation","biological function","network construction","biological phenotypes","weighted gene co-expression network analysis","construction of network models","application of weighted co-expression network analysis","degenerate peptide-protein mappings","analysis of complex systems","important tools","important insights","quantitative proteomics data","scale-free peptide networks","significant modules","systems biology","complex high dimensional data","critical data source","gene ontology","known interactions","significant enrichment","novo methods","novel approaches","quality control","ability","mouse lung experiments","elucidating disease etiology","framework","human plasma experiment","WGCNA","higher topological overlap","concordance","eigenpeptides","CONCLUSIONS","biomarker signature discovery","BACKGROUND","module representatives","paper","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, TTSPs including TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL were tested for their ability to facilitate PEDV replication in Vero cells. Our results showed that TMPRSS2 and MSPL played significant roles in the stages of cell\u2013cell fusion and virus\u2013cell fusion, whereas HAT and DESC1 exhibited weaker effects. This activation may be involved in the interaction between TTSPs and the PEDV S protein, as the S protein extensively co-localized with TMPRSS2 and MSPL and could be cleaved by co-expression with TMPRSS2 or MSPL. Moreover, the use of Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL facilitated PEDV replication in the absence of exogenous trypsin. In sum, we identified two host proteases, TMPRSS2 and MSPL, which may provide insights and a novel method for enhancing viral titers, expanding virus production, and improving the adaptability of PEDV isolates in vitro.","publish_time":"2017-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Wen; Fan, Wenlu; Bai, Jing; Tang, Yandong; Wang, Li; Jiang, Yanping; Tang, Lijie; Liu, Min; Cui, Wen; Xu, Yigang; Li, Yijing","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d4b0efca3cb904640b8fd489fdfc413a8fae264.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5454426.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28524070/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v9050114","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV S","MSPL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MSPL","TMPRSS2","PEDV replication","TTSPs","PEDV S protein","cell fusion","adaptability of PEDV isolates","stages of cell","HAT","replication of viruses","virus production","DESC1","use of Vero cells","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","host proteases","co-expression","transmembrane serine proteases","viral titers","significant roles","progression of animal coronavirus infections","human coronaviruses","novel method","influenza","Type","absence of exogenous trypsin","spread","interaction","weaker effects","insights","study","sum","results","activation"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of any antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies, the disease is spreading at an alarming rate. A possibility of a resurgence of COVID-19 in places where lockdowns have already worked is also developing. Thus, for controlling COVID-19, vaccines may be a better option than drugs. An mRNA-based anti-COVID-19 candidate vaccine has entered a phase 1 clinical trial. However, its efficacy and potency have to be evaluated and validated. Since vaccines have high failure rates, as an alternative, we are presenting a new, designed multi-peptide subunit-based epitope vaccine against COVID-19. The recombinant vaccine construct comprises an adjuvant, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes joined by linkers. The computational data suggest that the vaccine is non-toxic, non-allergenic, thermostable, with the capability to elicit a humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The stabilization of the vaccine construct is validated with molecular dynamics simulation studies. This unique vaccine is made up of 33 highly antigenic epitopes from three proteins that have a prominent role in host-receptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity. We advocate this vaccine must be synthesized and tested urgently as a public health priority.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalita, Parismita; Padhi, AdityaK.; Zhang, Kam Y.J.; Tripathi, Timir","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f89d5c37625138c6d8520506adcc5d258efb044e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196559.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401020305234; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401020305234?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376359/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104236","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["candidate vaccine","unique vaccine","recombinant vaccine construct","anti-COVID","resurgence of COVID","multi-peptide subunit-based epitope vaccine","vaccines","Coronavirus disease","cytotoxic T-lymphocyte","helper T-lymphocyte","B-cell epitopes","emerging infectious disease","antigenic epitopes","host-receptor recognition","CTL","adjuvant","viral entry","prominent role","HTL","molecular dynamics simulation studies","alternative","proteins","high failure rates","capability","immunomodulatory therapies","phase","absence","pathogenicity","better option","immune response","linkers","places","clinical trial","computational data","public health priority","drugs","Wuhan","alarming rate","possibility","lockdowns","mRNA","stabilization","efficacy","potency","China"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to the previously reported structure of Mpro in the same space group at the same pH, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers in the structure of Mpro reported here are in the catalytically competent conformation, suggesting their conformational flexibility. We report two crystal structures of Mpro having an additional Ala at the N terminus of each protomer (M\u002BA(-1) pro), both at a resolution of 2.00 \u00C5, in space group P43212: one unbound and one bound by a substrate-like aza-peptide epoxide (APE). In the unbound form, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers of M\u002BA(-1) pro are observed in a collapsed (catalytically incompetent) conformation; whereas they are in an open (catalytically competent) conformation in the APE-bound form. The observed conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets suggests that these parts of Mpro exist in dynamic equilibrium. The structural data further suggest that the binding of APE to Mpro follows an induced-fit model. The substrate likely also binds in an induced-fit manner in a process that may help drive the catalytic cycle.","publish_time":"2007-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ting-Wai; Cherney, Maia M.; Liu, Jie; James, Karen Ellis; Powers, James C.; Eltis, Lindsay D.; James, Michael N.G.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f351d5be0c24d0b2e5dc0b8d941ce63bcbda449.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094323.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606016378; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606016378","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parts of Mpro","crystal structure of Mpro","reported structure of Mpro","SARS-CoV Mpro","crystal structures of Mpro","active sites","S1 specificity pockets","competent conformation","space group P43212","space group P21","APE-bound form","resolution","protomers","binding of APE","unbound form","pH","substrate","observed conformational flexibility","induced-fit manner","induced-fit model","SARS coronavirus main peptidase","development of anti-SARS agents","life-cycle","catalytic cycle","additional Ala","essential role","primary target","aza-peptide epoxide","N terminus","process","dynamic equilibrium","structural data","contrast"],"language":"en"},

This paper presents a systematic assessment of research investments awarded to UK institutions and global health metrics assessing disease burden. METHODS: We systematically sourced research funding data awarded from public and philanthropic organisations between 1997 and 2013. We screened awards for relevance to infection and categorised data by type of science, disease area and specific pathogen. Investments were compared with mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLD) across three time points. FINDINGS: Between 1997\u20132013, there were 7398 awards with a total investment of \u00A33.7 billion. An increase in research funding across 2011\u20132013 was observed for most disease areas, with notable exceptions being sexually transmitted infections and sepsis research where funding decreased. Most funding remains for pre-clinical research (\u00A32.2 billion, 59.4%). Relative to global mortality, DALYs and YLDs, acute hepatitis C, leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis received comparatively high levels of funding. Pneumonia, shigellosis, pertussis, cholera and syphilis were poorly funded across all health metrics. Tuberculosis (TB) consistently attracts relatively less funding than HIV and malaria. INTERPRETATION: Most infections have received increases in research investment, alongside decreases in global burden of disease in 2013. The UK demonstrates research strengths in some neglected tropical diseases such as African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, but syphilis, cholera, shigellosis and pneumonia remain poorly funded relative to their global burden. Acute hepatitis C appears well funded but the figures do not adequately take into account projected future chronic burdens for this condition. These findings can help to inform global policymakers on resource allocation for research investment.","publish_time":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Head, Michael G.; Fitchett, Joseph R.; Nageshwaran, Vaitehi; Kumari, Nina; Hayward, Andrew; Atun, Rifat","journal":"EBioMedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2865f3413974213d33b6c616deedafffdb60b29a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3e0347a1ad5e2c0f00755537de9288bc9e3261a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4739409.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.12.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396415302449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26870829/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352396415302449","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["research strengths","sepsis research","disease burden","sourced research funding data","global mortality","significant global burden of disease","pre-clinical research","global policymakers","global health metrics","systematic assessment of research investments","disease areas","high levels of funding","substantial investment","total investment","African trypanosomiasis","DALYs","leishmaniasis","acute hepatitis C","syphilis","shigellosis","cholera","Pneumonia","awards","FINDINGS","Infectious diseases account","categorised data","UK institutions","disability-adjusted life years","transmitted infections","neglected tropical diseases","account projected future chronic burdens","YLDs","type of science","decreases","notable exceptions","increases","resource allocation","condition","relevance","specific pathogen","pertussis","philanthropic organisations","BACKGROUND","paper","figures","development","METHODS","time points","INTERPRETATION","TB","HIV","malaria","Tuberculosis"],"language":"en"},

Patients and methods Sixty Patients were enrolled in the study, they were subjected to complete history taking, physical examination, laboratory investigations including complete blood count, blood gases, blood chemistry, bacteriological culture for sputum and blood, serology for atypicals, and PCR for respiratory viruses, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and PCT levels were measured. The patients were divided into two groups, group 1 included 26 patients who were culture negative for bacterial infection and group 2 included 34 patients who were culture positive. Group 2 patients were given antibiotic therapy according to the culture sensitivity. Result The results revealed that, there was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2 patients as regards age, sex, clinical manifestations, final diagnosis, white blood cell counts, blood gases, number of admitted patients, intensive care unit admission and length of hospital stay. A significant increase of PCT and CRP levels was detected in group 2 compared to group 1 at initial diagnosis. At cutoff value \u003E0.5ng/ml, PCT gave a sensitivity of 94.1%, specificity of 88.4%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 91.4%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 92% and diagnostic efficiency of 91.6% for diagnosis of respiratory tract bacterial infections. However, at a cutoff value \u003E8mg/L, CRP gave a sensitivity of 85.2%, specificity of 76.9%, PPV of 82.8%, NPV of 80% and diagnostic efficiency of 81.7%. After antibiotic therapy PCT and CRP levels dropped in group 2 patients as compared to their pre-treatment levels. Conclusion Serum PCT level could be used as a novel marker of lower respiratory tract bacterial infections for diagnosis, prognosis and follow up of therapy. This reduces side-effects of an unnecessary antibiotic use, lowers costs, and in the long-term, leads to diminishing drug resistance.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Azeem, Amal Abd; Hamdy, Gehan; Saraya, Mohamed; Fawzy, Esmat; Anwar, Enas; Abdulattif, Sherif","journal":"Egyptian Journal of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5f07c7aad9553b24ebb3a9c503e8931800bd820.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126862.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0422763813001763; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0422763813001763; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcdt.2013.07.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["value of PCT","PCT levels","blood gases","CRP levels","antibiotic therapy PCT","blood chemistry","diagnosis of respiratory tract bacterial infections","number of admitted patients","therapy of lower respiratory tract bacterial infections","culture sensitivity","complete blood count","cutoff value","white blood cell counts","novel marker of lower respiratory tract bacterial infections","final diagnosis","initial diagnosis","culture negative","culture positive","significant increase of PCT","negative predictive value","positive predictive value","total white-blood cell counts","respiratory viruses","markers of infections","bacteriological culture","Conclusion Serum PCT level","pre-treatment levels","serum C-reactive protein","prognosis","sensitive marker","NPV","PPV","specificity","diagnostic efficiency","unnecessary antibiotic use","complete history","significant difference","intensive care unit admission","laboratory investigations","sputum","physical examination","clinical manifestations","antimicrobial treatment","PCR","atypicals","sex","serology","age","length of hospital","costs","WBCs","diminishing drug resistance","side-effects","groups","Abstract Objectives","study","methods","results"],"language":"en"},

Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand.

The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome. The positive strand RNA genome is independently infectious, for most Group IV viruses. This means that in the absence of a capsid, envelope, or enclosed proteins, the RNA molecule, when inserted into a cell, is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses.

The large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. Here we present metaMix, a Bayesian mixture model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures. We show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. Results: We demonstrate the greater accuracy of metaMix compared with relevant methods, particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species. We designed metaMix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets, with a focus on viral pathogen detection; however, the principles are generally applicable to all types of metagenomic mixtures.

Our results were the first time to uncover the dynamic characteristics of PEDVs moving along the microtubules in the host cells. It is found that PEDVs kept restricted motion mode with a relatively stable speed in the cell membrane region; while performed a slow-fast-slow velocity pattern with different motion modes in the cell cytoplasm region and near the microtubule organizing center region. In addition, the return movements of small amount of PEDVs were also observed in the live cells. Collectively, our work is crucial for understanding the movement mechanisms of PEDV in the live cells, and the proposed work also provided important references for further analysis and study on the infection mechanism of PEDVs.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Wei; Li, Yangyang; Kang, Wenjie; Wang, Xin; Wu, Xuping; Wang, Shouyu; Liu, Fei","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d91c2ac8b93129970cedf7baaf3688e8026c2ca4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6362069.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37789-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718724/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["live cells","infection mechanism of PEDVs","live Vero cells","host cells","transport behaviors of PEDVs","dynamic characteristics of PEDVs","cell cytoplasm region","cell membrane region","center region","study","infection mechanism of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","slow-fast","proposed work","labeled viruses","different motion modes","slow velocity pattern","restricted motion mode","movement mechanisms of PEDV","stable speed","contagious enteric disease","largest extent","important references","analysis","quantum dot","single particle tracking technique","method","intact infectivity","return movements of small","microtubules","time","addition","order","results"],"language":"en"},

However, whether abused women from non-Western cultures experience similar post-traumatic responses to intimate partner violence is less documented. Objectives The objectives of this paper were (1) to review the literature for information about post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese women survivors of intimate partner violence; (2) to provide a synthesis of the literature on post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women; and (3) to identify implications for practice and to suggest directions for research relating to post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women. Design A systematic review of the literature. Data Sources Following a systematic search for relevant literature in computerized databases and manual searches of English and Chinese language publications, five papers reporting on four studies conducted in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and the United States were included in the review. Review Methods Abstracts meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by two of the authors and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Full papers for selected abstracts were then retrieved and assessed independently by the same reviewers. Results The present literature review revealed a paucity of information relating to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms or diagnoses in abused Chinese women. Nevertheless, a link between post-traumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence was demonstrated by the reviewed papers. Conclusions Caution should be exercised when making comparison of the findings across the four studies because of the inherent methodological differences. Also, as the assessment tools have not been validated for culture-bound interpretation of trauma and symptom manifestation, comparisons of findings for Chinese women to women in Western literature should be undertaken with due consideration. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are discussed.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, C. H.; Tiwari, A.; Fong, D.Y.T.; Ho, P.

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the Chinese airport network (CAN) via complex network theory. It is found that although the topology of CAN has remained steady during the past few years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which have changed the relative importance of airports and airlines.

We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities.","publish_time":"2010-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jun; Cao, Xian-Bin; Du, Wen-Bo; Cai, Kai-Quan","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa7094234bc71c19d615cc130ca8c2ef98f543a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127146.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2010.05.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288080/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437110004723; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437110004723","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cargo traffic","passenger traffic","Chinese airport network","evolution of traffic flow","complex network theory","infrastructure of aviation industry","different kinds of cities","accelerated globalization process","economy","exponential form","years","evident seasonal fluctuations","passengers","correlations","rapid development","critical role","relative importance of airports","important indicators of economic growth","today\u2019s world","airlines","dynamic switchings","cargoes","past","Abstract","topology","paper","countries"],"language":"en"},

However, it has the disadvantage of not considering definitive diagnoses. Here, we attempted to definitively diagnose pathogens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) immediately after the prescription surveillance system detected an outbreak. Specimens were collected from 50 patients with respiratory infections. PCR was used to identify the pathogens, which included 14 types of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Infectious agents including M. pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, and parainfluenza virus were detected in 54% of patients. For the rapid RSV diagnosis kit, sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 85%. For the rapid adenovirus diagnosis kit, no positive results were obtained; therefore, sensitivity could not be calculated and specificity was 100%. Many patients were found to be treated for upper respiratory tract infections without the diagnosis of a specific pathogen. In Japan, an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infection began in 2011, and our results suggested that this outbreak may have included false-positive cases. By combining syndromic surveillance and PCR, we were able to rapidly and accurately identify causative pathogens during a recent respiratory infection outbreak.","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sugiura, Hiroaki; Fujimoto, Tsuguto; Sugawara, Tamie; Hanaoka, Nozomu; Konagaya, Masami; Kikuchi, Kiyoshi; Hanada, Eisuke; Okabe, Nobuhiko; Ohkusa, Yasushi","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a33e3ade1bf2a47195051d6d458baa2001ab72a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3581269.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23509772/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/746053","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","recent respiratory infection outbreak","PCR","Syndromic surveillance","patients","respiratory syncytial virus","rapid RSV diagnosis kit","pneumoniae infection","prescription surveillance system","rapid adenovirus diagnosis kit","upper respiratory tract infections","rapid method","types of common respiratory viruses","Infectious agents","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","causative pathogens","positive results","sensitivity","specificity","parainfluenza virus","early detection of agents","emerging infectious diseases","false-positive cases","bioterrorism","rhinovirus","enterovirus","polymerase chain reaction","specific pathogen","disadvantage","definitive diagnoses","Japan","Specimens"],"language":"en"},

Methods Surviving SARS patients were seen at least twice within 3 months after discharge and underwent SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody testing, pulmonary function testing, and chest radiography and/or high-resolution CT (HRCT) examinations at Chinese PLA General Hospital. The treatments received at Xiaotangshan Hospital were analyzed retrospectively and were correlated to later status. Results Positive SARS-Co virus IgG antibody results were seen in 208 of 258 patients, with 21.3% (55 of 258 patients) still having a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco \u003C 80% of predicted). By comparing the 155 survivors with positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results and Dlco \u2265 80% predicted with the 50 patients with negative SARS-CoV IgG results, we found that 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality had endured a much longer course of fever and received larger doses of glucocorticoid, as well as higher ratios of oxygen inhalation and noninvasive ventilation treatment. For these patients, 51 of 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality underwent pulmonary function testing after approximately 1 month. Dlco improved in 80.4% of patients (41 of 51 patients). Of the patients with a lung diffusion abnormality, 40 of 51 patients showed lung fibrotic changes in the lung image examination and 22 patients (55%) showed improvement in lung fibrotic changes 1 month later. Conclusion These findings suggest that lung fibrotic changes caused by SARS disease occurred mostly in severely sick patients and may be self-rehabilitated. Dlco scores might be more sensitive than HRCT when evaluating lung fibrotic changes.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Lixin; Liu, Youning; Xiao, Yueyong; Tian, Qing; Fan, Baoxing; Zhao, Hong; Chen, Weijun","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71bfb9db381f9f7ca3ed5a6c29dca23e8250bbef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094359.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215498186; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215498186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HRCT"],"locations":["Xiaotangshan Hospital","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","sick patients","lung function","lung fibrotic changes","positive SARS-CoV IgG results","lung diffusion abnormality","positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results","negative SARS-CoV IgG results","SARS disease","lung image examination","IgG antibody testing","virus IgG antibody results","SARS-associated coronavirus","pulmonary diffusion abnormality","pulmonary function testing","Xiaotangshan Hospital","Dlco scores","lung radiographic pictures of severe acute respiratory syndrome","HRCT","Chinese PLA General Hospital","treatment strategy","later status","noninvasive ventilation treatment","examinations","chest radiography","higher ratios of oxygen inhalation","high-resolution CT","longer course of fever","larger doses of glucocorticoid","improvement","discharge","Beijing","follow-up","findings","survivors","Conclusion","Objectives","treatments","months","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Several multiplex molecular assays are costly. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens. METHODS: A GeXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay (GeXP assay) was developed to detect simultaneously sixteen different respiratory virus types/subtypes. Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were used to initiate the RT-PCR, and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the RT-PCR. The specificity of the GeXP assay was examined with positive controls for each virus type/subtype. The sensitivity was evaluated by performing the assay on serial ten-fold dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA of all RNA viruses and the plasmids containing the Adv and HBoV target sequence. GeXP assay was further evaluated using 126 clinical specimens and compared with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay. RESULTS: The GeXP assay achieved a sensitivity of 20\u2013200 copies for a single virus and 1000 copies when all of the 16 pre-mixed viral targets were present. Analyses of 126 clinical specimens using the GeXP assay demonstrated that GeXP assay and the RVP Fast assay were in complete agreement for 109/126 (88.51%) of the specimens. GeXP assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay for the detection of HRV and PIV3, and slightly less sensitive for the detection of HMPV, Adv, RSVB and HBoV. The whole process of the GeXP assay for the detection of 12 samples was completed within 2.5 hours. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the GeXP assay is a rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and high throughput method for the detection of respiratory virus infections.","publish_time":"2012-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jin; Mao, Nai-Ying; Zhang, Chen; Yang, Meng-Jie; Wang, Miao; Xu, Wen-Bo; Ma, Xue-Jun","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2857cb1d4c6c446ac30ab4d0cabca0b42d62c465.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3462154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891685/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex","HRV","HMPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GeXP assay","multiplex RT-PCR assay","Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay","detection of respiratory virus infections","detection of HMPV","detection of HRV","single virus","clinical specimens","sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens","different respiratory virus types","viral culture","Adv","limited sensitivity","copies","multiplex molecular assays","pre-mixed viral targets","transcribed RNA","RNA viruses","Existing standard non-molecular diagnostic methods","pair of universal primers","HBoV target sequence","sets of chimeric primers","high throughput method","DFA","positive controls","BACKGROUND","labor intensive","plasmids","fold dilutions of","subsequent cycles","development","subtypes","RSVB","complete agreement","serial","PIV3","samples","need","Analyses","CONCLUSIONS","specificity","process","RESULTS","hours"],"language":"en"},

Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yuxi; McKee, Martin; Torbica, Aleksandra; Stuckler, David","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7ea0d734c57e62efedbb1303153b539ad4aeeb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117034.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953619305465; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953619305465; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health-related misinformation","mechanism of misinformation","spread of health","rapid spread of misinformation date","social network analysis","content analysis","text analysis","health arena","published articles","potential drivers of health","network science","co-citation analysis","empirical articles","Studies","role of social media","Web of Science","current period","current evidence","Future research","effective care","interdisciplinary research","sensationalized news","role of belief systems","accurate scientific information","era of fake news","earliest days of scientific medicine","experiments","marketplace","Scopus","Google databases","psychology","greater collaboration","susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups","attention","internet","vaccination","nature","theoretical frameworks","powerful amplification","particular problems","instantaneous communication","cases","Abstract Contemporary commentators","Cochrane","systematic review","Ebola","intention","increasing trend","tailored interventions","disparate disciplinary paradigms","nutrition","cancer","fluoridation of water","Zika Virus","ideas","PubMed","fields","propagation","examples","quantum change","areas of life","lives of individuals","democracies","order","topics","total"],"language":"en"},

This review will evaluate studies that investigate how respiratory epithelial cells influence the behavior of immune cells and how epithelial cell/immune cell interactions contribute to antiviral responses and immunopathology outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Previous studies have characterized cytokine responses of virus-infected epithelial cells. More recent studies have carefully demonstrated the effects of these cytokines on cellular behaviors within the infected lung. Infected epithelial cells release exosomes that specifically regulate responses of monocytes and neighboring epithelial cells without promoting spread of virus. In contrast, rhinovirus-infected cells induce monocytes to upregulate expression of the viral receptor, promoting spread of the virus to alternate cell types. The precise alteration of PDL expression on infected epithelial cells has been shown to switch between inhibition and activation of antiviral responses. SUMMARY: These studies have more precisely defined the interactions between epithelial and immune cells during viral infections. This level of understanding is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that promote effective antiviral responses or epithelial repair, or inhibit damaging inflammatory responses during severe respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miura, Tanya A.","journal":"Current Clinical Microbiology Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba71e2e598bd8b6c3c9d825269600523afed2228.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6779166.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-019-0111-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected epithelial cells","respiratory epithelial cells","neighboring epithelial cells","epithelial repair","rhinovirus-infected cells","responses of monocytes","behavior of immune cells","effective antiviral responses","cytokine responses of virus","activation of antiviral responses","orchestrating effective anti-viral responses","damaging inflammatory responses","severe respiratory viral infections","viral receptor","infected lung","recent studies","immune cell interactions","spread of virus","Previous studies","cell types","RECENT FINDINGS","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","precise alteration of PDL expression","development of novel therapeutic strategies","Communication","cellular behaviors","effects","exosomes","cytokines","immunopathology outcomes","inhibition","contrast","level of understanding","excessive inflammation","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

We sequenced the full genome of 11 viruses of each pathotype and then focused on the single most distinctive site by additionally sequencing hundreds of viruses in that region. As a result, we identified 2 alternative amino acid differences in the putative fusion peptide of the spike protein that together distinguish FIPV from FECV in \u003E95% of cases.

We aimed to determine the association of the frequency of circulating TLR2\u002B/CD14\u002B monocytes (FTLR2%) with the outcomes of KD, as well as to compare FTLR2% to the usefulness of sIL-10. METHODS: The FTLR2% in patients with KD was measured by flow cytometry. Serum levels of IL-10 (sIL-10) were determined in 31 patients with KD before the initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and in 21 febrile controls by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were classified as having coronary artery lesions (CALs) based on the maximal internal diameters of the proximal right coronary artery and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery one month after the initial diagnosis. RESULTS: We found that FTLR2% greater than 92.62% predicted CALs with 80% sensitivity and 68.4% specificity, whereas FTLR2% more than 94.61% predicted IVIG resistance with 66.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Moreover, sIL-10 more than 15.52 pg/mL predicted CALs and IVIG resistance with 40% and 66.7% sensitivity, respectively, and 73.7% and 76.2% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: We showed that measuring FTLR2% before the initial treatment could be useful in predicting CAL development with better sensitivity than sIL-10 and with results comparable to sIL-10 results for the prediction of IVIG resistance in patients with KD. However, further studies are necessary to validate FTLR2% as a marker of prognosis and severity of KD.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Soo Jung; Kim, Nam Su","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bd481afbcdbbc5c78d67ed1f7204b09c1f83da1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5573743.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2017.60.7.208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28861111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD","IVIG","CAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FTLR2","patients","severity of KD","outcomes of KD","predicted IVIG resistance","predicted CALs","usefulness of sIL","specificity","prediction of IVIG resistance","initial treatment","better sensitivity","coronary artery lesions","proximal right coronary artery","circulating monocytes","initial diagnosis","results comparable","proximal left anterior descending coronary artery","frequency of circulating TLR2","Serum levels of IL","month","predicting CAL development","maximal internal diameters","present","CD14","Kawasaki disease","febrile controls","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","intravenous immunoglobulin","interleukin","receptor","marker of prognosis","production of proinflammatory cytokines","Activation of Toll","association","pg","flow cytometry","PURPOSE","studies","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

To show the important connection between human health and environmental quality, this study surveys the prevalence of sick building syndrome (SBS) among apartment residents and their evaluation of indoor environmental quality (IEQ). Based on a sample of 748 households living in Hong Kong, two interesting findings are revealed: (1) nasal discomfort was the commonest home-related SBS symptom despite the absence of any central ventilation system in apartment buildings; (2) noise, rather than ventilation, was the major IEQ problem perceived by residents. Our statistical analysis further showed that residents with SBS symptoms were less satisfied with their IEQ than those without. That is, despite a positive evaluation of specific IEQ criteria with respect to the building residents lived in, if they reported feeling SBS related symptoms, the overall IEQ evaluation of their building could still be negative. This perception bias gives rise to a sample selection problem in measuring perceived IEQ, which has implications on housing management practices and the formulation of a healthy housing policy.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Siu-Kei; Wai-Chung Lai, Lawrence; Ho, Daniel Chi-Wing; Chau, Kwong-Wing; Lo-Kuen Lam, Cindy; Hung-Fai Ng, Chris","journal":"Habitat International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6eb25ff60595fa82279c5d4886e2ec7fa0f67d72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124323.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2009.03.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397509000277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287695/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397509000277","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SBS"],"locations":["Asia","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["perceived IEQ","building residents","overall IEQ evaluation","apartment residents","SBS symptoms","major IEQ problem","SBS related symptoms","positive evaluation of specific IEQ criteria","evaluation of indoor environmental quality","commonest home-related SBS symptom","sample selection problem","health risk of living","apartment buildings","prevalence of sick building syndrome","human health","central ventilation system","housing management practices","healthy housing policy","formulation","absence","study","respect","rise","implications","Hong Kong","important connection","communicable disease","Asia","nasal discomfort","perception bias","high-density environment","interesting findings","SARS","households","noise","statistical analysis","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: Gastrointestinal endoscopes after reprocessing were selected randomly at the gastrointestinal endoscopy center of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai from October 2018 to February 2019. The endoscopes selected were all sampled in three different methods under continuous sampling and intermittent sampling respectively. Methods used includes, the biopsy channel group (Group A), the entire channel group (Group B), and the disc brush group (Group C). Then the colony forming units (CFU/piece) were counted in the laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 12 endoscopes were sampled by using continuous sampling approach, in which the detection rate of bacteria in disc brush group (33.3%) and entire channel group (33.3%) was higher than biopsy channel group (8.3%). Among the 12 endoscopes sampled with intermittent approach, the detection rate of bacteria from high to low was the disc brush group (50%), the entire channel group (41.7%), and the biopsy channel group (8.3%).

Its influence reaches all organs and cell types, representing an integral component of approximately 10% of the human proteome, and encompassing hundreds of key enzymes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency is strikingly common, affecting up to a quarter of the population in developing countries, but also affecting distinct populations in the developed world as a result of lifestyle, age, and disease-mediated factors. Consequently, zinc status is a critical factor that can influence antiviral immunity, particularly as zinc-deficient populations are often most at risk of acquiring viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes current basic science and clinical evidence examining zinc as a direct antiviral, as well as a stimulant of antiviral immunity. An abundance of evidence has accumulated over the past 50 y to demonstrate the antiviral activity of zinc against a variety of viruses, and via numerous mechanisms. The therapeutic use of zinc for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and the common cold has stemmed from these findings; however, there remains much to be learned regarding the antiviral mechanisms and clinical benefit of zinc supplementation as a preventative and therapeutic treatment for viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Read, Scott A; Obeid, Stephanie; Ahlenstiel, Chantelle; Ahlenstiel, Golo","journal":"Adv Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95d7d2dd0ee25084c9d6f284bd5cb3ae1065157c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6628855.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmz013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity of zinc","zinc status","Zinc deficiency","therapeutic use of zinc","zinc-deficient populations","antiviral mechanisms","viral infections","clinical benefit of zinc supplementation","direct antiviral","stimulant of antiviral immunity","clinical evidence","influence","therapeutic treatment","transcription factors","distinct populations","abundance of evidence","numerous mechanisms","herpes simplex virus","hepatitis C virus","disease-mediated factors","encompassing hundreds of key enzymes","current basic science","growth","cell types","age","developed world","HIV","critical factor","essential trace element","result of lifestyle","developing countries","variety of viruses","development","quarter","review","risk","human proteome","maintenance of immune function","integral component","organs","findings"],"language":"en"},

The nsp4 proteinase was expressed either fused to maltose binding protein or carrying a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Following purification, the nsp4 moiety of MBP-nsp4 was successfully used for structural studies [Barrette-Ng, I.H., Ng, K.K.S., Mark, B.L., van Aken, D., Cherney, M.M., Garen, C, Kolodenko, Y., Gorbalenya, A.E., Snijder, E.J., James, M.N.G, 2002.

Here, we report the identification and molecular characterization of a bat \u03B2-Coronavirus, detected during a viral survey carried out on different bat species in the island of Sardinia (Italy). Cutaneous, oral swabs, and faecal samples were collected from 46 bats, belonging to 15 different species, and tested for viral presence. Coronavirus RNA was detected in faecal samples from three different species: the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), and the European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis). Phylogenetic analyses based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences assigned the detected CoV to clade 2b within betacoronaviruses, clustering with SARS-like bat CoVs previously reported. These findings point to the need for continued surveillance of bat CoV circulating in Sardinian bats, and extend the current knowledge on CoV ecology with novel sequences detected in bat species not previously described as \u03B2-Coronavirus hosts.","publish_time":"2018-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lecis, Roberta; Mucedda, Mauro; Pidinchedda, Ermanno; Pittau, Marco; Alberti, Alberto","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c2448e0350eb05e795c985d2ba5cb164f8ed649.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089328.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426315/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-018-1614-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Sardinia"],"keyphrases":["different bat species","bat \u03B2-Coronavirus","bat populations","bat CoVs","detected CoV","continued surveillance of bat CoV","SARS-CoV","Coronavirus RNA","greater horseshoe bat","MERS-CoV","CoV ecology","different species","brown long-eared bat","European free-tailed bat","\u03B2-Coronavirus hosts","Sardinian bats","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","faecal samples","recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","novel sequences","viral survey","viral presence","importance of virus surveillance","large variety of emerging viruses","RdRp","Plecotus auritus","Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","clustering","current knowledge","clade","betacoronaviruses","need","natural reservoirs","Tadarida teniotis","mammalian coronaviruses","molecular characterization","island of Sardinia","oral swabs","humans","Phylogenetic analyses","identification","ancestry","evidence","Italy","findings"],"language":"en"},

Here, we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross\u2010species virus transmission in bats and rodents, another important host group. We show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network, suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species. We identify host traits associated with important reservoir species: gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network. We identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence.","publish_time":"2015-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luis, Angela D.; O\u0027Shea, Thomas J.; Hayman, David T.

Over the past decade, investigations into the mechanisms underlying these antiviral responses have focused extensively on immune surveillance sensors that recognize virus\u2010derived components (such as lipids, sugars and nucleic acids). The findings of these studies have suggested that antiviral responses are mediated by cytosolic or intracellular compartment sensors and their adaptor molecules (e.g., TLR, myeloid differentiation primary response 88, retinoic acid inducible gene\u2010I, IFN\u2010\u03B2 promoter stimulator\u20101, cyclic GMP\u2010AMP synthase and stimulator of IFN genes axis) for the primary sensing of virus\u2010derived nucleic acids, leading to production of type I IFNs, pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the host cells. Thus, host cells have evolved an elaborate host defense machinery to recognize and eliminate virus infections. In turn, to achieve sustained viral infection and induce pathogenesis, viruses have also evolved several counteracting strategies for achieving immune escape by targeting immune sensors, adaptor molecules, intracellular kinases and transcription factors. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries concerning the role of the cytosolic nucleic acid\u2010sensing immune response in viral recognition and control of viral infection. In addition, we consider the regulatory machinery of the cytosolic nucleic acid\u2010sensing immune response because these immune surveillance systems must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant immune responses to self and non\u2010self\u2010nucleic acids.","publish_time":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abe, Takayuki; Marutani, Yuki; Shoji, Ikuo","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7a8cdd3adbfdd90be7344af72f3e8531dd0842f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677166/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12669","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune sensors","immune escape","immune surveillance sensors","aberrant immune responses","cytosolic nucleic acid","host cells","immune surveillance systems","derived nucleic acids","innate antiviral responses","primary sensing of virus","non\u2010self\u2010nucleic acids","adaptor molecules","intracellular compartment sensors","viral recognition","control of viral infection","sustained viral infection","elaborate host defense machinery","virus infections","myeloid differentiation primary response","retinoic acid inducible gene","intracellular kinases","stimulator of IFN genes axis","DNA viruses","derived components","regulatory machinery","\u03B2 promoter stimulator","cyclic GMP","AMP synthase","pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines","IFNs","production of type","chemokines","TLR","kinds of RNA","mechanisms","lipids","role","transcription factors","investigations","counteracting strategies","pathogenesis","sugars","recent discoveries","past decade","turn","studies","review","addition","findings"],"language":"en"},

In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named COVID-19) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve health activity during pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Indini, Alice; Aschele, Carlo; Bruno, Daniele; Cavanna, Luigi; Clerico, Mario; Fiorentini, Giammaria; Fioretto, Luisa; Giordano, Monica; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Ortega, Cinzia; Pinotti, Graziella; Scanni, Alberto; Zamagni, Claudio; Blasi, Livio; Grossi, Francesco","journal":"Eur J Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7136865.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["risk of COVID","national survey","impact of COVID","triage of patients","health activity","oncologic patients","Italian oncology departments","implementation of containment measures of COVID","CIPOMO","Italy","national territory","national basis","pandemic","Results","Italian association of head physicians","public health services","global health problem","clinical activity of oncologists","following measures","novel disease entity","well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici","hospital","potential harm","important starting point","benefit","significant hurdle","delay of non-urgent visits","affected nations","proactive approach","International cooperation","SARSCoV","protective devices","homogeneous distribution","research activities","China","example","actual emergency","epidemic","continuum of care","ways","diffusion","end of year","country","telemedicine","midst","Europe","infection"],"language":"en"},

The guidelines were drafted with the assistance of a working group of experts in infectious diseases, transplantation, and public health. For the purposes of this report, HSCT is defined as any transplantation of blood-or marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, regardless of transplant type (i.e., allogeneic or autologous) or cell source (i.e., bone marrow, peripheral blood, or placental or umbilical cord blood). Such OIs as bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and helminth infections occur with increased frequency or severity among HSCT recipients. These evidence-based guidelines contain information regarding preventing OIs, hospital infection control, strategies for safe living after transplantation, vaccinations, and hematopoietic stem cell safety. The disease-specific sections address preventing exposure and disease for pediatric and adult and autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. The goal of these guidelines is twofold: to summarize current data and provide evidence-based recommendations regarding preventing OIs among HSCT patients. The guidelines were developed for use by HSCT recipients, their household and close contacts, transplant and infectious diseases physicians, HSCT center personnel, and public health professionals. For all recommendations, prevention strategies are rated by the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation. Adhering to these guidelines should reduce the number and severity of OIs among HSCT recipients.

In this study, we have characterized the mechanism of membrane interaction of a short, 9-residue peptide TK9 (T(55)VYVYSRVK(63)) that had been derived from the carboxyl terminal of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) corona virus (SARS CoV) envelope (E) protein. The peptide has been studied for its physical changes in the presence of both zwitterionic DPC and negatively charged SDS model membrane micelles, respectively, with the help of a battery of biophysical techniques including two-dimensional solution state NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, in both micellar environments, TK9 adopted an alpha helical conformation; however, the helical propensities were much higher in the case of DPC compared to those of SDS micelle, suggesting that TK9 has more specificity towards eukaryotic cell membrane than the bacterial cell membrane. The orientation of the peptide TK9 also varies in the different micellar environments.

However field evidences are rare, mainly obtained from large-scale sampling and typically represented by single sequences rather than by groups of circulating \u201Crecombinant progenies\u201D. The present work was aimed to investigate the gray area between experimental studies and large-scale epidemiological investigations. The study was performed on ORF5, ORF7 and concatenated sequences obtained in our laboratory or available in GenBank collected between 2009 and 2012 in northern Italy. Six independent recombinant strains out of 66 concatenated sequences (\u223C9%) were found, demonstrating a high recombination frequency respect to previous field studies but comparable to in vitro experiments. In silico analysis let speculate that this new strain displayed physicochemical features diverse enough to potentially alter its immunological properties. Taken altogether, the results of our study support previous experimental evidences that depict PRRSV to be extremely prone to recombination. The limited temporal and geographical spread of recombinant strains however states in favor of a limited fitness of the recombinant progeny compared to parental strains and the marginal role of this phenomenon in PRRSV evolution.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franzo, Giovanni; Cecchinato, Mattia; Martini, Marco; Ceglie, Letizia; Gigli, Alessandra; Drigo, Michele","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d29874a6a6aaca3dd240c945e14ef795815634e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127771.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003335; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150757/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.08.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["independent recombinant strains","experimental studies","recombinant progeny","recombinant progenies","PRRSV evolution","Abstract Recombination","concatenated sequences","previous experimental evidences","geographical spread of recombinant strains","high recombination frequency respect","previous field studies","parental strains","single sequences","experimental conditions","field evidences","study","limited fitness","limited temporal","large-scale sampling","marginal role","viral evolution","large-scale epidemiological investigations","well-documented phenomenon","states","Respiratory Syndrome Virus","new strain","gray area","favor","groups of circulating","physicochemical features diverse","laboratory","ORF5","ORF7","experiments","results","silico analysis","GenBank","immunological properties","present work","northern Italy","authors"],"language":"en"},

We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs. These sequence studies suggested that the MHV gene 1 product is involved in RNA synthesis, and that this product is processed autoproteolytically after translation. This study completes the sequence of the MHV genome, which is 31 kb long, and constitutes the largest viral RNA known.","publish_time":"1991-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Han-Jung; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Koonin, Eugene V.; La Monica, Nicola; Tuler, Jeremy; Bagdzhadzhyan, Anush; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d08b0acba6b0466f5713034bd19745c9a79b124.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190071I; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190071I","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequence of ORF","MHV gene","corresponding ORF of IBV","protease domains","RNA synthesis","sequence studies","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA of avian coronavirus","largest viral RNA","functional domains","complete sequence","pseudoknot RNA structure","corresponding region","overlapping region","amino acids","MHV genome","amino acid sequence analysis","membrane-anchoring domains","cysteine-rich domains","large open reading frames","polyprotein","nucleotides","translation studies","contrast","genome of murine coronavirus","mouse hepatitis virus","infectious bronchitis virus","helicase","JHM strain","cDNA cloning","sequencing","papain","predicted molecular weight","zinc-finger motifs","size","ribosomal frameshifting mechanism","picornaviral","transcription","high degree of divergence","total length","multiple protein products","viruses","presence","study","ORFs"],"language":"en"},

We present an approach to study variation in mosquito distribution and concomitant viral infections on the landscape level. In a pilot study we analyzed mosquito distribution along a 10-km transect of a West African rainforest area, which included primary forest, secondary forest, plantations, and human settlements. Variation was observed in the abundance of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, and Uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types. Screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, as well as an unclassified virus. Polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat. Based on these initial analyses, we believe that further work is indicated to investigate the impact of anthropogenic landscape changes on mosquito distribution and accompanying arbovirus infection.","publish_time":"2009-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Junglen, S.; Kurth, A.; Kuehl, H.; Quan, P.-L.; Ellerbrok, H.; Pauli, G.; Nitsche, A.; Nunn, C.; Rich, S.

Inflammatory responses have a significant impact on MERS-CoV pathogenesis and disease outcome. However, CD4\u002B T-cell induced immune responses during acute MERS-CoV infection are barely detectable, with potent inhibition of effector T cells and downregulation of antigen presentation. The local pulmonary immune response, particularly the Th1 and Th2-related immune response during acute severe MERS-CoV infection is not fully understood. In this study, we offer the first insights into the pulmonary gene expression profile of Th1 and Th2-related cytokines/chemokines (Th1 \u0026 Th2 responses) during acute MERS-CoV infection using RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays. We also quantified the expression level of primary inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Our results showed a downregulation of Th2, inadequate (partial) Th1 immune response and high expression levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03B1 and IL-1\u03B2 and the neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8) in the lower respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected patients. Moreover, we identified a high viral load in all included patients. We also observed a correlation between inflammatory cytokines, Th1, and Th2 downregulation and the case fatality rate. Th1 and Th2 response downregulation, high expression of inflammatory cytokines, and high viral load may contribute to lung inflammation, severe infection, the evolution of pneumonia and ARDS, and a higher case fatality rate. Further study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the Th1 and Th2 regulatory pathways will be vital for active vaccine development and the identification of novel therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alosaimi, Bandar; Hamed, Maaweya E.; Naeem, Asif; Alsharef, Ali A.; AlQahtani, Saeed Y.; AlDosari, Kamel M.; Alamri, Aref A.; Al-Eisa, Kholoud; Khojah, Taghreed; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Enani, Mushira A.","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/319663b2ac3cd9beb28724b6a3f4e2e6b0c2c59a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128721.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31706200/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466619303242; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466619303242","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR Arrays","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["downregulation of Th2","Th2 downregulation","Th1 immune response","Th2 response downregulation","Th2 responses","acute MERS-CoV infection","high expression of inflammatory cytokines","Th2-related cytokines","MERS-CoV pathogenesis","Abstract MERS-CoV","Th2-related immune response","acute severe MERS-CoV infection","Inflammatory responses","high expression levels of inflammatory cytokines IL","immune responses","expression level of primary inflammatory cytokines","Th2 regulatory pathways","pulmonary gene expression profile of Th1","severe infection","high morbidity","high viral load","CoV infected patients","local pulmonary immune response","lower respiratory tract of MERS","higher case fatality rate","downregulation of antigen presentation","chemokines","study","T-cell","neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine IL","included patients","potent inhibition of effector T cells","active vaccine development","CXCL8","lung inflammation","significant impact","RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays","evolution of pneumonia","ARDS","insights","identification of novel therapeutic strategies","molecular mechanisms","humans","disease outcome","pathogenic virus","CD4","correlation","results"],"language":"en"},

In a substantial number of cases the causative agent remains undetected. Since August 2014, an increase in Enterovirus(EV)\u2010D68 infections was reported. We aimed to investigate epidemiology and clinical relevance of EV\u2010D68. From June to December 2014 and from September to December 2015, 803 and 847 respiratory specimens, respectively, were tested for respiratory viruses with a multiplex RT\u2010PCR. This multiplex RT\u2010PCR does not detect EV\u2010D68. Therefore, 457 (2014) and 343 (2015) specimens with negative results were submitted to an EV\u2010specific\u2010RT\u2010PCR. EV\u2010positive specimens were tested with an EV\u2010D68\u2010specific\u2010RT\u2010PCR and genotyped. Eleven specimens of 2014 tested positive in the EV\u2010specific\u2010RT\u2010PCR and of these seven were positive in the EV\u2010D68\u2010specific\u2010RT\u2010PCR. Typing confirmed these as EV\u2010D68. Median age of EV\u2010D68\u2010positive patients was 3 years (1 month\u201091 years). Common symptoms included fever (n = 6, 86%), respiratory distress (n = 5, 71%), and cough (n = 4, 57%). All EV\u2010D68\u2010positive patients were admitted to hospital, 4 (57%) were admitted to intensive care units and 6 (86%) received oxygen. One patient suffered from acute flaccid paralysis.

A close association between migration and hibernation exists in temperate, but not in tropical, bats.

Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fleming, T.

After autoproteolytic cleavage, the CHIKV capsid protein (CP) is involved in RNA binding and assembly of the viral particle. The monomeric CP is approximately 30 kDa in size and is small enough for passive transport through nuclear pores. Some alphaviruses are found to harbor nuclear localization signals (NLS) and transport of these proteins between cellular compartments was shown to be energy dependent. The active nuclear import of cytoplasmic proteins is mediated by karyopherins and their export by exportins. As nuclear and cytoplasmic trafficking may play a role in the life cycle of CHIKV, we have sought to identify nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in CHIKV CP in a virus-free system. METHODS: EGFP-fusion proteins of CHIKV CP and mutants thereof were created and used to monitor their intracellular localization. Binding of cellular proteins was confirmed in pull-down assays with purified CP using co-immuoprecipitation. Nuclear localization was demonstrated in a virus-free system using fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Here we show that CHIKV CP is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein with an active NLS that binds to karyopherin \u03B1 (Kar\u03B1) for its nuclear translocation. We also found that the Kar\u03B14 C-terminal NLS binding site is sufficient for this interaction. We further demonstrate that CHIKV CP interacts directly with the export receptor CRM1 to transport this viral protein out of the nucleus via a nuclear export signal (NES). The CHIKV CP NES was mapped between amino acids 143 and 155 of CP. Deduced from in silico analyses we found that the NES has a mode of binding similar to the snurportin-1 CRM1 complex. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show that in a virus-free system that the CHIKV capsid protein contains both, a NLS and a NES, and that it is actively transported between the cytoplasma and the nucleus. We conclude that CHIKV CP has the ability to shuttle via interaction with karyopherins for its nuclear import and, vice versa, by CRM1-dependent nuclear export.","publish_time":"2013-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Saijo; Rai, Jagdish; John, Lijo; Schaefer, Stephan; P\u00FCtzer, Brigitte M; Herchenr\u00F6der, Ottmar","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cee73a9e8367f60e1149b8db0b8a00a780c84d9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3765696.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23984714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV CP","CP","NLS","CHIKV CP NES","NES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV CP NES","nuclear pores","nuclear translocation","nuclear export signals","nuclear localization signals","CRM1-dependent nuclear export","CHIKV capsid protein","purified CP","EGFP-fusion proteins of CHIKV CP","nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein","monomeric CP","active nuclear import of cytoplasmic proteins","life cycle of CHIKV","Binding of cellular proteins","virus-free system","active NLS","viral protein","export receptor CRM1","RNA binding","Chikungunya virus","intracellular localization","Kar\u03B14 C-terminal NLS binding site","mode of binding similar","cytoplasmic trafficking","karyopherins","passive transport","interaction","nucleus","CRM1 complex","cellular compartments","viral particle","energy dependent","pull-down assays","snurportin","role","co-immuoprecipitation","karyopherin \u03B1","kDa","size","assembly","fluorescence microscopy","autoproteolytic cleavage","ability","mutants","amino acids","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Togaviridae family","cytoplasma","exportins","alphaviruses","CONCLUSIONS","silico","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

These two diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age. Vitamin D is believed to have immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems by modulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides, like cathelicidin, in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli. The aim of this review is to summarize the more recently published data with regard to potential associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with infectious respiratory tract diseases of childhood and the possible health benefits from vitamin D supplementation. METHODS: The literature search was conducted by using the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, with the following keywords: vitamin D, respiratory tract infection, tuberculosis, influenza, infancy, and childhood. RESULTS: Several studies have identified links between inadequate 25(OH)D concentrations and the development of upper or lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. Some of them also suggest that intervention with vitamin D supplements could decrease both child morbidity and mortality from such causes. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies agree in that decreased vitamin D concentrations are prevalent among most infants and children with RTIs. Also, normal to high-serum 25(OH)D appears to have some beneficial influence on the incidence and severity of some, but not all, types of these infections. However, studies with vitamin D supplementation revealed conflicting results as to whether supplementation may be of benefit, and at what doses.","publish_time":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zisi, Dimitra; Challa, Anna; Makis, Alexandros","journal":"Hormones (Athens)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a7cc41565f6936fa5fe1456b07f2ae8e56b36aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092025.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42000-019-00155-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768940/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vitamin D supplementation","vitamin D concentrations","vitamin D supplements","hydroxyvitamin D","lower respiratory tract infections","OH","studies","infectious respiratory tract diseases of childhood","infants","young children","mortality","RTIs","leading causes of morbidity","child morbidity","conflicting results","common cause of hospitalization","major cause of illness","following keywords","possible health benefits","development of upper","potential associations","influenza","tuberculosis","adaptive immune systems","Google Scholar databases","response","cathelicidin","immunomodulatory effects","expression of antimicrobial peptides","PubMed","Scopus","published data","regard","pneumonia","infancy","beneficial influence","links","PURPOSE","high-serum","bacterial stimuli","incidence","severity","bronchiolitis","intervention","literature search","years of age","METHODS","aim","review","doses","CONCLUSIONS","types"],"language":"en"},

The SARS issue and a recent outbreak of measles in New York City (NYC) highlighted the need for EDs to have effective measures to rapidly triage and isolate patients with potentially communicable illnesses. PROJECT: A multidisciplinary team at a NYC hospital developed a screening and isolation protocol in collaboration with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Education and training was provided through classroom instruction using a train the trainer format. This training included a power point presentation along with interactive case scenarios. Pre and post tests, and a series of unannounced drills were used to evaluate the process. RESULTS: Ninety percent of registered nurses, 67% of emergency medical physicians, 82% of emergency service assistants, 63% of patient access workers and 73% of social workers in the ED were in-serviced. Patient access workers failed to follow the quick registration process for patients presenting with a cough. The triage nurse was able to isolate the patient based on symptoms and travel history, and knew the appropriate mask to be worn by the patient versus the medical staff. However, basic infection control including hand hygiene was not consistently practiced. Personal Protective Equipment was not readily available in the triage area. LESSONS LEARNED: Although a large proportion of the ED staff received training, breaches in basic infection control were observed. Consistency of educational in-service was difficult to assure using the train the trainer format. Increased involvement of Infection Control Professionals is needed to help translate education into practice, and to improve compliance with procedures.","publish_time":"2006-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hardy, S.; Contreras, G.; Weber, K.; Rothberg, R.; Wetherbee, R.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655306007188; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655306007188","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SARS","NYC","NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene","Infection Control Professionals"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolation of patients","training","patient access workers","isolate patients","basic infection control","ED staff","medical staff","NYC hospital","SARS issue","social workers","trainer format","triage nurse","triage area","Increased involvement of Infection Control Professionals","NYC Department of Health","emergency medical physicians","isolation protocol","Mental Hygiene","hand hygiene","communicable diseases","communicable illnesses","recent outbreak of measles","emergency service assistants","quick registration process","outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","collaboration","New York City","breaches","power point presentation","need","screening","classroom instruction","interactive case scenarios","importance of rapid recognition","travel history","effective measures","large proportion","percent of registered nurses","multidisciplinary team","EDs","nosocominal","post tests","series of unannounced drills","Consistency of educational in-service","Personal Protective Equipment","RESULTS","appropriate mask","symptoms","compliance","PROJECT","LESSONS","practice","cough","visitors","procedures"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated online search behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitudes of \u201Cinfodemic monikers\u201D (ie, erroneous information that gives rise to interpretative mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, etc) circulating in Italy. METHODS: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average peak comparison (APC) values were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: Keywords such as \u201Cnovel coronavirus,\u201D \u201CChina coronavirus,\u201D \u201CCOVID-19,\u201D \u201C2019-nCOV,\u201D and \u201CSARS-COV-2\u201D were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 terms trending in Italy.

Misinformation was widely circulated in the Campania region, and racism-related information was widespread in Umbria and Basilicata. These monikers were frequently searched (APC weighted total \u003E100) in more than 10 major cities in Italy, including Rome. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a growing regional and population-level interest in COVID-19 in Italy. The majority of searches were related to amuchina, face masks, health bulletins, and COVID-19 symptoms. Since a large number of infodemic monikers were observed across Italy, we recommend that health agencies use Google Trends to predict human behavior as well as to manage misinformation circulation in Italy.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rovetta, Alessandro; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32338613/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19374","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APC","Google"],"locations":["Umbria","Campania","Rome"],"keyphrases":["Italy","attitudes of infodemic monikers","scientific COVID","racism-related information","high number of infodemic monikers","large number of infodemic monikers","health bulletins","novel coronavirus disease","health agencies","China coronavirus","APC weighted total","public health communication","fake news","Search volume values","erroneous information","Google Trends","misleading information","amuchina","outbreak","online search behavior","face masks","Basilicata","regions of Umbria","symptoms","results","internet search activity","episodes of racism","various regions","human behavior","major cities","majority of searches","misinformation circulation","average peak comparison","interpretative mistakes","rise","read newspapers","terms trending","population-level","beginning","Campania region","government websites","article titles","OBJECTIVE","Rome","vaccines","Keywords","CONCLUSIONS","disinfectant","METHODS","SARS-COV","nCOV","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

These findings were earlier and more severe in the co-infected group, indicating that the concomitance of BVDV and BHV-1 in the lungs disrupts the pulmonary homeostasis by facilitating the establishment of an inflammatory and procoagulant environment modulated by inflammatory mediators released by pulmonary M\u03A6s. In this regard, the co-infected calves, in spite of presenting a greater number of IM\u03A6s than single-infected group, show a significant decrease in iNOS expression coinciding with the presence of more coagulation lesions. Moreover, animals pre-inoculated with BVDV displayed an alteration in the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03B1 and IL-1), which play a key role in activating the immune response, as well as in the local cell-mediated response.","publish_time":"2013-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Risalde, Mar\u00EDa A; Molina, Ver\u00F3nica; S\u00E1nchez-Cord\u00F3n, Pedro J; Romero-Palomo, Fernando; Pedrera, Miriam; Garfia, Bartolom\u00E9; G\u00F3mez-Villamandos, Jos\u00E9 C","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c296f6a98b4eb94a69e4caef2df38ccf6e498511.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3618313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23506546/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-20","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["co-infected calves","pulmonary M\u03A6s","pulmonary lesions","co-infected group","lungs of calves","BHV","single-infected group","inflammatory mediators","groups of calves","role of M\u03A6s","pulmonary homeostasis","response of pro-inflammatory cytokines","induction of inflammatory responses","IL","TNF\u03B1","concomitance of BVDV","immune response","coagulation lesions","altered function of pulmonary macrophages","development of pathological lesions","animals pre-inoculated","vascular changes","mechanisms responsible","healthy animals","local cell-mediated response","key role","important vascular alterations","host defense mechanisms","iNOS expression coinciding","bovine herpesvirus type","bovine viral diarrhea virus","fibrin microthrombi","cattle","significant decrease","platelet aggregations","respiratory disease","pathogens","presence","establishment","procoagulant environment","spite","greater number of IM\u03A6s","lung injury","Factor","immunohistochemical","MAC387","blood vessels","sepsis","Resistance","study","COX","organ","regard","ultrastructural studies","sophisticated strategies","purpose","aim","findings"],"language":"en"},

Since 2010, livestock farmers increasingly use biochar as a regular feed supplement to improve animal health, increase nutrient intake efficiency and thus productivity. As biochar gets enriched with nitrogen-rich organic compounds during the digestion process, the excreted biochar-manure becomes a more valuable organic fertilizer causing lower nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions during storage and soil application. Scientists only recently started to investigate the mechanisms of biochar in the different stages of animal digestion and thus most published results on biochar feeding are based so far on empirical studies. This review summarizes the state of knowledge up to the year 2019 by evaluating 112 relevant scientific publications on the topic to derive initial insights, discuss potential mechanisms behind observations and identify important knowledge gaps and future research needs. The literature analysis shows that in most studies and for all investigated farm animal species, positive effects on different parameters such as toxin adsorption, digestion, blood values, feed efficiency, meat quality and/or greenhouse gas emissions could be found when biochar was added to feed. A considerable number of studies provided statistically non-significant results, though tendencies were mostly positive. Rare negative effects were identified in regard to the immobilization of liposoluble feed ingredients (e.g., vitamin E or Carotenoids) which may limit long-term biochar feeding. We found that most of the studies did not systematically investigate biochar properties (which may vastly differ) and dosage, which is a major drawback for generalizing results. Our review demonstrates that the use of biochar as a feed additive has the potential to improve animal health, feed efficiency and livestock housing climate, to reduce nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions, and to increase the soil organic matter content and thus soil fertility when eventually applied to soil. In combination with other good practices, co-feeding of biochar may thus have the potential to improve the sustainability of animal husbandry. However, more systematic multi-disciplinary research is definitely needed to arrive at generalizable recommendations.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmidt, Hans-Peter; Hagemann, Nikolas; Draper, Kathleen; Kammann, Claudia","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24a8a71cbe308f92fd40a91b81fd4483363bd36b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6679646.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396445/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7373","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biochar feeding","mechanisms of biochar","use of biochar","long-term biochar","biochar properties","co-feeding of biochar","feed efficiency","excreted biochar-manure","animal health","feed additive","greenhouse gas emissions","different stages of animal digestion","regular feed supplement","soil fertility","potential mechanisms","soil application","empirical studies","nutrient intake efficiency","sustainability of animal husbandry","soil organic matter content","immobilization of liposoluble feed ingredients","lower nutrient losses","digestion process","investigated farm animal species","positive effects","published results","generalizing results","considerable number of studies","review","valuable organic fertilizer","non-significant results","different parameters","nitrogen-rich organic compounds","state of knowledge","livestock farmers","important knowledge gaps","livestock housing climate","future research needs","Rare negative effects","systematic multi-disciplinary research","blood values","meat quality","toxin adsorption","regard","observations","storage","topic","initial insights","good practices","vitamin E","acute medical treatment of animals","charcoal","relevant scientific publications","year","major drawback","tendencies","Carotenoids","carbonized biomass similar","centuries","combination","productivity","dosage","literature analysis","generalizable recommendations","Scientists"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies had identified the genes encoding most of the enzymes responsible for the generation of ceramide and ongoing research is aimed at characterizing their individual functions in cellular response to stress. This chapter discusses the seminal and more recent discoveries in regards to the pathways responsible for the accumulation of ceramide during stress and the mechanisms by which ceramide affects cell functions. The former group includes the roles of neutral sphingomyelinase 2, serine palmitoyltransferase, ceramide synthases, as well as the secretory and endosomal/lysosomal forms of acid sphingomyelinase. The latter summarizes the mechanisms by which ceramide activate its direct targets, PKC?, PP2A and cathepsin D. The ability of ceramide to affect membrane organization is discussed in the light of its relevance to cell signaling. Emerging evidence to support the previously assumed notion that ceramide acts in a strictly structure-specific manner are also included. These findings are described in the context of several physiological and pathophysiological conditions, namely septic shock, obesity-induced insulin resistance, aging and apoptosis of tumor cells in response to radiation and chemotherapy.","publish_time":"2010-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikolova-Karakashian, Mariana N.; Rozenova, Krassimira A.","journal":"Sphingolipids as Signaling and Regulatory Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11cbdd4c1c43fe5443920f7c35dc13496cff6bca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzcyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ceramide synthases","ceramide acts","ability of ceramide","generation of ceramide","resulting accumulation of ceramide","mechanisms","cell functions","tumor necrosis","cellular responses","pathways responsible","enzymes responsible","recent discoveries","individual functions","Recent studies","Emerging evidence","apoptosis of tumor cells","roles of neutral sphingomyelinase","lysosomal forms of acid sphingomyelinase","septic shock","serum deprivation","obesity-induced insulin resistance","lipopolysaccharide","pathophysiological conditions","serine palmitoyltransferase","PP2A","irradiation","interleukin","regards","PKC","stressors","various antitumor treatments","direct targets","assumed notion","context","light","genes","membrane organization","cathepsin","ongoing research","structure-specific manner","group","chemotherapy","activation of sphingomyelinases","relevance","chapter","findings"],"language":"en"},

Thankfully this outbreak was much less severe than that associated with Spanish flu in 1918. We describe the viral factors that affect virulence of influenza and speculate on the future course of this virus in humans and animals.","publish_time":"2011-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elderfield, Ruth; Barclay, Wendy","journal":"Hot Topics in Infection and Immunity in Children VIII","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60903aca31c440f4abfc8c9a37094b9cf5aea575.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzczMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic virus","new influenza virus","recent H1N1 pandemic","virulence of influenza","use of vaccines","humans","human population","future course","antiviral drugs","viral factors","globe","century pandemics","Spanish flu","animals","origins","outbreak","impact"],"language":"en"},

Diverse exposure circumstances, varied clinical presentations, unique patient-specific factors, and inconsistent diagnostic and therapeutic infrastructure support, coupled with relatively few definitive antidotes, may complicate evaluation and management. The historical approach to poisoned patients (patient arousal, toxin elimination, and toxin identification) has given way to rigorous attention to the fundamental aspects of basic life suppport \u2014 airway management, oxygenation and ventilation, circulatory competence, thermoregulation, and substrate availability. Selected patients may benefit from methods to alter toxin pharmacokinetics to minimize systemic, target organ, or tissue compartment exposure (either by decreasing absorption or increasing elimination). These may include syrup of ipecac, orogastric lavage, activated single- or multi-dose charcoal, whole bowel irrigation, endoscopy and surgery, urinary alkalinization, saline diuresis, or extracorporeal methods (hemodialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, continuous venovenous hemofiltration, and exchange transfusion). Pharmaceutical adjuncts and antidotes may be useful in toxicant-induced hyperthermias. In the context of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticholinergic, anticonvulsant, antihyperglycemic, antimicrobial, antineoplastic, cardiovascular, opioid, or sedative-hypnotic agents overdose, N-acetylcysteine, physostigmine, l-carnitine, dextrose, octreotide, pyridoxine, dexrazoxane, leucovorin, glucarpidase, atropine, calcium, digoxin-specific antibody fragments, glucagon, high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy, lipid emulsion, magnesium, sodium bicarbonate, naloxone, and flumazenil are specifically reviewed. In summary, patients generally benefit from aggressive support of vital functions, careful history and physical examination, specific laboratory analyses, a thoughtful consideration of the risks and benefits of decontamination and enhanced elimination, and the use of specific antidotes where warranted. Data supporting antidotes effectiveness vary considerably. Clinicians are encouraged to utilize consultation with regional poison centers or those with toxicology training to assist with diagnosis, management, and administration of antidotes, particularly in unfamiliar cases.","publish_time":"2010-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Silas W.","journal":"Molecular, Clinical and Environmental Toxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad3731bd5875be4ce775894fd578c85ad9a8fe7b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123602/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of specific antidotes","toxin elimination","poisoned patients","administration of antidotes","definitive antidotes","antidotes effectiveness","treatment of patients","Selected patients","specific laboratory analyses","unique patient-specific factors","toxin pharmacokinetics","toxin identification","airway management","enhanced elimination","digoxin-specific antibody fragments","multi-dose charcoal","charcoal hemoperfusion","patient arousal","extracorporeal methods","therapeutic infrastructure support","tissue compartment exposure","Diverse exposure circumstances","aggressive support of vital functions","high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy","lipid emulsion","careful history","glucagon","physical examination","clinical presentations","surgery","magnesium","fundamental aspects of basic life suppport","oxygenation","calcium","hemodialysis","continuous venovenous hemofiltration","saline diuresis","target organ","bowel irrigation","inconsistent diagnostic","anticholinergic","anticonvulsant","antihyperglycemic","pyridoxine","opioid","N-acetylcysteine","dexrazoxane","sedative-hypnotic agents overdose","sodium bicarbonate","leucovorin","glucarpidase","urinary alkalinization","circulatory competence","endoscopy","ventilation","thoughtful consideration","atropine","anti-inflammatory","thermoregulation","carnitine","dextrose","physostigmine","octreotide","risks","rigorous attention","toxicology training","benefits of decontamination","regional poison centers","orogastric lavage","historical approach","consultation","naloxone"],"language":"en"},

Here, in a first step to study this problem theoretically, we analyze mutating pathogens spreading on simple SIR networks with grid-like connectivity. We have in mind the spatial aspect of epidemics, which often advance on transport links between hosts or groups of hosts such as cities or countries. We focus on the case of mutations that enhance an agent\u2019s infection rate. We uncover that the small-world property, i.e., the presence of long-range connections, makes the network very vulnerable, supporting frequent supercritical mutations and bringing the network from disease extinction to full blown epidemic. For very large numbers of long-range links, however, the effect reverses and we find a reduced chance for large outbreaks. We study two cases, one with discrete number of mutational steps and one with a continuous genetic variable, and we analyze various scaling regimes. For the continuous case we derive a Fokker-Planck-like equation for the probability density and solve it for small numbers of shortcuts using the WKB approximation. Our analysis supports the claims that a potentiating mutation in the transmissibility might occur during an epidemic wave and not necessarily before its initiation.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00FCdiger, Sten; Plietzsch, Anton; Sagu\u00E9s, Francesc; Sokolov, Igor M.; Kurths, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3afe63d6233d0ab45177d612675e889001d7b543.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125191.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WKB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["large numbers of long-range links","case of mutations","continuous case","small numbers of shortcuts","mutating pathogens","groups of hosts","transport links","blown epidemic","large outbreaks","epidemic wave","frequent supercritical mutations","presence of long-range connections","continuous genetic variable","small-world property","spatial aspect of epidemics","simple SIR networks","reduced chance","disease extinction","discrete number of mutational steps","equation","grid","transmissibility","Fokker-Planck","probability density","effect reverses","potentiating mutation","similar timescales","WKB approximation","agent\u2019s infection rate","claims","various scaling regimes","connectivity","mind","problem","cities","evolution","analysis","dynamics","cases","countries","initiation"],"language":"en"},

The CCV strains were: two ATCC reference strains, the Insavc-1 vaccine strain, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA) challenge strain, and two California field isolates (UCD-1 and UCD-2) from the 1970s. All six strains, downstream of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene, had sufficient size for an ORF 7b, and thus, none were transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-like since TGEV lacks ORF 7b. By sequence analysis of the variable domain at the 5\u2032 end of the S gene, five of the six CCV strains had a high degree of identity with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). However, one CCV field isolate (UCD-1) was different and had a high degree of identity with the 5\u2032 end of the TGEV S gene. This suggests that RNA recombination occurred at this site between antigenically related coronaviruses. The low passage field isolates, UCD-1 and UCD-2, varied in their initial infectivity for swine testicular cells suggesting that sequence differences in the variable domain of the S gene may account for biological variation among CCVs.","publish_time":"1999-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wesley, Ronald D","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCV","National Veterinary Services Laboratories","ORF","TGEV","TGEV S","RNA"],"locations":["California"],"keyphrases":["UCD","CCV strains","TGEV S gene","protein gene","CCV field isolate","variable domain","ATCC reference strains","high degree of identity","variable region","California field isolates","end","ORF","low passage field isolates","challenge strain","vaccine strain","sequence differences","sequence analysis","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","feline infectious peritonitis virus","Ames","National Veterinary Services Laboratories","swine testicular cells","sufficient size","Insavc","canine coronavirus","spike","genetic relationships","site","initial infectivity","FIPV","biological variation","nucleocapsid","RNA recombination","related coronaviruses","insight","CCVs"],"language":"en"},

The second virial coefficient, b(2), derived from the dilution enthalpies of protein solution measured by ITC under various experimental conditions was studied. The protein applied in this work is human recombinant interferon-\u03B12a (hrIFN-\u03B12a), which is a commercial drug applied for the treatment of virus-infected diseases. The results obtained were used to predict the possibility of hrIFN-\u03B12a aggregation, and the prediction can be further confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Various factors affecting the stability of protein solution were investigated, for example, temperature, salts, surfactants, and mechanical stress. Specifically, the results show that the dilution enthalpy of hrIFN-\u03B12a increased with increasing temperature and NaCl concentration, while b(2) decreased, indicating that the attraction between hrIFN-\u03B12a molecules was enhanced under these conditions. On studying the effect of mechanical stress, the data obtained reveals that the introduction of centrifugal or vortex force strengthened the attractive forces between hrIFN-\u03B12a molecules. These implications were supported by SEC data, demonstrating that the amount of aggregated hrIFN-\u03B12a was increased. As a consequence, the methodologies presented in this investigation offer a possibility of monitoring the physical stability of protein solution at various stages of recovery, purification as well as the development of appropriate drug storage formulations.","publish_time":"2005-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Shir-Ly; Lin, Fu-Yung; Yang, Chih-Ping","journal":"Eur J Pharm Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ITC","SEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hrIFN-\u03B12a molecules","aggregated hrIFN-\u03B12a","\u03B12a aggregation","possibility of hrIFN","physical stability of protein solution","dilution enthalpies of protein solution","dilution enthalpy of hrIFN","human recombinant interferon-\u03B12a","Various factors","ITC","various experimental conditions","SEC data","results","various stages of recovery","effect of mechanical stress","increasing temperature","commercial drug","development of appropriate drug storage formulations","attractive forces","vortex force","isothermal titration calorimetry","introduction of centrifugal","reveals","salts","surfactants","work","example","treatment of virus","NaCl concentration","purification","size-exclusion chromatography","infected diseases","prediction","applicability","attraction","methodologies","virial coefficient","investigation","implications","consequence"],"language":"en"},

This threatens the integrity of epidemiological data and may misdirect treatment and control efforts. We report the development of RT-PCR tests that distinguish live FluMist\u2122 vaccine (FMV) strains from circulating influenza strains in clinical samples. Primers were validated using influenza-positive samples from unvaccinated patients, packaged FMV, and one PCR-positive asymptomatic vaccine. Furthermore, the assay was used to experimentally test our lab\u0027s collection of influenza-positive samples from the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 influenza seasons and several 2005 preseason isolates to determine the rate of vaccine-derived false-positive results under differing epidemiological conditions. Analytical and clinical validations show that the assay is both sensitive and specific. Experimental results demonstrate that 51 out of 51 influenza-positive samples collected during influenza season from ill, previously-vaccinated military personnel represent real infections with circulating strains. Finally, the assay shows that four preseason influenza-positive samples were false positives resulting from vaccine shedding. The vaccine-discriminatory RT-PCR methods described here provide the first test designed to distinguish FMV strains from circulating strains. The results show that the test is effective, and demonstrate the importance of such tests in the age of live vaccines.","publish_time":"2006-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freed, Nikki E.; Myers, Christopher A.; Russell, Kevin L.; Walter, Elizabeth A.; Irvine, Marina; Coon, Robert G.; Metzgar, David","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fede421f4fe867ff75aee6a1fa02f0b80c5b31fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preseason influenza-positive samples","circulating influenza strains","PCR-positive asymptomatic vaccine","influenza seasons","FMV strains","PCR tests","circulating strains","derived false-positive results","clinical samples","common influenza assays","lab\u0027s collection of influenza","vaccine-discriminatory RT-PCR methods","rate of vaccine","vaccine shedding","Experimental results","reverse transcriptase-PCR","false positives","packaged FMV","live FluMist","antigen tests","development of RT","age of live vaccines","preseason isolates","clinical validations","differing epidemiological conditions","integrity of epidemiological data","unvaccinated patients","military personnel","real infections","treatment","culture","importance","control efforts","Primers"],"language":"en"},

The chapter also reviews genetic pharmacology as it relates to antiviral antisense research and drug development. Antisense oligonucleotides are selective compounds by virtue of their interaction with specific segments of RNA. For potential antivirals, identification of appropriate target RNA sequences for antisense oligonucleotides is performed at two levels: the optimal gene within the virus, and the optimal sequence within the RNA. The importance of these oligonucleotide modifications in designing effective drugs is just now being evaluated, both in animal model systems and in the clinic. The first generation of widely used antisense oligonucleotides has been the phosphorothioate (PS) compounds and a body of data on biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in animals and in humans is now available. Since the identification and sequencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a strong interest in identifying a potent oligonucleotide inhibitor that would have the potential for development as a therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Numerous phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, with no apparent antisense sequence specificity, can have an anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) effect. Oligonucleotides can be effective anti-influenza agents in cell culture assays. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein that is a transactivator has been also reported to be targeted successfully by antisense oligonucleotides in vivo. Several of picornaviruses have been targets for antisense oligonucleotide inhibition, and the studies demonstrate the versatility of the antisense approach. However, the fact that oligonucleotides may contribute numerous mechanisms toward the antiviral activity, in addition to the antisense mechanism, may in some cases be an asset in the pursuit of clinically useful antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2008-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kilkuskie, R.E.; Field, A.K.","journal":"Adv Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzExMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Antisense oligonucleotides","antiviral antisense research","antisense mechanism","antisense approach","antisense oligonucleotide inhibition","Numerous phosphorothioate oligonucleotides","apparent antisense sequence specificity","antiviral activity","novel antiviral drug targets","novel antiviral strategies","useful antiviral drugs","anti-herpes simplex virus","sequencing of human immunodeficiency virus","Hepatitis B virus","drug development","oligonucleotide modifications","effective drugs","optimal sequence","chapter","specific segments of RNA","potent oligonucleotide inhibitor","identification of appropriate target RNA sequences","effective anti-influenza agents","selective compounds","potential antivirals","numerous mechanisms","immunodeficiency syndrome","optimal gene","virtue","interaction","cell culture assays","X protein","new approaches","pharmacokinetics","HBV","HSV","therapy","pursuit","studies","body of data","animals","metabolism","biodistribution","cases","HIV","PS","addition","levels","genetic pharmacology","animal model systems","clinic","humans","asset","AIDS","versatility","fact","transactivator","importance","picornaviruses","generation"],"language":"en"},

A monoclonal antibody with a high affinity against an oocyst antigen was used to set up the test. The efficiency of this assay was compared with that of the flotation test; 275 calf faecal samples were examined by the two methods. There was 96% agreement between the two tests. For the 11 conflicting samples, the two tests were repeated and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed on faecal smears. All these 11 samples contained few oocysts, but only five and six of them were shown to be positive by the ELISA and flotation tests, respectively. The degree of sensitivity of the ELISA and flotation tests is comparable; samples heavily or moderately contaminated with oocysts are detected by both methods. This ELISA is reliable and never gives rise to false positive results. Nevertheless, as with the flotation test, the occasional case containing very few oocysts will not always be detected by this test. If necessary, very accurate diagnosis can be made by a staining technique or by a direct immunofluorescent assay. In veterinary medicine, the ELISA seems to be a method of choice; it appears to be a fast and reliable technique which could be used as a routine test for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Nevertheless the degree of sensitivity must always be borne in mind. There is no need for a microscopic examination, which is an additional advantage.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robert, B.; Ginter, A.; Antoine, H.; Collard, A.; Coppe, P.","journal":"Vet Parasitol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ELISA","flotation tests","routine test","conflicting samples","calf faecal samples","staining technique","reliable technique","detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts","degree of sensitivity","methods","direct immunofluorescent assay","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","faecal smears","accurate diagnosis","diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis","false positive results","modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining","high affinity","rise","occasional case","microscopic examination","monoclonal antibody","oocyst antigen","paper","additional advantage","need","veterinary medicine","method of choice","mind","efficiency","agreement"],"language":"en"},

Incorporation of [(3)H]mannose into N-linked glycoproteins by aged cells was further reduced (\u223C35%). Similarly microsomal membranes from parotid glands of aged animals showed \u223C50% reduction in the synthesis of mannosylphosphoryl dolichol, a key intermediate in the dolichol pathway of protein N-glycosylation. Man-P-Dol synthase, the microsomal enzyme responsible for production of this saccharide-lipid, displayed no change in apparent K(m) for GDP-mannose when preparations from aged animals were utilized, but did show \u223C50% reduction in V(max). Following \u03B2-adrenoreceptor activation, cells from both young adult and aged glands showed increased N-linked protein glycosylation almost to the same extent (\u223C2-fold). The data suggested that in aged rat parotid cells there is a basal reduction of activity in the pathway responsible for asparagine-linked protein glycosylation, but that following exocytotic stimuli this pathway responds in a manner comparable to cells from young adult glands.","publish_time":"2003-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kousvelari, Eleni E.; Banerjee, Dipak K.; Murty, Lalita; Baum, Bruce J.","journal":"Mech Ageing Dev","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COOH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aged cells","aged glands","aged rat parotid cells","parotid glands of aged animals","dolichol pathway of protein N-glycosylation","increased N-linked protein glycosylation","asparagine-linked protein glycosylation","young adult glands","general protein production","N-linked glycoproteins","COOH insoluble protein","dispersed rat parotid acinar cells","pathway responsible","months","microsomal enzyme responsible","basal reduction of activity","microsomal membranes","GDP-mannose","lower incorporation","synthesis of mannosylphosphoryl dolichol","manner comparable","CCI","saccharide-lipid","P-Dol synthase","continuous pulse","small decrease","\u03B2-adrenoreceptor activation","exocytotic stimuli","preparations","change","extent","data","leucine","max","fold","rats"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To develop a psychometrically sound instrument for identifying and measuring the core competencies needed by Chinese nursing baccalaureate graduates. DESIGN: Descriptive correlational and multicentre study. SETTING: Seven major tertiary teaching hospitals and three major medical universities in Beijing. PARTICIPANTS: 790 subjects, including patients, nursing faculty members, doctors and nurses. METHOD: A reliable and valid self-report instrument, consisting of 58 items, was developed using multiple methods. It was then distributed to 790 subjects to measure nursing competency in a broader Chinese context. The psychometric characteristics of reliability and validity were supported by descriptive and inferential analyses. RESULTS: The final instrument consists of six dimensions with 47 items. The content validity index was 0.90. The overall scale reliability was 0.97 with dimensions range from 0.87 to 0.94. Six domains of core competencies were identified: professionalism; direct care; support and communication; application of professional knowledge; personal traits; and critical thinking and innovation. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide valuable evidence for a psychometrically sound measurement tool, as well as for competency-based nursing curriculum reform.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Fang Yu; Zhao, Rong Rong; Liu, Yi Si; Wu, Ying; Jin, Ning Ning; Li, Rui Ying; Shi, Shu Ping; Shao, Yue Ying; Guo, Ming; Arthur, David; Elliott, Malcolm","journal":"Nurse Educ Today","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130637/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["sound instrument","measure nursing competency","domains of core competencies","Chinese nursing baccalaureate graduates","nursing faculty members","graduated Chinese nurses","subjects","final instrument","dimensions","items","competency-based nursing curriculum reform","broader Chinese context","valid self-report instrument","multicentre study","major medical universities","sound measurement tool","overall scale reliability","psychometric characteristics of reliability","content validity index","major tertiary teaching hospitals","personal traits","application of professional knowledge","support","communication","patients","valuable evidence","direct care","doctors","professionalism","critical thinking","findings","SETTING","DESIGN","literature","innovation","Beijing","inferential analyses","BACKGROUND","review","multiple methods","CONCLUSION","PARTICIPANTS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

On the basis of these data and previously reported genotoxicity testing, HCFC-141b is considered non-genotoxic.

No exposure-related effects of toxicological significance were noted with respect to survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weight analysis. Reduced food intake and body weight gain were noted in both sexes of the 15,000 ppm group during the first 16 wk; thereafter, body weight gains in all groups were similar although the intergroup differences in body weight remained evident. Reduced food intake persisted in both sexes through wk 52 and in females during the second year of exposure. Treatment-related effects on macroscopic pathology were confined to increased incidences of testicular masses and altered appearance. Microscopic pathology examinations confirmed the testes as the target organ with findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours and hyperplasia at 5000 and 20,000 ppm. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 1500 ppm. The testicular changes at high exposure levels were considered to be due to a change of the senile hormonal imbalance in geriatric rats and of little significance for the assessment of human health effects.","publish_time":"2000-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Millischer, R.-J.; de Rooij, C.G.; Rush, G.M.; Farr, C.H.; Ben-Dyke, R.; Hardy, C.J.; Lewis, D.J.; Hodson-Walker, G.","journal":"Food Chem Toxicol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131127/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":["CHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wk of exposure","HCFC","ppm group","body weight gains","year of exposure","exposure-related effects of toxicological significance","organ weight analysis","target organ","sexes","Reduced food intake","Groups","Treatment-related effects","high exposure levels","assessment of human health effects","incidences of testicular masses","clinical chemistry","clinical signs","little significance","geriatric rats","target concentrations","human lymphocytes","macroscopic pathology","testicular changes","findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours","chromosomal aberration assays","Microscopic pathology examinations","Bacterial gene mutation assays","female Sprague-Dawley rats","mouse micronucleus inhalation assay","CHO cells","Escherichia coli","Salmonella typhimurium","ophthalmoscopy","haematology","testes","urinalysis","intergroup differences","senile hormonal imbalance","respect","survival","hyperplasia","reported genotoxicity testing","effect level","data","altered appearance","NOAEL","females","observable-adverse","days","control","tester strains","basis","tests","vapour","battery of"],"language":"en"},

The primary health impact of rubella virus is that it is a teratogenic agent. The vaccination strategy is aimed at elimination of rubella and includes both universal vaccination of infants at 15 months of age with the trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and specific targeting with the rubella vaccine of seronegative women planning pregnancy and seronegative adults who could come in contact with women of childbearing age, although it is recommended that any individual over the age of 12 months without evidence of natural infection or vaccination be vaccinated.

Simultaneously, and at each dose of cocaine, unconditioned psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied in terms of multiple concurrent measures of spontaneous behavior and by activity patterns of locomotion. Time course studies showed that the neurochemical effects of cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p\u003C0.001) increased accumbens synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and concurrently and significantly (p\u003C0.0001) decreased accumbens synaptic concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in a dose response manner. Simulataneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p\u003C0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p\u003C0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p\u003C0.0002).

The liver has emerged as the major organ participating in the degradation and elimination of arachidonate products of systemic origin. The synthesis in the liver of arachidonate products derived from the cfyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 system pathways has been demonstrated. The participation of leukotriene B(4) and cysteinyl-leukotrienes as mediators of liver damage and the possible therapeutic usefulness of prostaglandins (PGs) in acute liver injury has attracted the interest of clinicians. This article reviews the essential features regarding the role of arachidonate metabolites in liver disease and specially focuses on the cytoprotective effects on the liver displayed by PGE(2), PGE(1), PGI(2) and synthetic PG analogs in experimental models of liver damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury, carbon tetrachloride, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral hepatitis and on the possible mechanisms underlying liver cytoprotection in these experimental models. The therapeutic usefulness of PGs in clinical practice is critically analyzed on the basis of available evidence in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and primary graft nonfunction following liver transplantation.","publish_time":"2002-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quiroga, Jorge; Prieto, Jesus","journal":"Pharmacol Ther","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liver disease","liver cytoprotection","liver transplantation","liver of arachidonate products","mediators of liver damage","acute liver injury","experimental models of liver damage","therapeutic usefulness of PGs","PGE","possible therapeutic usefulness of prostaglandins","role of arachidonate metabolites","elimination of arachidonate products of systemic origin","possible mechanisms","ischemia-reperfusion injury","fulminant hepatic failure","carbon tetrachloride","primary graft nonfunction","patients","bacterial lipopolysaccharide","viral hepatitis","lipoxygenase","cfyclooxygenase","synthetic PG analogs","basis of available evidence","relationships","degradation","cytochrome P450 system pathways","essential features","clinical practice","cysteinyl-leukotrienes","knowledge","arachidonic acid cascade","major organ","decade intensive work","PGI","cytoprotective effects","synthesis","participation of leukotriene B","area of research","article","clinicians"],"language":"en"},

For influenza A virus infections, both oral amantadine and rimantadine are effectvive when used for seasonal prophylaxis and for prophylaxis in institutional populations. Both of these drugs, as well as aerosilized ribavirin, have antiviral and therapeutic effects in uncomplicated influenza. It remains to be determined whether any of these modalities or possibly their combined use [44] will be useful in treating severe influenza in hospitalized patients or whether they can prevent the development of complications in high risk patients. Unfortunately, there is no parenteral formulation of amantadine or rimantadine for use in critically in patients. Aerosolized ribavirin has also been shown to have modest therapeutic effects in influenza B virus infection. However, a major need exists for an antiviral which is active against influenza B virus and which can be used on an outpatient basis. Controlled clinical trials have shown that aerosolized ribavirin therapy improves arterial oxygenation and modifies the severity fo respiratory syncytil virus bronchiolitis and pneumonia [3,5]. Its role in treatinglife-threatening disease or in dodifying the long-term sequelae of RSV infections are unknown at the present time. Again, a specific antiviral agent is needed for out-patient use in preventing or treating RSV infections. Finally, after over a decade of work since the original observation that intranasal interferon could prevent experimental rhinoirus infection [11], recent studies have established that intranasal rIFN-a2 is effective in the postexposure prophylaxis of rhinovirus colds in families [42]. This strategy needs to be studied with regard to the prevention of infection and its complications in high risk patients and it remains to be determined whether intranasal interferen will have therapeutic activity in established colds.","publish_time":"2012-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayden, Frederick G.","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfbc1d438a8c72760465f4ce3f04cb0211d1e848.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzcwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infections","influenza B virus infection","severe influenza","uncomplicated influenza","high risk patients","hospitalized patients","respiratory viral infections","therapeutic activity","intranasal interferon","modest therapeutic effects","seasonal prophylaxis","long-term sequelae of RSV infections","clinical applications of antiviral agents","rimantadine","intranasal interferen","prevention of infection","specific antiviral agent","aerosolized ribavirin therapy","aerosilized ribavirin","patient use","combined use","established colds","postexposure prophylaxis of rhinovirus colds","severity fo respiratory syncytil virus bronchiolitis","experimental rhinoirus infection","intranasal rIFN-a2","oral amantadine","development of complications","clinical trials","parenteral formulation of amantadine","dodifying","arterial oxygenation","original observation","treatinglife-threatening disease","pneumonia","effectvive","recent studies","families","decade of work","present time","institutional populations","role","regard","Table","modalities","drugs","major need","outpatient basis","strategy"],"language":"en"},

Normal adult A/J mice are resistant, and BALB/c mice are susceptible. Higher titers of virus and interferon (IFN) in vivo were found in MHV3-infected BALB/c mice compared with A/J mice. In vitro activation of macrophages (M\u0424) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delayed MHV3 replication only in cells that originated from A/J mice, although cell populations from both A/J, and BALB/c mice were able to synthesize comparable amounts of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that the delayed MHV3 replication in LPS-activated A/J M\u0424 was due, in part, to IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2. A/J M\u0424 were found to be more sensitive to IFN-\u03B3 than to IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2, and BALB/c M\u0424 did not develop an antiviral state to either IFN. Cultured spleen cells from A/J mice synthesized more IFN-\u03B3 than BALB/c spleen cells after specific or non-specific stimulation. The results indicate that IFN-activated M\u0424 may play a crucial role in the resistance to MHV3 infection. Since IFN-\u03B3 is produced in large amounts by A/J spleen cells after specific stimulation with MHV3 and is efficient in activating the A/J M\u0424, a T cell-dependent mechanism- is likely to be involved.","publish_time":"2011-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucchiari, Maria A.; Pereira, Carlos A.","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozc1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["A/J M\u0424","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["J mice","J M\u0424","c mice","IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B1","IFN-activated M\u0424","c M\u0424","J spleen cells","Resistance of mice","c spleen cells","MHV3-infected BALB","MHV3 infection","comparable amounts of IFN","delayed MHV3 replication","Cultured spleen cells","LPS-activated","specific antibodies","large amounts","non-specific stimulation","cell populations","hepatitis virus type","Higher titers of virus","T cell-dependent mechanism","crucial role","lipopolysaccharide","interferon","antiviral state","results","activation of macrophages"],"language":"en"},

These costs have been estimated at 1.8 billion dollars per year in the United States.(47) Parents of children attending child-care facilities miss from 1 to 4 weeks of work per year caring for ill children.(28) Increased risk for infections in child-care settings is of public health significance because of potential transmission to adult contacts and dissemination into the community.(88) Infections acquired in child-care settings that are mild or asymptomatic in children may be severe in adults.(85)","publish_time":"1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Churchill, Robin B.; Pickering, Larry K.","journal":"Infect Dis Clin North Am","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozg3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Parents of children","ill children","increased morbidity of children","child-care facilities","child-care settings","increasing numbers of children","Increased rates of infections","home care settings","increased risk","variety of infections","home child care","incidence of respiratory tract infections","United States","years of age","cost of medical care","loss of work","economic factors","weeks of work","significant economic impact","public health significance","potential transmission","adult contacts","diarrheal disease","cytomegalovirus","hepatitis","dissemination","bacterial meningitis","community","dollars","adults","form","costs"],"language":"en"},

The animals died cf acute hepatitis with high viral titres in the liver accompanied by many necrotic foci and high serum transaminase levels. Resistance to virus was re-established by refeeding HC mice with a normal diet for 2 weeks. This of modification by pathogenesis was accompanied by an increase in the susceptibility of hepatocyte cultures from HC mice to MHV3 and could be explained by an enhancement in virus adsorption. We hypothesize that the incorporation of cholesterol into the plasma membranes of hepatocytes of HC mice, thereby decreasing the membrane fluidity, may lead to an increase in the availability of virus receptors.","publish_time":"2002-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braunwald, J.; Nonnenmacher, H.; Pereira, C.A.; Kirn, A.","journal":"Res Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozk5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["refeeding HC mice","J mice susceptible","increase","MHV3","virus adsorption","availability of virus receptors","mouse hepatitis","normal diet","high viral titres","cf acute hepatitis","high serum transaminase levels","necrotic foci","plasma membranes of hepatocytes","susceptibility of hepatocyte cultures","liver","animals","incorporation of cholesterol","infection","hypercholesterolaemic","membrane fluidity","pathogenesis","weeks","enhancement","Resistance","administration","modification"],"language":"en"}]}

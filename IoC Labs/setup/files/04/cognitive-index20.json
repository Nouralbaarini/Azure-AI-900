However, murine-derived monoclonal antibodies may cause an immunogenic response in human patients, reducing their therapeutic efficacy. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have been developed that are less likely to provoke an immune reaction in human patients than are murine-derived antibodies. Antibody fragments, bispecific antibodies, and antibodies produced through the use of phage display systems and genetically modified plants and animals may aid researchers in developing new uses for monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of disease. Monoclonal antibodies may have a number of promising potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of asthma, autoimmune diseases, cancer, poisoning, septicemia, substance abuse, viral infections, and other diseases.","publish_time":"2002-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berger, Mitchell; Shankar, Vidya; Vafai, Abbas","journal":"The American Journal of the Medical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef2c238dd55e20a6ea81a9f411747585341dcbee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093874.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002962915344347; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002962915344347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bispecific antibodies","humanized antibodies","murine-derived monoclonal antibodies","murine-derived antibodies","human patients","therapeutic efficacy","number of promising potential therapeutic applications","treatment of asthma","treatment of disease","autoimmune diseases","ABSTRACT Researchers","septicemia","poisoning","modified plants","cancer","substance abuse","use of phage display systems","immunogenic response","viral infections","animals","new uses","immune reaction","Antibody fragments","development"],"language":"en"},

Beyond, crisis communication increasingly relies upon online communication for exchanging information and opinions on a crisis and for supporting the coordination of resources including equipment, personnel, and information during a crisis situation. This chapter gives an overview on social media tools and data sources and their content with respect to a use in disease surveillance and health crisis management.

Sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) assays are available for RVA but require submission of the clinical samples to diagnostic laboratories. Patient-side immunoassays for RVA protein detection have shown variable results, particularly with samples from unintended species. A sensitive and specific test for detection of RVA on the farm would facilitate rapid management decisions. The insulated isothermal RT-PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay works in a portable machine to allow sensitive and specific on-site testing. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate a commercially available RT-iiPCR assay for RVA detection in feces from different animal species. This assay was compared to an in-house rtRT-PCR assay and a commercially available rtRT-PCR kit, as well as an ELISA and EM for RVA detection. All three PCR assays targeted the well-conserved NSP5 gene. Clinical fecal samples from 108 diarrheic animals (mainly cattle and horses) were tested. The percentage of positive samples by ELISA, EM, in-house rtRT-PCR, commercial rtRT-PCR, and RT-iiPCR was 29.4%, 31%, 36.7%, 51.4%, 56.9%, respectively. The agreement between different assays was high (81.3\u2013100%) in samples containing high viral loads. The sensitivity of the RT-iiPCR assay appeared to be higher than the commercially available rtRT-PCR assay, with a limit of detection (95% confidence index) of 3\u20134 copies of in vitro transcribed dsRNA. In conclusion, the user-friendly, field-deployable RT-iiPCR system holds substantial promise for on-site detection of RVA.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soltan, Mohamed A.; Tsai, Yun-Long; Lee, Pei-Yu A.; Tsai, Chuan-Fu; Chang, Hsiao-Fen G.; Wang, Hwa-Tang T.; Wilkes, Rebecca P.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25afaa16aaa7938ea5cd13758c98dab919174be8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113751.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416300489; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416300489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27180038/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rotavirus Group A","RVA","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVA detection","available rtRT-PCR assay","PCR assays","in-house rtRT-PCR assay","available RT-iiPCR assay","commercial rtRT-PCR","on-site detection of RVA","RVA protein detection","specific real-time RT-PCR","available rtRT-PCR kit","insulated isothermal RT-PCR","limit of detection","clinical samples","field-deployable RT-iiPCR system","detection of Rotavirus Group","Clinical fecal samples","different assays","percentage of positive samples","ELISA","specific on-site testing","specific test","different animal species","diarrheic animals","neonatal animals","unintended species","high viral loads","substantial promise","feces","variable results","gold standard","farm","portable machine","submission","well-conserved NSP5 gene","main causes of diarrhea","immunoassays","diagnostic laboratories","rapid management decisions","copies of","cattle","horses","confidence index","Patient","agreement","sensitivity","transcribed dsRNA","Abstract","conclusion","investigation","aim"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Seventeen NHs with at least one ARI resident in Corsica, France, were included. An ARI resident was defined as a resident developing a sudden onset of any constitutional symptoms in addition to any respiratory signs. Nasopharyngeal swabs from ARI residents were screened for the presence of 21 respiratory agents, including seasonal influenza viruses. RESULTS: Of the 107 ARI residents enrolled from NHs, 61 (57%) were positive for at least one of the 21 respiratory pathogens. Forty-one (38.3%) of the 107 ARI residents had influenza: 38 (92%) were positive for influenza A (100% A(H3N2)) and three (8%) for influenza B/Victoria. Axillary fever (\u226538\u00B0C) was significantly more common among patients infected with influenza A(H3N2). CONCLUSION: The circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses other than influenza A(H3N2) seems to be sporadic among elderly NH residents. Investigating the circulation of respiratory viruses in nonwinter seasons seems to be important in order to understand better the dynamic of their year-round circulation in NHs.","publish_time":"2017-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masse, Shirley; Capai, Lisandru; Falchi, Alessandra","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f7c1aeb6e5b1e35d6be98d478259a83a8dd6993.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5748090.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29392127/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1423718","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["ARI residents","circulation of respiratory viruses","seasonal influenza viruses","respiratory agents","circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses","respiratory signs","respiratory pathogens","influenza B","elderly NH residents","acute respiratory infections","NHs","H3N2","year-round circulation","nonwinter seasons","clinical characteristics of elderly nursing home","ARIs","constitutional symptoms","addition","sudden onset","dynamic","presence","current study","order","Corsica","France","patients","Nasopharyngeal swabs","CONCLUSION","Axillary fever","BACKGROUND","microbiological etiology","Victoria","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Pregnancy and early childhood are particularly susceptible for exogenous influences due to the developing nature of a child\u2019s immune system. While endogenous influences such as family history and the genetic background are immutable, epigenetic regulations can be modulated by both heredity and environmental exposures. Prenatal influences such as a mother\u2019s nutrition, smoking, or infections influence the complex interplay of innate and adaptive immune regulation as well as peri- and postnatal influences including mode of delivery. Early in life, induction and continuous training of healthy maturation include balanced innate immunity (e.g., via innate lymphoid cells) and an equilibrium of T-cell subpopulations (e.g., via regulatory T cells) to counter-regulate potential pro-inflammatory or exuberant immune reactions. Later in childhood, rather compensatory immune mechanisms are required to modulate deviant regulation of a child\u2019s already primed immune trajectory.

Consequently, a variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles in continuous airflow conditions. However, since aerosolized infectious viral-testing is inadvisable due to safety concerns, their anti-viral capability has only been tested by inserting the filters into liquid media, where infectious virus particles disperse. In this study a novel method of determining anti-viral performance of an air filter against airborne infectious viruses is presented. Initially, anti-viral air filter tests were conducted. Firstly, by an air-media test, in which the air filter was placed against an aerosolized non-infectious virus. Secondly, by a liquid-media test, in which the filter was inserted into a liquid medium containing a non-infectious virus. Subsequently, a correlation was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained between the two medium tests and an association was found for the air medium test with infectious virus. After ensuring the relationship did not depend on the virus species, the correlation was used to derive the results of the air-medium test from the results of the liquid-medium test.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Dae Hoon; Joe, Yun Haeng; Piri, Amin; An, Sanggwon; Hwang, Jungho","journal":"J Hazard Mater","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/845c11e60e19b90e49a5f22d3c6764029c918c55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152926.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389420306294; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420306294?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339873/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122640","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["air medium test","air-medium test","air-media test","liquid-medium test","liquid medium","anti-viral air filter tests","infectious virus particles","liquid-media test","medium tests","liquid media","virus species","variety of air filters","aerosolized non-infectious virus","infectious viral-testing","anti-viral performance","anti-viral capability","airborne infectious viruses","results","correlation","lethal viruses","prevention","safety concerns","treatment of respiratory infection outbreaks","novel method","continuous airflow conditions","association","various studies","antimicrobial agents","study","susceptibility constants","relationship"],"language":"en"},

We compared the extent of oxidative injury in MS lesions with that in experimental models driven by different inflammatory mechanisms. It was only in a model of coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis that we detected an accumulation of oxidised phospholipids, which was comparable in extent to that in MS. In both, MS and coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis, this was associated with massive microglial and macrophage activation, accompanied by the expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox but only sparse expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Acute and chronic CD4(\u002B) T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions showed transient expression of p22phox and iNOS associated with inflammation. Macrophages in chronic lesions of antibody-mediated demyelinating encephalomyelitis showed lysosomal activity but very little p22phox or iNOS expressions. Active inflammatory demyelinating lesions induced by CD8(\u002B) T cells or by innate immunity showed macrophage and microglial activation together with the expression of p22phox, but low or absent iNOS reactivity. We corroborated the differences between acute CD4(\u002B) T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and acute MS lesions via gene expression studies. Furthermore, age-dependent iron accumulation and lesion-associated iron liberation, as occurring in the human brain, were only minor in rodent brains. Our study shows that oxidative injury and its triggering mechanisms diverge in different models of rodent central nervous system inflammation. The amplification of oxidative injury, which has been suggested in MS, is only reflected to a limited degree in the studied rodent models.

In this study, an integrative, participatory research approach was used to elucidate the sanitation and disease prevention practices in small-scale poultry slaughterhouses in rural northern Thailand. METHODS: Initial steps included the identification of key stakeholders associated with the meat production chain, development of a research framework, and design of a methodology based on stakeholder consultations. The framework and methodology combine issues in five major areas: (1) public health, (2) socioeconomics, (3) policy, (4) veterinary medicine, and (5) communities and the environment. Methods used include questionnaires, direct observation, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. In addition, a microbiological risk assessment approach was employed to detect Salmonella contamination in meat processing facilities. The microbial risk assessment was combined with stakeholder perceptions to provide an overview of the existing situation, as well as to identify opportunities for upgrading slaughterhouses in order to more effectively address matters of food safety, processing, and government licensing. RESULTS: The conceptual framework developed elucidated the complex factors limiting small-scale slaughterhouse improvement including a lack of appropriate enabling policies and an apparent absence of feasible interventions for improvement. Unhygienic slaughterhouse management was reflected in the incidence of Salmonella contamination in both the meat and the surrounding environment. CONCLUSION: There is potential for the use of an integrative approach to address critical problems at the interface of rural development and public health. The findings of this study could serve as a model for transdisciplinary studies and interventions related to other similar complex challenges.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of infection control measures among healthcare workers (HCWs) who were exposed to a MERS patient and/or his body fluids in our institute. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted among HCWs who worked with a MERS patient in Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between 18 June and 3 July 2015. Contacts were defined as HCWs who worked in the patient\u2019s room or with the patient\u2019s body fluids. Serum samples from all contacts were collected within 14 days of last contact and one month later. Paired sera were tested for detection of MERS\u2010CoV antibodies by using an indirect ELISA. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (88.4 %) of 43 identified contacts consented to enroll. The mean (SD) age was 38.1 (11.1) years, and 79 % were females. The median (IQR) cumulative duration of work of HCWs in the patient\u2019s room was 35 (20\u2013165) minutes. The median (IQR) cumulative duration of work of HCWs with the patient\u2019s blood or body fluids in laboratory was 67.5 (43.7\u2013117.5) minutes. All contacts reported 100 % compliance with hand hygiene, using N95 respirator, performing respirator fit test, wearing gown, gloves, eye protection, and cap during their entire working period. All serum specimens of contacts tested for MERS-CoV antibodies were negative. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence of effective infection control practices against MERS-CoV transmission in a healthcare facility. Strict infection control precautions can protect HCWs. The optimal infection control measures for MERS-CoV should be further evaluated.","publish_time":"2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiboonchutikul, Surasak; Manosuthi, Weerawat; Likanonsakul, Sirirat; Sangsajja, Chariya; Kongsanan, Paweena; Nitiyanontakij, Ravee; Thientong, Varaporn; Lerdsamran, Hatairat; Puthavathana, Pilaipan","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62406757c331d6c939bf09fa005bb565b3fac0b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4877934.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222710/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-016-0120-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["HCWs","MERS-CoV antibodies","MERS patient","MERS-CoV transmission","detection of MERS","patient\u2019s body fluids","patient\u2019s room","identified contacts","effectiveness of infection control measures","optimal infection control measures","serum specimens of contacts","Strict infection control precautions","patient\u2019s blood","evidence of effective infection control practices","cumulative duration of work","IQR","median","minutes","N95 respirator","healthcare workers","healthcare facility","Serum samples","respirator fit test","Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute","hospital-associated outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","cap","gloves","gown","eye protection","hand hygiene","Thailand","compliance","laboratory","entire working period","age","INTRODUCTION","days","descriptive study","indirect ELISA","Paired sera","years","mean","SD","month","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","females","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We constructed a human behavior integrated hierarchical (HiHi) model based on the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) model, the Wells-Riley equation, and population movement considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. The model considers more than 7 million people, 3 million indoor environments, and 2566 public transport routes in Hong Kong. Smallpox, which could be spread through airborne routes, is studied as an example. The simulation is based on people\u0027s daily commutes and indoor human behaviors, which were summarized by mathematical patterns. We found that 59.6%, 18.1%, and 13.4% of patients become infected in their homes, offices, and schools, respectively. If both work stoppage and school closure measures are taken when the number of infected people is greater than 1000, an infectious disease will be effectively controlled after 2 months. The peak number of infected people will be reduced by 25% compared to taking no action, and the time of peak infections will be delayed by about 40 days if 90% of the infected people go to hospital during the infectious period. When ventilation rates in indoor environments increase to five times their default settings, smallpox will be naturally controlled. Residents of Kowloon and the north part of Hong Kong Island have a high risk of infection from airborne infectious diseases. Our HiHi model reduces the calculation time for infection rates to an acceptable level while preserving accuracy.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Nan; Huang, Hong; Su, Boni; Ma, Xun; Li, Yuguo","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/695abb67710c45651031cfddd591559c1a771015.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115769.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287976/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.11.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132317305188; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132317305188","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MERS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Hong Kong Island"],"keyphrases":["airborne infectious diseases","HiHi model","infectious period","peak number of infected people","indoor environments","Hong Kong Island","Abstract Epidemics of infectious diseases","infection rates","indoor human behaviors","airborne routes","Smallpox","public transport routes","time of peak infections","public health","calculation time","ventilation rates","high risk of infection","population movement","people\u0027s daily commutes","H1N1","SARS","times","large cities","Wells-Riley equation","acceptable level","MERS","homes","SIR","hospital","school closure measures","temporal dimensions","default settings","stoppage","simulation","offices","Residents of Kowloon","schools","accuracy","patients","action","mathematical patterns","example","days","months"],"language":"en"},

The human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently recognized parvovirus isolated from human respiratory secretions. OBJECTIVES: To define the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics in adult and pediatric patients with evidence of HBoV. STUDY DESIGN: From October 2005 through October 2006, we screened respiratory samples from children and adults negative for common respiratory pathogens for HBoV by PCR. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records of HBoV positive individuals. RESULTS: Of 2075 samples screened, 1826 (88.0%) represented distinct respiratory events: 1539 (84.3%) were pediatric (\u003C18 years), and 273 (15.0%) adult (\u226518 years). Forty (2.2%) patients had HBoV: 36 (2.3%) children and 4 (1.5%) adults. HBoV positive children had history of prematurity (31.3%) and cardiac disease (18.8%). Adults had underlying pulmonary (100%) and cardiac (50%) disease. Twenty-seven children (84.4%) were hospitalized; 9 (28.1%) required intensive care. All adults were hospitalized; none required intensive care. Nosocomial acquisition likely occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV circulates in Cleveland, OH, in children and adults with similar frequencies, and can warrant hospitalization and intensive care.

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS-CoV-infected patients by using MERS-CoV-specific convalescent plasma obtained from previously recovered patients. METHODS: A survey was adapted from validated questionnaire originally aimed to measure network capacities and capabilities within the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). The questionnaire was modified for this study to include 26 items that were divided into three main domains of interest: (1) the ability to care for critically ill MERS-CoV patients; (2) laboratory capacity to diagnose MERS-CoV and blood bank ability to prepare convalescent plasma; and (3), research capacity to conduct randomized controlled trials. The questionnaire was emailed to physicians. RESULTS: Of 582 physicians who were invited to the survey, 327 responded (56.2 %). The professional focus of the majority of respondents was critical care (106/249 (43 %)), pediatrics (59/249, (24 %)) or internal medicine (52/249 (21 %)) but none was blood banking. Nearly all respondents (251/263 (95 %)) reported to have access to ICU facilities within their institutions. Most respondents (219/270 (81 %)) reported that intensivists were the most physician group responsible for treatment decisions about critically ill SARI patients. While 125/165 respondents (76 %) reported that they conduct research in ICUs, and 80/161 (49.7 %) had been involved in the conduct of RCTs, including using a placebo comparison (60/161 (37 %)), only 49/226 (21 %) of respondents regularly participated in research networks. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey indicated that in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), ICUs are the most likely clinical locations for conducting a clinical trial of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS-CoV, and that most ICUs have experience with such research designs.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Social media (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). Participants David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Hawking, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey, Homer Simpson, and Kermit the Frog were defined as index cases. We included contacts up to the fifth generation seeded from each index case and enrolled a total of 99 participants into the cohort. Main outcome measures Basic reproduction number R(0), serial interval of accepting the challenge, and odds ratios of associated risk factors based on fully observed nomination chains; R(0 )is a measure of transmissibility and is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a single index in a fully susceptible population. Serial interval is the duration between onset of a primary case and onset of its secondary cases. Results Based on the empirical data and assuming a branching process we estimated a mean R(0) of 1.43 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.65) and a mean serial interval for accepting the challenge of 2.1 days (median 1 day). Higher log (base 10) net worth of the participants was positively associated with transmission (odds ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.50), adjusting for age and sex.

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) engages and regulates several innate immune response pathways during infection. We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV Papain-like Protease (PLpro) inhibits type I interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation thereby blocking downstream Interferon induction. This finding prompted us to identify other potential mechanisms of inhibition of PLpro on IFN induction. METHODS: We have used plasmids expressing PLpro and IRF3 including an IRF3 mutant that is constitutively active, called IRF3(5D). In these experiments we utilize transfections, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Electro-mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and protein localization to identify where IRF3 and IRF3(5D) are inhibited by PLpro. RESULTS: Here we show that PLpro also inhibits IRF3 activation at a step after phosphorylation and that this inhibition is dependent on the de-ubiquitination (DUB) activity of PLpro. We found that PLpro is able to block the type I IFN induction of a constitutively active IRF3, but does not inhibit IRF3 dimerization, nuclear localization or DNA binding. However, inhibition of PLpro\u2019s DUB activity by mutagenesis blocked the IRF3 inhibition activity of PLpro, suggesting a role for IRF3 ubiquitination in induction of a type I IFN innate immune response. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate an additional mechanism that PLpro is able to inhibit IRF3 signaling. These data suggest novel innate immune antagonism activities of PLpro that may contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matthews, Krystal; Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Pham, Alissa; Frieman, Matthew","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d71c2fa8fe1c3df75d031c50267993ede529b85c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4272517.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481026/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-014-0209-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IRF3 inhibition activity of PLpro","IRF3 phosphorylation","IRF3 ubiquitination","active IRF3","IRF3 dimerization","IRF3 activation","IRF3 mutant","IFN induction","novel innate immune antagonism activities of PLpro","type","SARS-CoV Papain","SARS-CoV pathogenesis","inhibition of PLpro\u2019s DUB activity","SARS coronavirus","downstream Interferon induction","innate immune response pathways","viral infection","potential mechanisms of inhibition","RESULTS","nuclear localization","protein localization","de-ubiquitination","complex interactions of viral","Electro-mobility Shift Assays","chromatin immunoprecipitation","mutagenesis","EMSA","transfections","data","Protease","role","DNA binding","additional mechanism","host factors","step","experiments","outcome","plasmids","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Studies in a wide range of ruminant and camelid species as well as mice have been instrumental in understanding BTV transmission, bluetongue (BT) pathogenicity/pathogenesis, viral virulence, the induced immune response, as well as reproductive failures associated with BTV infection. These studies have in many cases been complemented by in vitro studies with BTV in different cell types in tissue culture. Together these studies have formed the basis for the understanding of BTV-host interaction and have contributed to the design of successful control strategies, including the development of effective vaccines. This review describes some of the fundamental and contemporary infection studies that have been conducted with BTV in the mammalian host and provides an overview of the principal animal welfare issues that should be considered when designing experimental infection studies with BTV in in vivo infection models. Examples are provided from the authors\u2019 own laboratory where the three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) have been implemented in the design of experimental infection studies with BTV in mice and goats.

The prevalence of FCV in the general cat population is high, particularly in multi-cat households, largely because many clinically recovered cats remain persistently infected carriers. In order to assess how FCV circulates in such groups and to assess the contribution that each individual animal makes to the epidemiology of the disease, we have carried out the first detailed analysis of long-term shedding patterns of FCV in individual cats within naturally infected colonies. The prevalence of FCV in each of the groups on individual sampling occasions ranged from 0% to 91%, with averages for the individual colonies ranging from 6% to 75%. Within each of the colonies, one to three distinct strains of FCV were identified. Individual cats showed a spectrum of FCV shedding patterns over the sampling period which broadly grouped into three categories: those that shed virus relatively consistently, those that shed virus intermittently, and those that appeared never to shed virus. This is the first report identifying non-shedder cats that appear resistant to FCV infection over long periods of time, despite being continually exposed to virus. Such resistance appeared to be age related, which may have been immune-mediated, although by analogy with other caliciviruses, factors such as host genetic resistance may play a role. Given that a proportion of the population appears to be resistant to infection, clearly the cohort of cats that consistently shed virus are likely to provide an important mechanism whereby infection can be maintained in small populations.","publish_time":"2006-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coyne, Karen P.; Dawson, Susan; Radford, Alan D.; Cripps, Peter J.; Porter, Carol J.; McCracken, Christina M.; Gaskell, Rosalind M.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4da75cc7c725ecbb3445942719d450c92009a7e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117452.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506002598; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506002598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCV infection","individual cats","prevalence of FCV","spectrum of FCV","individual colonies","cohort of cats","distinct strains of FCV","individual animal","non-shedder cats","individual sampling occasions","detailed analysis of long-term shedding patterns of FCV","infected colonies","infectious respiratory pathogen of domestic cats","groups","general cat population","sampling period","genetic resistance","infected carriers","multi-cat households","long periods of time","factors","important mechanism","analogy","caliciviruses","epidemiology","report","Abstract Feline calicivirus","contribution","role","small populations","categories","averages","disease","proportion","order"],"language":"en"},

Weaning occurred when daily starter intake over 7 consecutive days averaged 0.5 kg. Maximum starter intake was restricted to 3 kg day\u22121, and grass hay was fed ad libitum.

Among the recently emerged respiratory pathogens are influenza viruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. As the genesis of these emerging viruses is not well understood and their detection normally occurs after they have crossed over and adapted to man, ideally, strategies for such novel virus detection should include intensive surveillance at the human\u2013animal interface, particularly if one believes the paradigm that many novel emerging zoonotic viruses first circulate in animal populations and occasionally infect man before they fully adapt to man; early detection at the human\u2013animal interface will provide earlier warning.

A shortage of respirators can be expected during a pandemic. The availability of surgical N95 FFRs can potentially be increased by incorporating FDA clearance requirements in the NIOSH respirator approval process. METHODS: Fluid resistance of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs, and FDA-cleared surgical N95 FFRs and surgical masks was tested using the ASTM F1862 method at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities and compared with the results from a third-party independent laboratory. Blood penetration through different layers of filter media of masks were also analyzed visually. RESULTS: Four N95 FFR models showed no test failures at both velocities. The penetration results obtained in the NIOSH laboratory were comparable to those from the third-party independent laboratory. The number of respirator samples failing the test increased with increasing test velocity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that several NIOSH-approved N95 FFR models would likely pass FD clearance requirements for resistance to synthetic blood penetration.","publish_time":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rengasamy, Samy; Sbarra, Deborah; Nwoko, Julian; Shaffer, Ronald","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35c4ec7bfafc2026179360780fafef283eea2c0a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3d6477a772e409fdc334edff10b17425fcd2ce85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4658509.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655315006975; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655315006975; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4658509?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231551/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.06.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institute","Food and Drug Administration","FDA","ASTM","FFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approved N95 FFRs","availability of surgical N95 FFRs","NIOSH laboratory","surgical masks","penetration results","NIOSH-approved N95 FFR models","Surgical N95 filtering facepiece respirators","Fluid resistance of NIOSH","NIOSH respirator approval process","FDA clearance requirements","third-party independent laboratory","test failures","synthetic blood penetration","FD clearance requirements","increasing test velocity","number of respirator samples","shortage of respirators","sec velocities","health care facilities","different layers of filter media of masks","sprays of body fluids","splashes","Occupational Safety","BACKGROUND","National Institute","Food","inhalation of infectious aerosols","Drug Administration","ASTM F1862 method","METHODS","pandemic","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

These can serve as guidelines in the search for new fusogens, and may allow the formulation of a cross-species, unified theory to explain divergent and convergent evolutionary principles of membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sapir, Amir; Avinoam, Ori; Podbilewicz, Benjamin; Chernomordik, Leonid V.","journal":"Developmental Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03d79b39835b3d457b8db177c5fc28c9439d35af.json; document_parses/pdf_json/11120cfe95eba8ddca85675bcafab4411835af82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3549671.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580707004856; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2007.12.008; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3549671?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1534580707004856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194649/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion reactions","convergent evolutionary principles of membrane fusion","common principles of action","fundamental requirement","unified theory","cross-species","pathological processes","limited number of viral","functions","proteins","eukaryotes","guidelines","search","diversity","structures","membranes","formulation"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we propose a structured academic outline allowing for the preservation of the academic vitality.

RECENT FINDINGS Currently, there is no structured framework for urology residency programs to adhere to in the face of a global pandemic or natural disaster. Urologic surgical emergencies arise and exceptional urologic care must continue to be provided. Despite lower surgical volumes and the inability for teams to meet in person, there are still robust opportunities for urologic surgical residents and faculty to maintain their surgical skills and mental sharpness. Changes within the medical field are already beginning to take shape, especially related to telehealth and virtual learning.

Restrictions due to notifiable epizootics complicate the exchange of samples in surveillance studies and suggest that laboratory capacities should be established domestically. Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) causes mainly enteric disease in cattle. Spillover to small ruminants is possible. Here we established BCoV serology based on a recombinant immunofluorescence assay for cattle, goats and sheep, and studied the seroprevalence of BCoV in these species in four different locations in the Greater Accra, Volta, Upper East, and Northern provinces of Ghana. The whole sampling and testing was organized and conducted by a veterinary school in Kumasi, Ashanti Region of Ghana. Among sampled sheep (n = 102), goats (n = 66), and cattle (n = 1495), the seroprevalence rates were 25.8 %, 43.1 % and 55.8 %. For cattle, seroprevalence was significantly higher on larger farms (82.2 % vs 17.8 %, comparing farms with \u003E50 or \u003C50 animals; p = 0.027). Highest prevalence was seen in the Northern province with dry climate, but no significant trend following the north-south gradient of sampling sites was detected. Our study identifies a considerable seroprevalence for BCoV in Ghana and provides further support for the spillover of BCoV to small ruminants in settings with mixed husbandry and limited separation between species.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burimuah, Vitus; Sylverken, Augustina; Owusu, Michael; El-Duah, Philip; Yeboah, Richmond; Lamptey, Jones; Frimpong, Yaw Oppong; Agbenyega, Olivia; Folitse, Raphael; Tasiame, William; Emikpe, Benjamin; Owiredu, Eddie-Williams; Oppong, Samuel; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Drosten, Christian","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a85682aca36d1cf089dc70545836c4a2485c93ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31928696/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519311502; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108544; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519311502","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["seroprevalence of BCoV","spillover of BCoV","goats","BCoV serology","Abstract Cattle","considerable seroprevalence","seroprevalence rates","small ruminants","Northern provinces of Ghana","sampled sheep","dominant livestock species","Ashanti Region of Ghana","limited information","limited separation","Highest prevalence","larger farms","prevalence of major infectious diseases","north-south gradient of sampling sites","mixed husbandry","settings","Upper East","sub-Saharan Africa","Greater Accra","Volta","recombinant immunofluorescence assay","significant trend","surveillance studies","exchange of samples","dry climate","Kumasi","different locations","notifiable epizootics","veterinary school","support","enteric disease","laboratory capacities","vs","study","Bovine Coronavirus","Restrictions","animals","testing"],"language":"en"},

The illegal trade in parrots and cockatoos poses a serious threat to the viability of native populations; in addition, species transported to non-endemic areas may potentially vector disease and genetically \u2018pollute\u2019 local native avifauna. To reduce the logistical difficulties associated with trafficking live birds, smugglers often transport eggs. This creates a problem for authorities in elucidating accurate species identification without the laborious task of incubation and hand rearing until a morphological identification can be made. Here, we use 99 avian eggs seized from carriers coming into and within Australia, as a result of suspected illegal trade. We investigate and evaluate the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to accurately identify eggs to family, genus or species level. However, Identification of a species based on percentage mtDNA similarities is difficult without good representations of the inter- and intra-levels of species variation. Based on the available reference database, we were able to identify 52% of the eggs to species level. Of those, 10 species from eight genera were detected, all of which belong to the parrot (Psittacidae) and cockatoo (Cacatuidae) families. Of the remaining 48%, a further 36% of eggs were identified to genus level, and 12% identified to family level using our assignment criteria. Clearly the lack of validated DNA reference sequences is hindering our ability to accurately assign a species identity, and accordingly, we advocate that more attention needs to be paid to establishing validated, multi locus mtDNA reference databases for exotic birds that can both assist in genetic identifications and withstand legal scrutiny.","publish_time":"2011-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coghlan, Megan L.; White, Nicole E.; Parkinson, Liza; Haile, James; Spencer, Peter B.S.; Bunce, Michael","journal":"Forensic Sci Int Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b222075493c559e2306167a6fae44b1611912992.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102845.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1872497311001323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497311001323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21741338/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsigen.2011.06.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["species level","species identity","elucidating accurate species identification","family level","genus level","avian eggs","intra-levels of species variation","exotic birds","charismatic birds","parrots","cockatoos","morphological identification","multi locus mtDNA reference databases","lack of validated DNA reference sequences","trafficking live birds","percentage mtDNA similarities","available reference database","use of mitochondrial DNA","result of suspected illegal trade","viability of native populations","local native avifauna","good representations","laborious task of incubation","hand rearing","addition","serious threat","assist","authorities","non-endemic areas","genetic identifications","disease","plumage","capacity","logistical difficulties","problem","smugglers","legal scrutiny","Psittacidae","Cacatuidae","learning","Australia","carriers","assignment criteria","families","Psittaciformes","pets","genera","attention"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: ITIS was used to measure cutaneous temperature in 1275 airline travellers who had agreed to tympanic temperature measurement and respiratory sampling. The prediction by ITIS of tympanic temperature (37.8\u00B0C and 37.5\u00B0C) and of influenza infection was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and estimated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). FINDINGS: Using front of face ITIS for prediction of tympanic temperature \u226537.8\u00B0C, the area under the ROC curve was 0.86 (95%CI 0.75\u20130.97) and setting sensitivity at 86% gave specificity of 71%. The PPV in this population of travellers, of whom 0.5% were febrile using this definition, was 1.5%. We identified influenza virus infection in 30 travellers (3 Type A and 27 Type B). For ITIS prediction of influenza infection the area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (0.56\u20130.75), a sensitivity of 87% gave specificity of 39%, and PPV of 2.8%. None of the 30 influenza-positive travellers had tympanic temperature \u226537.8\u00B0C at screening (95%CI 0% to 12%); three had no influenza symptoms. CONCLUSION: ITIS performed moderately well in detecting fever but in this study, during a seasonal epidemic of predominantly influenza type B, the proportion of influenza-infected travellers who were febrile was low and ITIS were not much better than chance at identifying travellers likely to be influenza-infected. Although febrile illness is more common in influenza A infections than influenza B infections, many influenza A infections are afebrile. Our findings therefore suggest that ITIS is unlikely to be effective for entry screening of travellers to detect influenza infection with the intention of preventing entry of the virus into a country.","publish_time":"2011-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Priest, Patricia C.; Duncan, Alasdair R.; Jennings, Lance C.; Baker, Michael G.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b936109e0b0de2cb59b2ed271614bb710e8e04af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3016318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245928/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPV","ITIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza-positive travellers","influenza-infected","proportion of influenza","ITIS prediction of influenza infection","influenza symptoms","influenza B infections","influenza type B","influenza virus infection","ITIS of tympanic temperature","infected travellers","airline travellers","face ITIS","population of travellers","entry screening of travellers","prediction of tympanic temperature","mass screening of travellers","tympanic temperature measurement","cutaneous temperature","specificity","PPV","ROC curve","area","estimated sensitivity","febrile illness","FINDINGS","positive predictive value","curves","Infrared thermal image scanners","Characteristic","attractive option","seasonal epidemic","Receiver","BACKGROUND","respiratory sampling","intention","published data","performance","airports","study","chance","country","fever","definition","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In the last few years, PED had a large economic impact on the swine industries in Asia and the US, and in 2014, the PEDV also re-emerged in Europe. Two main PEDV variants circulate worldwide but only the S INDEL variant, considered a mild strain, is spreading in Europe. To gain insights into the pathogenicity of this variant, its viral load and temporal shedding pattern were evaluated in piglets from infected farms. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the spike gene, was validated according to the minimum information for quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines. The qPCR was applied to longitudinal studies conducted in four swine farms naturally infected with the PEDV S INDEL variant. Clinical data, fecal swabs, and blood samples were collected from 103 piglets at 15\u201330-day intervals for 2\u20135 months. On all four farms, diarrhea was observed in sows during gestation and in farrowing units, and the mortality rates of piglets were 18, 25, 30, and 35%. Different clinical pictures (0-50% of diarrhea positivity), viral titer levels (mean 5.3-7.2 log(10) genome copies/mL), and antibody conditions (30-80% of positivity) were registered among sows on the four farms. The percentage of qPCR positive piglets varied greatly from the beginning (63\u2013100%) to the end (0%) of the infection course. Clinical signs were present in 96% of the qPCR positive animals. Viral loads ranged from 8.5 log(10) to 4 log(10) genome copies/mL in suckling pigs at 3\u20136 days of age and were not statistically different among farms, despite the different patterns observed in sows. After 2\u20133 weeks, only a few piglets still showed detectable viral levels and clinical signs, and they developed antibody responses. Moreover, co-infections with other pathogens and biosecurity procedures limiting the circulation of the virus could have influenced the severity of PED infection. QPCR and clinical data were useful in understanding the dynamics of PEDV infections and, therefore, in implementing appropriate control measures.","publish_time":"2016-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bertasio, Cristina; Giacomini, Enrico; Lazzaro, Massimiliano; Perulli, Simona; Papetti, Alice; Lavazza, Antonio; Lelli, Davide; Alborali, Giovanni; Boniotti, Maria B.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68c82e3e364e4f32d14a480538ccc8d0b5d5802c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5156881.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28018330/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.02009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED","PEDV","S INDEL","PEDV S INDEL","QPCR"],"locations":["Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["percentage of qPCR positive piglets","Clinical data","swine farms","Clinical signs","infected farms","mortality rates of piglets","diarrhea positivity","PEDV S INDEL variant","sows","log","Different clinical pictures","seronegative neonatal piglets","dynamics of PEDV infections","qPCR positive animals","watery diarrhea","Viral loads","detectable viral levels","viral titer levels","main PEDV variants","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","genome copies","different patterns","Europe","severity of PED infection","quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines","swine industries","co-infections","antibody responses","antibody conditions","infection course","high mortality rate","severe enteritis","large economic impact","temporal shedding pattern","minimum information","contagious enteric disease","pathogens","biosecurity procedures","farrowing units","fecal swabs","blood samples","mild strain","circulation","Asia","suckling pigs","gestation","longitudinal studies","years","pathogenicity","days of age","day intervals","spike gene","appropriate control measures","months","insights","beginning","weeks","end"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV infection causes acute lung injury (ALI) that may develop into life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with advanced age correlating positively with adverse disease outcome. The molecular pathways, however, that cause virus-induced ALI/ARDS in aged individuals are ill-defined. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques develop more severe pathology than young adult animals, even though viral replication levels are similar. Comprehensive genomic analyses indicate that aged macaques have a stronger host response to virus infection than young adult macaques, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, with NF-\u03BAB as central player, whereas expression of type I interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 is reduced. Therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques with type I IFN reduces pathology and diminishes pro-inflammatory gene expression, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels, without affecting virus replication in the lungs. Thus, ALI in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques developed as a result of an exacerbated innate host response. The anti-inflammatory action of type I IFN reveals a potential intervention strategy for virus-induced ALI.","publish_time":"2010-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smits, Saskia L.; de Lang, Anna; van den Brand, Judith M.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balachandar, Vellingiri; Mahalaxmi, Iyer; Devi, Subramaniam Mohana; Kaavya, Jayaramayya; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Laldinmawii, Gracy; Arul, Narayanasamy; Reddy, Subbarami Janardhana Kumar; Sivaprakash, Palanisamy; Kanchana, Sivaprakash; Vivekanandhan, Govindasamy; Cho, Ssang-Goo","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5218f4120ef849159cac52500c78104f5d092eab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325389?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360909/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325389","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","the Total Environment"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recovered patients","pathogenesis of COVID","possible outcome of COVID","possible mechanism of COVID","Longitudinal studies","follow-up studies","future","immunological studies","SARS-CoV","infection","novel Coronavirus disease","longitudinal analysis","confirmed cases","dreadful situation","global health emergency","necessary precautionary measures","World Health Organization","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","appropriate management","detection","comprehensive assessments","recommended guidelines","moral support","various aspects","drugs","Total Environment","society","development of vaccines","kinds of pandemics","article","Science","social realm","team","detrimental illnesses","counselling","information","life","larger cohort","after-effects","potential outbreaks","in-depth prognosis","characteristics","countries","normalcy"],"language":"en"},

A proper understanding of these animals\u2019 ecology is useful as a necessary input to plan strategies to control these populations. The present study addresses the population dynamics and the effectiveness of the sterilization of unrestricted dogs using capture and recapture procedures suitable for open animal populations. Every two months, over a period of 14 months, we captured, tagged, released and recaptured dogs in two regions in a city in the southeast region of Brazil. In one of these regions the animals were also sterilized. Both regions had similar social, environmental and demographic features. We estimated the presence of 148 females and 227 males during the period of study. The average dog:man ratio was 1 dog for each 42 and 51 human beings, in the areas without and with sterilization, respectively. The animal population size increased in both regions, due mainly to the abandonment of domestic dogs. Mortality rate decreased throughout the study period. Survival probabilities did not differ between genders, but males entered the population in higher numbers. There were no differences in abundance, survival and recruitment between the regions, indicating that sterilization did not affect the population dynamics. Our findings indicate that the observed animal dynamics were influenced by density-independent factors, and that sterilization might not be a viable and effective strategy in regions where availability of resources is low and animal abandonment rates are high. Furthermore, the high demographic turnover rates observed render the canine free-roaming population younger, thus more susceptible to diseases, especially to rabies and leishmaniasis. We conclude by stressing the importance of implementing educational programs to promote responsible animal ownership and effective strategies against abandonment practices.","publish_time":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belo, Vin\u00EDcius Silva; Struchiner, Claudio Jos\u00E9; Werneck, Guilherme Loureiro; Teixeira Neto, Rafael Gon\u00E7alves; Tonelli, Gabriel Barbosa; de Carvalho J\u00FAnior, Cl\u00F3vis Gomes; Ribeiro, Renata Aparecida Nascimento; da Silva, Eduardo S\u00E9rgio","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0cf5fb3ba91c15b0f93c584949fbc235f5b2d1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5665538.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29091961/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187233","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["regions","animal population size","population dynamics","animal abandonment rates","observed animal dynamics","animal welfare","roaming dogs","open animal populations","sterilization of unrestricted dogs","period of study","study period","responsible animal ownership","abandonment of domestic dogs","recaptured dogs","canine free-roaming population younger","effective strategies","abandonment practices","present study","months","high demographic turnover rates","effective strategy","existence of free","demographic features","average dog","Survival probabilities","recapture procedures suitable","important issues","availability of resources","animals\u2019 ecology","educational programs","city","effectiveness","necessary input","diseases","man ratio","recruitment","density-independent factors","genders","proper understanding","public health","southeast region of Brazil","rabies","differences","abundance","areas","females","Mortality rate","higher numbers","findings","human beings","leishmaniasis","importance","presence"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the presence of six virus families in bats in three regions of Central\u2010Southern Italy. Astroviruses were identified in seven of 13 bat species. Sequence analysis revealed marked genetic heterogeneity among the astroviruses identified, with nucleotide identity ranging between 60.26% and 87.62%. Astrovirus diversity was not associated with the bat species, the geographic areas or the bat colony, suggesting the circulation of several astrovirus strains in Italian ecosystems. Genetic diversification and interspecies transmission appear common in bat astroviruses and could provide, potentially, the bases for transmission to humans and other mammals. Yet overemphasizing this risk might have detrimental consequences for bat conservation and preservation of the important ecosystem services bats provide.","publish_time":"2018-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amoroso, Maria Grazia; Russo, Danilo; Lanave, Gianvito; Cistrone, Luca; Pratelli, Annamaria; Martella, Vito; Galiero, Giorgio; Decaro, Nicola; Fusco, Giovanna","journal":"Zoonoses Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dab1297089706b1f2ce25af936868f08d0d2ecc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165808.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29896884/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat astroviruses","bat species","bat conservation","bat colony","interspecies transmission","important ecosystem services bats","Genetic diversification","genetic heterogeneity","astrovirus strains","Astrovirus diversity","potential disseminators of zoonotic viruses","preservation","reservoirs","regions of Central","detrimental consequences","circulation","geographic areas","role","virus families","Italian ecosystems","Southern Italy","humans","Sequence analysis","questions","presence","risk","bases","mammals","nucleotide identity","recent years"],"language":"en"},

After treatment, the mean distance UCVA improved by a mean of 2.1 lines on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study logMAR chart. The mean contrast sensitivity improved over a range of spatial frequencies on sine-wave contrast sensitivity chart testing (1.5 to 18 cycles per degree). Follow-up data up to 12 months posttreatment showed that the gains were retained. Treatment did not alter refraction (mean spherical equivalent) or accommodative amplitudes.

Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the main pathogens associated with calf diarrhea. Although diarrhea is a symptom of infection with various pathogens, investigations to detect the types of pathogens have never been performed in Japan. This study investigated the prevalence of four major diarrhea-causing pathogens in calves: C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli K99). Commercial immunochromatography testing of all four pathogens and molecular analysis of C. parvum with diarrhea in calves from southernmost Okinawa and northernmost Hokkaido, Japan, were conducted. The frequencies of C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli (K99) in Okinawa were 50%, 28%, 2.3%, and 4.7%, respectively. Watery fecal stools were significantly correlated with C. parvum (p \u003C0.05). In oocyst calculations for C. parvum, no significant difference was observed between the single-infection cases and the mixed-infection cases with rotavirus. Interestingly, molecular analyses targeting small subunit ribosomal RNA as well as glycoprotein 60 (GP60) genes revealed that the C. parvum nucleotide sequences from the two prefectures were identical, indicating that C. parvum with a uniform characteristic is distributed throughout Japan. GP60 subtyping analysis identified C. parvum from Okinawa and Hokkaido as belonging to the IIaA15G2R1 subtype, a known zoonotic subtype. Hence, control of cryptosporidiosis is important not only for pre-weaned calves, but also for human health.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ichikawa-Seki, Madoka; Aita, Junya; Masatani, Tatsunori; Suzuki, Moemi; Nitta, Yoshiki; Tamayose, Genta; Iso, Takehiro; Suganuma, Keisuke; Fujiwara, Takashi; Matsuyama, Keita; Niikura, Tadamasa; Yokoyama, Naoaki; Suzuki, Hiroshi; Yamakawa, Kazuhiro; Inokuma, Hisashi; Itagaki, Tadashi; Zakimi, Satoshi; Nishikawa, Yoshifumi","journal":"Parasitology International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/225b622abc3a9d620cff32ffb50d0033472a2cf4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108262.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383576914001639; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383576914001639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481361/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2014.11.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan","Okinawa","Hokkaido"],"keyphrases":["Cryptosporidium parvum","parvum nucleotide sequences","main pathogens","various pathogens","types of pathogens","major diarrhea","rotavirus","calf diarrhea","Japan","neonatal calves","coli K99","Abstract Infectious diarrhea","mixed-infection cases","single-infection cases","southernmost Okinawa","pre-weaned calves","symptom of infection","molecular analysis of","coronavirus","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","GP60 subtyping analysis","molecular analyses","IIaA15G2R1 subtype","northernmost Hokkaido","known zoonotic subtype","small subunit ribosomal RNA","frequent cause of morbidity","glycoprotein","mortality","investigations","prefectures","genes","significant difference","Commercial immunochromatography testing","prevalence","uniform characteristic","control of cryptosporidiosis","human health","oocyst calculations","Watery fecal stools","study","frequencies of"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant SARS-CoV S1 antigen was produced and purified for the development of monoclonal and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies. The hybridomas secreting anti-S1 antibodies, F26G18 and P136.8D12, were fused respectively with the YP4 hybridoma to generate quadromas. The sandwich ELISA was formed by using F26G18 as a coating antibody and biotinylated F26G18 as a detection antibody with a detection limit of 0.037\u03BCg/ml (p \u003C0.02). The same detection limit was found with P136.8D12 as a coating antibody and biotinylated F26G18 as a detection antibody. The sensitivity was improved (detection limit of 0.019\u03BCg/ml), however, when using bi-specific monoclonal antibody (F157) as the detection antibody.

Surveys of T. gondii infection in wild birds have been reported extensively in the world, but little is known of T. gondii infection in peafowls worldwide. This study was performed to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in peafowls in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. METHODS: Sera from 277 peafowls, including 272 blue peafowls (Pavo cristatus) and 5 green peafowls (Pavo muticus) originated from two geographic areas in Yunnan Province were assayed for T. gondii antibodies using the modified agglutination test (MAT). RESULTS: Specific T. gondii antibodies were detected in 35 of 277 (12.64%) peafowls (MAT titer \u2265 1:5). Seropositive birds were found in both species, 33 in 272 blue peafowls and 2 in 5 green peafowls. There was no significant difference in T. gondii seroprevalence between the adolescent birds (6.74%) and the adult birds (6.67%) (P \u003E 0.05). The geographical origins of peafowls was found to be highly associated with T. gondii infection in the present study, a statistically significant difference in T. gondii seropositivity was observed between peafowls from Kunming (31.08%) and those from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture (5.91%) (OR = 10.956, 95% CI = 1.632-73.545, P = 0.014). Statistical analyses showed that there were no significant interactions between ages and geographical origins of peafowls (P \u003E 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present survey indicated that infection of peafowls with T. gondii is widespread in Yunnan Province, which has significant public health concerns and implications for prevention and control of toxoplamosis in this province.

Accumulated evidence shows that lycorine not only possesses strong pharmacological effects on many diseases, including anti-leukemia, anti-tumor, anti-angiogenesis, anti-virus, anti-bacteria, anti-inflammation, and antimalaria, but also exerts many other biological functions, such as inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and topoisomerase, suppression of ascorbic acid biosynthesis, and control of circadian period length.

The divergent chemical structures, multiple biological functions, and very low toxicity of lycorine imply that the agent is a potential drug candidate that warrants for further preclinical and clinic investigation.","publish_time":"2013-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, ZhiFei; Yang, Ping; Zhou, QuanSheng","journal":"Sci China Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74ac6fdff4da9fbbff90efb35909fcdc8ded0a15.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11426-013-4967-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-virus","anti-angiogenesis","anti-bacteria","anti-tumor","anti-leukemia","anti-inflammation","low toxicity of lycorine","multiple biological functions","numerous pharmacological effects","strong pharmacological effects","various diseases","divergent chemical structures","medicinal field","traditional Chinese medicinal herb","suppression of ascorbic acid biosynthesis","topoisomerase","amaryllidaceae family plant Lycoris","major active component","inhibition of acetylcholinesterase","agent","control of circadian period length","typical alkaloids","pyrrolophenanthridine nucleus core","potential drug candidate","antimalaria","clinic investigation","Accumulated evidence"],"language":"en"},

A genetic relative of the genus Clostridium, these morphologically unique bacteria display a replication and differentiation lifecycle initiated by epithelial tissue binding and filamentation. SFB intimately bind to the surface of absorptive intestinal epithelium without inducing an inflammatory response. Rather, their presence impacts the generation of innate and differentiation of acquired immunity, which impact the clearance of extracellular bacterial or fungal pathogens in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. SFB have recently garnered attention due to their role in promoting adaptive and innate immunity in mice and rats through the differentiation and maturation of Th17 cells in the intestinal tract and production of immunoglobulin A (IgA). SFB are the first commensal bacteria identified that impact the maturation and development of Th17 cells in mice. Recently, microbiome studies have revealed the presence of Candidatus Arthromitus (occasionally designated as Candidatus Savagella), a proposed candidate species of SFB, in higher proportions in higher-performing flocks as compared to matched lower-performing flocks, suggesting that SFB may serve to establish a healthy gut and protect commercial turkeys from pathogens resulting in morbidity and decreased performance. In this review we seek to describe the life cycle, host specificity, and genetic capabilities of SFB, such as bacterial metabolism, and how these factors influence the host immunity and microbiome. Although the role of SFB to induce antigen-specific Th17 cells in poultry is unknown, they may play an important role in modulating the immune response in the intestinal tract to promote resistance against some infectious diseases and promote food-safety. This review demonstrates the importance of studying and further characterizing commensal, host-specific bacteria in food-producing animals and their importance to animal health.","publish_time":"2018-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedblom, Grant A.; Reiland, Holly A.; Sylte, Matthew J.; Johnson, Timothy J.; Baumler, David J.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/812cc3ff2d36c2d370f943c6fd0d2d45b918296e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6117376.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197636/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01991","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of SFB","genetic capabilities of SFB","commensal bacteria","host immunity","host-specific bacteria","proposed candidate species of SFB","maturation of Th17 cells","intestinal tract","unique bacteria","host specificity","group of host","innate immunity","development of Th17 cells","antigen-specific Th17 cells","differentiation lifecycle","characterizing commensal","Segmented filamentous bacteria","flocks","mice","commensal organisms","importance","important role","review","surface of absorptive intestinal epithelium","presence of Candidatus Arthromitus","fungal pathogens","higher proportions","Candidatus Savagella","immune response","bacterial metabolism","inflammatory response","generation of innate","food-safety","microbiome studies","ileal epithelium of vertebrate","clearance of extracellular bacterial","animals","epithelial tissue binding","morbidity","commercial turkeys","genus Clostridium","replication","poultry","factors","rats","infectious diseases","production of immunoglobulin","invertebrate hosts","healthy gut","resistance","life cycle","respiratory tracts","filamentation","animal health","decreased performance","garnered attention","IgA"],"language":"en"},

Sia come in a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the C-7, C-8, and C-9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. Since Sia or their variant forms are receptors for influenza A, B, C, and D viruses, we examined the effects of these modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and canines. Although they were expressed on the cell surfaces of canine MDCK cell lines, they were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1 to 2% of total Sia in these cell lines. We knocked out and overexpressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1) and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl Sia expression, confirming previous reports. However, overexpression of CasD1 and knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C and D infection but had no obvious effect on influenza A and B infection.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnard, Karen N.; Wasik, Brian R.; LaClair, Justin R.; Buchholz, David W.; Weichert, Wendy S.; Alford-Lawrence, Brynn K.; Aguilar, Hector C.; Parrish, Colin R.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2448743a5de075f6a1816e46fe72b69cc791da18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6890989.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02490-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31796537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sia"],"organizations":["MDCK","SIAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetyl levels","acetyl modifications","O-acetyl Sia expression","influenza C","total Sia","sialate O-acetylesterase gene","sialate O-acetyltransferase gene","canine cells","surfaces of cells","cell surfaces of canine MDCK cell lines","A549 cells","modified forms","D infection","B infection","overexpression of CasD1","low levels","knockout of SIAE","different human","D viruses","variant forms","Golgi compartment of human HEK","obvious effect","CRISPR","effects","receptors","change","modest increases","previous reports","Cas9 editing","virus infections","humans","canines","variety","complex regulations","Sialic acids","tissues","distribution","positions"],"language":"en"},

TGEV is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes highly fatal acute diarrhoea in newborn pigs. An oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine against anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus developed in our laboratory was used to study mucosal immune responses. In this L. casei vaccine, repetitive peptides expressed by L. casei (specifically the MDP and tuftsin fusion protein (MT)) were repeated 20 times and the D antigenic site of the TGEV spike (S) protein was repeated 6 times. Immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus is crucial for investigations of the effect of immunization, such as the first immunization time and dose. The first immunization is more important than the last immunization in the series. The recombinant Lactobacillus elicited specific systemic and mucosal immune responses. Recombinant L. casei had a strong potentiating effect on the cellular immunity induced by the oral L. casei vaccine. However, during TGEV infection, the systemic and local immune responses switched from Th1 to Th2-based immune responses. The systemic humoral immune response was stronger than the cellular immune response after TGEV infection. We found that the recombinant Lactobacillus stimulated IL-17 expression in both the systemic and mucosal immune responses against TGEV infection. Furthermore, the Lactobacillus vaccine stimulated an anti-TGEV infection Th17 pathway. The histopathological examination showed tremendous potential for recombinant Lactobacillus to enable rapid and effective treatment for TGEV with an intestinal tropism in piglets. The TGEV immune protection was primarily dependent on mucosal immunity.","publish_time":"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Xinpeng; Hou, Xingyu; Tang, Lijie; Jiang, Yanping; Ma, Guangpeng; Li, Yijing","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/281fd5c29156a80cab2f647142f635712680a58d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080089.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7424-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27020282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","MDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV immune protection","mucosal immune responses","TGEV spike","Lactobacillus vaccine","casei vaccine","local immune responses","oral Lactobacillus casei","cellular immune response","systemic humoral immune response","recombinant Lactobacillus stimulated IL","effect of immunization","anti-TGEV infection Th17 pathway","mucosal immunity","immunization time","Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","cellular immunity","genus Coronavirus","enteropathogenic coronavirus","times","anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus","strong potentiating effect","tuftsin fusion protein","effective treatment","fatal acute diarrhoea","expression","family Coronaviridae","tremendous potential","D antigenic site","MT","MDP","member","laboratory","investigations","Th2","order Nidovirales","intestinal tropism","histopathological examination","newborn pigs","repetitive peptides","piglets","dose","series"],"language":"en"},

We employed cDNA microarray analysis to characterize the cellular transcriptional responses of homologous human genes at 12 h post-infection. Seventy mRNA transcripts belonging to various functional classes exhibited significant alterations in gene expression. There was considerable induction of heat shock proteins that are crucial to the immune response mechanism. Modified levels of several transcripts involved in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes exemplified the balance between opposing forces during SARS pathogenesis. Other genes displaying altered transcription included those associated with host translation, cellular metabolism, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, protein trafficking, protein modulators, and cytoskeletal proteins. Alterations in the levels of several novel transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins and expressed sequence tags were also identified. In addition, transcription of apoptosis-related genes DENN and hIAP1 was upregulated in contrast to FAIM. Elevated Mx1 expression signified a strong host response to mediate antiviral resistance. Also expressed in infected cells was the C-terminal alternative splice variant of the p53 tumor suppressor gene encoding a modified truncated protein that can influence the activity of wild-type p53. We observed the interplay between various mechanisms to favor virus multiplication before full-blown apoptosis and the triggering of several pathways in host cells in an attempt to eliminate the pathogen. Microarray analysis identifies the critical host\u2013pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV infection and provides new insights into the pathophysiology of SARS.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leong, W.

In RV infection, jaundice is often reported, but the relationship between jaundice and RV infection has not been studied. This study aimed to determine the importance of asymptomatic RV screening in neonates with jaundice. METHODS: Neonates from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Chonbuk National University Hospital, those transferred from local obstetrics and gynecology hospitals and outpatient clinics were selected from 2014 to 2017. The study included only infants aged between 3 and 28 days. Jaundice was defined according to gestational age and birth age, in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines criteria. RV infection was confirmed by a stool test, and RV screening and laboratory tests were performed at admission. RESULTS: Among 596 patients, 166 patients had jaundice. RV infection was observed in 70 (42%) jaundice patients. There were 36 (22%) jaundice patients with asymptomatic RV infection. Patients with onset of jaundice 3\u20137 days after birth had a high incidence of RV infection. When the RV test was positive, the risk of jaundice was significantly high [odds ratio (OR) 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20\u20132.98; p = 0.006]. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with the onset of jaundice \u003E 3 days after birth were likely to have RV infection. Therefore, we suggest that screening tests for RV infection be included as part of the evaluation of jaundiced infants presenting to NICU.

Rapid and accurate testing at the point-of-need (PON) supports prevention of virus spread and management of clinical disease. This study evaluated the performance of an insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) that detects proviral DNA, and a reverse transcription (RT)-iiPCR that detects both viral RNA and proviral DNA, for FeLV detection at the PON. METHODS: Mycoplasma haemofelis, feline coronavirus, feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus and feline immunodeficiency virus were used to test analytical specificity. In vitro transcribed RNA, artificial plasmid, FeLV strain American Type Culture Collection VR-719 and a clinical FeLV isolate were used in the analytical sensitivity assays. A retrospective study including 116 clinical plasma and serum samples that had been tested with virus isolation, real-time PCR and ELISA, and a prospective study including 150 clinical plasma and serum samples were implemented to evaluate the clinical performances of the iiPCR-based methods for FeLV detection. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent assay limit of detection was calculated to be 16 RNA and five DNA copies for the RT-iiPCR, and six DNA copies for the iiPCR. Both reactions had analytical sensitivity comparable to a reference real-time PCR (qPCR) and did not detect five non-target feline pathogens. The clinical performance of the RT-iiPCR and iiPCR had 98.82% agreement (kappa[\u03BA] = 0.97) and 100% agreement (\u03BA = 1.0), respectively, with the qPCR (n = 85).

We aimed to assess the infection control in our animal laboratory and evaluate the disinfectant effects of a portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) machine. Samples were taken from the surface of research tables, other high touch places, such as doorknobs, weighing scales, and handles of trolleys, and from air in the barrier system pre- and post-manual cleaning and post-PX-UV disinfection. The bacteria types were identified. We found that routine manual cleaning significantly reduced bacterial colony form unit (CFU)/cm2 (P = .02), and the median of CFU/cm2 reduced from 0.5 pre-cleaning to zero post-cleaning. PX-UV disinfection also significantly reduced residual bacterial counts (P = .002), with the highest counts 10 pre-PX-UV disinfection and 1 afterwards. Without manual cleaning, PX-UV disinfected surfaces significantly (P \u003C .001), median count 6 pre-PX-UV disinfection and zero afterwards. PX-UV significantly reduced bacterial colony counts in the air with the median count falling from 6 to zero (P \u003C .001). Some of the 21 species of pathogens we identified in the current study are pathogenic, resistant to antibiotics, and able to cause nosocomial infections and zoonosis. PX-UV reduced counts of most of the pathogens. PX-UV is an effective agent against these pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jing-Jing; Wang, Shan-Ni; Qiao, Jiao-Jiao; Chen, Li-Hua; Li, Yu; Wu, Yong; Ding, Yan-Xia; Wang, Mei-Mei; Tian, Yun; Liu, Yun-Bo; Yan, Chen; Zhang, Chen; Gao, Chang-Qing","journal":"Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ef25210c5c83a6137d26c8b469d8058dfe4ebdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7136868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278270/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.111869; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S101113442030316X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S101113442030316X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-PX-UV disinfection","post-PX-UV disinfection","PX-UV disinfected surfaces","pre-cleaning","post-cleaning","post-manual cleaning","routine manual cleaning","residual bacterial counts","median of CFU","median count","highest counts","barrier system pre-","animal laboratory","air","cm2","species of pathogens","bacterial colony form unit","possible cause of cross infection","infection control","portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet","disinfectant effects","teaching hospital","high touch places","antibiotics","surface of research tables","current study","doorknobs","effective agent","nosocomial infections","zoonosis","machine","scales","trolleys","bacteria types","Samples"],"language":"en"},

The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Mahadev, Srihari; Schwartz, Robert E; Shah, Shawn; Sampath, Kartik; Schnoll-Sussman, Felice; Brown Jr, Robert S; Carr-Locke, David; Cohen, David E; Sharaiha, Reem Z","journal":"World J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f323f248904a03a146e6e40525ae0867478f207.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167410.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i14.1546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","GI symptoms","infected patients","reported GI manifestation of COVID","respiratory samples","direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","coronavirus disease","pandemic","case of acute liver failure","liver enzymes","liver injury","treatment of COVID","fecal RNA testing","available literature","fecal shedding","available reports","RNA analysis","number of cases","high risk","differential diagnosis","peak","N95 respirators","additional protective equipment","extreme burden","non-urgent endoscopic procedures","involvement","health care systems","moderate elevation","endoscopy","complications","gastroenterology","infection","hepatology consultants","useful diagnostic test","medications","diarrhea","immediate future","individuals","half"],"language":"en"},

Studying infectious disease among hosts (animals and humans), outside of the context of their environment, ignores the complexity in which hosts interact. We aimed to formulate a framework to study the effect of large livestock movement on the ecology of emerging zoonotic infectious disease in low-income and middle-income countries. Ultimately such a framework could identify points of intervention in livestock movement chains to reduce the risk of emerging diseases. As a test case, we use camel movement and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods We reviewed grey and peer-reviewed literature on camel husbandry and interviewed key stakeholders in Egypt and Ethiopia involved in public health research, animal husbandry, the camel trade, veterinary services for camels, and physicians. A multidisciplinary team consisting of wildlife biologists, anthropologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, geographers, modellers, virologists, and health-care professionals from the USA, Egypt, and Ethiopia was assembled to propose the framework. Findings A framework has been developed which highlights the associations between the complex linkages within the broader ecosystem: environment (flora, climate, pollution), animals (distribution and density of animals, interaction between humans, domesticated and wildlife animals), and human behavioural systems (socio-cultural and economic structures around animal husbandry and hunting, connectivity including market trade systems). Interpretation While there is an emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation in the area of one health, this type of work has several challenges. A history of interdisciplinary work in zoonotic infectious disease is limited, in part, because of the lack of undergraduate and graduate curricula that provide training. Additionally the large teams required to conduct truly interdisciplinary work require sustained funding and such opportunities are rare.

There is large global variation in epidemiology, clinical management and outcomes, including mortality. We performed a short period observational data collection in critical care units distributed globally during regional peak SARI seasons from 1 January 2016 until 31 August 2017, using standardised data collection tools. Data were collected for 1 week on all admitted patients who met the inclusion criteria for SARI, with follow-up to hospital discharge. Proportions of patients across regions were compared for microbiology, management strategies and outcomes. Regions were divided geographically and economically according to World Bank definitions. Data were collected for 682 patients from 95 hospitals and 23 countries. The overall mortality was 9.5%. Of the patients, 21.7% were children, with case fatality proportions of 1% for those less than 5 years. The highest mortality was in those above 60 years, at 18.6%. Case fatality varied by region: East Asia and Pacific 10.2% (21 of 206), Sub-Saharan Africa 4.3% (8 of 188), South Asia 0% (0 of 35), North America 13.6% (25 of 184), and Europe and Central Asia 14.3% (9 of 63). Mortality in low-income and low-middle-income countries combined was 4% as compared with 14% in high-income countries. Organ dysfunction scores calculated on presentation in 560 patients where full data were available revealed Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores on presentation were significantly associated with mortality and hospital length of stay. Patients in East Asia and Pacific (48%) and North America (24%) had the highest SOFA scores of \u003E12. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that initial SOFA score and age were independent predictors of hospital survival. There was variability across regions and income groupings for the critical care management and outcomes of SARI. Intensive care unit-specific factors, geography and management features were less reliable than baseline severity for predicting ultimate outcome.

One hundred seventy-five (175) programs were presented with a seven-item questionnaire addressing whether each program is using telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 175 Electronic Residency Application Service participant orthopaedic programs, 168 responded for a total response rate of 96%. Of the 106 institutions using telehealth services, 88 (83%) cited the COVID-19 pandemic as the impetus for implementation of telehealth services.

In most healthy children, respiratory viruses are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and are not accompanied by significant morbidity. In immunocompromised hosts, including hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and oncology patients, respiratory viruses can be associated with significant clinical manifestations, including prolonged viral shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. This chapter reviews the major respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Other viruses can manifest as pulmonary infection; however, these viruses are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 17 for discussion of cytomegalovirus and Chapter 22 for discussion of adenoviruses).","publish_time":"2021-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waghmare, Alpana; Englund, Janet A.","journal":"Pediatric Transplant and Oncology Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/224fba9bf09ca0e8abd730f44da3b6808cf632f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182252.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323641982000300; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323641982000300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major respiratory viruses","parainfluenza viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","chapter","lower respiratory tract disease","self-limited upper respiratory tract infections","human metapneumovirus","human rhinoviruses","human coronaviruses","immunocompromised children","healthy children","solid organ transplant recipients","hematopoietic cell transplant recipients","immunocompromised hosts","discussion of cytomegalovirus","significant morbidity","discussion of adenoviruses","significant clinical manifestations","prolonged viral shedding","need","supplemental oxygen","oncology patients","late airflow obstruction","death","pulmonary infection"],"language":"en"},

In 2004, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Kenya (CDC Kenya) established the Global Disease Detection Division of which one core component was to support, with other partners, the One Health approach to public health science. After catalytic events such as the global expansion of highly pathogenic H5N1 and the 2006 East African multi-country outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, CDC Kenya supported key Kenya government institutions including the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries to establish a framework for multi-sectoral collaboration at national and county level and a coordination office referred to as the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU). The ZDU has provided Kenya with an institutional framework to highlight the public health importance of endemic and epidemic zoonoses including RVF, rabies, brucellosis, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, anthrax and other emerging issues such as anti-microbial resistance through capacity building programs, surveillance, workforce development, research, coordinated investigation and outbreak response. This has led to improved outbreak response, and generated data (including discovery of new pathogens) that has informed disease control programs to reduce burden of and enhance preparedness for endemic and epidemic zoonotic diseases, thereby enhancing global health security. Since 2014, the Global Health Security Agenda implemented through CDC Kenya and other partners in the country has provided additional impetus to maintain this effort and Kenya\u2019s achievement now serves as a model for other countries in the region.

To construct the chicken MHC class I peptide tetramer, genes of the chicken MHC-I \u03B1 chain (BF2*15) and \u03B22 microglobulin (Ch\u03B22m) were synthesized by RT-PCR from the total RNA of PBMCs and the signal sequences were deleted. The BF2*15 was then fused with the BirA substrate peptide (BSP) sequence at the C terminus. Next, the synthesized PCR products of BF2*15 and Ch\u03B22m were cloned into the expression vector pET-28a (\u002B) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Highly purified BF2*15-BSP heavy chain and Ch\u03B22m were obtained by a Ni2\u002B NTA column affinity purification, yielding approximately 1.6mg of BF2*15-BSP and 2.4mg of Ch\u03B22m per 1g of the pelleted bacteria. The purified BF2*15-BSP heavy chain and Ch\u03B22m were refolded with synthetic peptide originated from infectious bronchitis virus nucleoprotein (IBV N71\u201378) in refolding buffer to generate the monomer of BF2*15/peptide complex. The monomer was then biotinylated and tetramerized using PE-labeled streptavidin. Upon functional evaluation of the construct by using flowcytometry, we observed that 3.65% of CTLs were specific to IBV nucleoprotein.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. RESULTS: In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. CONCLUSION: Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases.

This study investigated the inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids and substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases. Allantoin, dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, acetohydroxamate, orotic acid, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole could slightly inhibit dihydropyrimidinase, and the IC(50) values of these compounds were within the millimolar range. The inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids, such as myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, galangin, dihydromyricetin, and myricitrin, was also investigated.

Although the inhibitory effects of these flavonoids on dihydropyrimidinase were substrate-dependent, dihydromyricetin significantly inhibited dihydropyrimidinase with IC(50) values of 48 and 40 \u03BCM for the substrates dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin, respectively. The results from the Lineweaver\u2212Burk plot indicated that dihydromyricetin was a competitive inhibitor. Results from fluorescence quenching analysis indicated that dihydromyricetin could form a stable complex with dihydropyrimidinase with the K (d) value of 22.6 \u03BCM. A structural study using PatchDock showed that dihydromyricetin was docked in the active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase, which was consistent with the findings from kinetic and fluorescence studies. This study was the first to demonstrate that naturally occurring product dihydromyricetin inhibited dihydropyrimidinase, even more than the substrate analogs (\u003E3 orders of magnitude). These flavonols, particularly myricetin, may serve as drug leads and dirty drugs (for multiple targets) for designing compounds that target several cyclic amidohydrolases.","publish_time":"2015-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Cheng-Yang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5af7319ee1fd5e9cc3cf8c5836b19a408ac519b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4437985.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993634/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127634","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase","product dihydromyricetin inhibited dihydropyrimidinase","active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase","cyclic amidohydrolases","flavonoids","compounds","substrates dihydrouracil","cyclic amidohydrolase family","inhibitors of allantoinase","results","\u03BCM","dihydroorotase","values","structural study","hydantoin acetic acid","similar active sites","orotic acid","substrate-dependent","propyl-hydantoin","substrate analogs","similar mechanism","fluorescence studies","fluorescence quenching analysis","dirty drugs","acetohydroxamate","galangin","quercetin","drug leads","multiple targets","Burk plot","findings","dihydroorotate","Lineweaver","kaempferol","member","hydantoinase","metalloenzymes","PatchDock","inhibitory effects","stable complex","orders of magnitude","competitive inhibitor","imidase","catalysis","millimolar range","myricitrin","triazole","flavonols"],"language":"en"},

The present study demonstrated that N protein in the MHV virion nucleocapsid and in the intracellular genome-length RNP complex that bound to viral envelope M protein was tightly self-associated such that its association was retained even after extensive RNase A-treatment of the RNP complexes. The RNase A-resistant tight N protein association in the virion nucleocapsid was not mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bridge between N proteins. In contrast, N protein association in the majority of the intracellular RNP complexes was susceptible to RNase A-treatment.

The aims of this mixed-methods review were to identify: i) key dimensions of wellbeing and ii) wellbeing measures that align to these dimensions among YPLHIV (15\u201324 years) in SSA. We searched six social science and medical databases, including grey literature. We included studies that examined correlates and lived experiences of wellbeing, among YPLHIV in SSA, from January 2000 to May 2019. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts and assessed methodological quality of included articles. We analysed quantitative and qualitative data using descriptive and meta-ethnographic approaches, respectively. Thereafter, we integrated findings using a framework approach. We identified 6527 citations. Of these, 10 quantitative and 30 qualitative studies were included. Being male, higher educational status, less stigma and more social support were likely correlates of wellbeing. Themes that shaped experiences suggestive of wellbeing were: 1) acceptance and belonging\u2014 stigma, social support; 2) coping; 3) standard of living. Our final synthesis found that the following dimensions potentially characterise wellbeing: self-acceptance, belonging, autonomy; positive relations, environmental mastery, purpose in life. Wellbeing for YPLHIV is multi-dimensional and relational. Relevant measures include the Personal Wellbeing Index, Ryff\u2019s Psychological Wellbeing Scale and Mental Health Continuum Short Form. However, psychometric evaluations of these scales among YPLHIV in SSA are needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Govindasamy, Darshini; Seeley, Janet; Olaru, Ioana D.; Wiyeh, Alison; Mathews, Catherine; Ferrari, Giulia","journal":"Health Qual Life Outcomes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/885a80c01cf3c97a7ebc9d63b21afec2eda77a4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370772/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-020-01352-w","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wellbeing measures","experiences of wellbeing","YPLHIV","key dimensions of wellbeing","experiences suggestive of wellbeing","Personal Wellbeing Index","SSA","Ryff\u2019s Psychological Wellbeing Scale","social support","following dimensions","stigma","social science","Relevant measures","qualitative studies","correlates","methodological quality of included articles","poor quality of life","AIDS policies","qualitative data","self-acceptance","standard of living","Mental Health Continuum Short Form","environmental mastery","autonomy","texts","positive relations","purpose","medical databases","meta-ethnographic approaches","high risk","higher educational status","sub-Saharan Africa","coping","scales","screened abstracts","grey literature","mitigation efforts","aims","mixed-methods review","reviewers","final synthesis","psychometric evaluations","Young people","Themes","guidance","findings","framework approach","years","citations"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2009 to January 2010, a total of 17 patients with confirmed H1N1 infection were included in the study (mean age 30.7 years). All patients were managed as outpatients or required short hospitalization without ventilation assistance. The CT scans were assessed for the presence of nodules, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, reticulation, effusion, and lymph node enlargement. Location and distribution were evaluated. RESULTS: The most frequent manifestation was a mixture of nodules, consolidation, and GGO (5/17, 29.4%). In one case there was a focal area of bronchiolitis (centrilobular nodules with tree-in-bud appearance), and 10 of 17 cases (58.8%) showed bronchial wall thickening (findings of bronchitis/peribronchitis) and/or other abnormalities. In 16 of the 17 cases (94.1%) there were CT abnormalities with bilateral and random distribution without zonal predominance. Pleural effusions were seen in eight cases (47.1%). CONCLUSION: In contrast to several reports so far, CT findings of H1N1 virus infection in patients with mild illness are variable, including suggestive findings of inflammation involving large and/or small airways. This study showed various CT findings overlapping with other viral, atypical, or bacterial pneumonia and even cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Su Young; Kim, Jeung Sook; Park, Chan Sup","journal":"Jpn J Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/889faf1c8a83aca6d0eca3d9878b5aa7698d6b75.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21717297/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-010-0558-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various CT findings","CT findings of H1N1 virus infection","CT abnormalities","findings of bronchitis","CT scans","cases","suggestive findings of inflammation","confirmed H1N1 infection","presence of nodules","centrilobular nodules","bronchial wall thickening","mixture of nodules","consolidation","mild illness","GGO","study","bacterial pneumonia","random distribution","cryptogenic organizing pneumonia","reticulation","ground glass opacity","tree","focal area of bronchiolitis","short hospitalization","zonal predominance","frequent manifestation","outpatients","peribronchitis","reports","computed tomography","lymph node enlargement","ventilation assistance","mean age","years","total","small airways","bud appearance","CONCLUSION","contrast","RESULTS","Pleural effusions","MATERIALS","METHODS","PURPOSE","Location"],"language":"en"},

Together, the genetic and biochemical data indicate that CTF13 is an essential kinetochore protein.","publish_time":"1993-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doheny, Kimberly Floy; Sorger, Peter K.; Hyman, Anthony A.; Tugendreich, Stuart; Spencer, Forrest; Hieter, Philip","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36d81dfe6a86cf8bfe344eeb9fdf0dc32c40894c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286749390255O; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/009286749390255O","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CTF13 protein","essential kinetochore protein","essential gene","putative kinetochore mutants","assays of kinetochore integrity","ctf13 mutants missegregate chromosomes","CEN DNA-protein complex","amino acid protein","kd kinetochore component","ctf14","nonpermissive temperature","G2 DNA content","large-budded cells","electrophoretic mobility","mitotic stability","NDC10 CBF2","transcription block","dicentric test chromosome","short spindle","homology","biochemical data","relaxation","centromeres","increase","cerevisiae","Antibodies","epitope","proteins"],"language":"en"},

Conditions used for cell isolation and expansion should meet strict quality and safety requirements. This is particularly true for the growth medium used for MSC isolation and expansion. Basal growth media used for MSC expansion are supplemented with multiple nutrients and growth factors. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has long been the gold standard medium supplement for laboratory-scale MSC culture. However, FBS has a poorly characterized composition and poses risk factors, as it may be a source of xenogenic antigens and zoonotic infections. FBS has therefore become undesirable as a growth medium supplement for isolating and expanding MSCs for human therapy protocols. In recent years, human blood materials, and most particularly lysates and releasates of platelet concentrates have emerged as efficient medium supplements for isolating and expanding MSCs from various origins. This review analyzes the advantages and limits of using human platelet materials as medium supplements for MSC isolation and expansion. We present the modes of production of allogeneic and autologous platelet concentrates, measures taken to ensure optimal pathogen safety profiles, and methods of preparing PLs for MSC expansion. We also discuss the supply of such blood preparations. Produced under optimal conditions of standardization and safety, human platelet materials can become the future \u2018gold standard\u2019 supplement for ex vivo production of MSCs for translational medicine and cell therapy applications.","publish_time":"2015-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shih, Daniel Tzu-Bi; Burnouf, Thierry","journal":"N Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cd18a394a1ab05d7f574241ccb09775f6851222.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102808.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871678414006724; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678414006724; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2014.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSC","FBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MSC expansion","MSC isolation","human platelet materials","growth medium supplement","cell isolation","human blood materials","production of MSCs","gold standard medium supplement","cell therapy applications","human therapy protocols","growth factors","FBS","efficient medium supplements","phase of isolation","autologous platelet concentrates","releasates of platelet concentrates","laboratory-scale MSC culture","safety requirements","meaningful cell number","Basal growth media","optimal pathogen safety profiles","clinical applications of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells","optimal conditions of standardization","regenerative medicine","translational medicine","modes of production","risk factors","blood preparations","measures","methods","treatment of immune","tissue engineering","future","strict quality","inflammatory diseases","lysates","limits","multiple nutrients","source of xenogenic antigens","zoonotic infections","characterized composition","advantages","PLs","recent years","Fetal bovine serum","review","supply","various origins"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are no targeted therapeutics against this debilitating virus. One approach to develop potential therapeutics is by understanding the viral-host interactions.

The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a triage policy and risk-stratified infection control measures in preventing nosocomial SARS infection among paediatric healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Prince of Wales Hospital, a general hospital to which children with SARS are referred in Hong Kong. The acute paediatric wards were stratified into three areas: (1) ultra high-risk area, (2) high-risk area and (3) moderate-risk area according to different risk levels of nosocomial SARS transmission. The implementation of different levels of infection control precautions was guided by this risk stratification strategy. Between 13 March and 23 June, 38 patients with probable and suspected SARS, 90 patients with non-SARS pneumonia, and 510 patients without pneumonia were admitted into our unit. All probable SARS cases were isolated in negative-pressure rooms. Twenty-six HCWs worked in the ultra high-risk area caring for SARS patients and 88 HCWs managed non-SARS patients in other ward areas. None of the HCWs developed clinical features suggestive of SARS. In addition, there was no nosocomial spread of SARS-associated coronavirus to other patients or visitors during this period. In conclusion, stringent infection control precautions, appropriate triage and prompt isolation of potential SARS patients may have contributed to a lack of nosocomial spread and HCW acquisition of SARS in our unit.","publish_time":"2004-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, T.

To understand the molecular basis of coronavirus attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, we determined cryo-EM structures of coronavirus OC43 S glycoprotein trimer in isolation and in complex with a 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. We demonstrate that the ligand binds with fast kinetics to a surface-exposed groove and interactions at the identified site are essential for S-mediated viral entry into host cells, but free monosaccharide did not trigger fusogenic conformational changes. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins that engage 9-O-acetyl-sialogycans, with an architecture similar to the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus hemagglutinin esterases and influenza virus C/D hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoproteins.

Without institutionalizing the lessons learned, the US will be positioned to repeat the missteps of COVID-19 with the next pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bearman, Gonzalo; Pryor, Rachel; Vokes, Rebecca; Cooper, Kaila; Doll, Michelle; Godbout, Emily J.; Stevens, Michael P.","journal":"International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56e31caefeb075de5682938017ee6f936a261ad0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303660; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303660?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445697/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["US healthcare delivery model","pandemic","infectious diseases emergencies","scarcity of infectious diseases physicians","missteps of COVID","market failure of vaccines","anti-infectives","defunding of public health","future responses","structural barriers","little evidence of better","concept of American exceptionalism","country","outcomes","United States","lessons"],"language":"en"},

Asthma is a complex genetic disorder with strong environmental influence. It imposes a growing burden on our society in terms of morbidity, quality of life, and healthcare costs. Despite large\u2010scale efforts, only a few asthma genes have been confirmed, suggesting that the genetic underpinning of asthma is highly complex. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed regarding atopic and nonatopic asthma risk factors, including environmental risk factors and genetic studies in adults and children. RESULTS: Several environmental risk factors have been identified to increase the risk of developing asthma such as exposure to air pollution and tobaccos smoke as well as occupational risk factors. In addition atopy, stress, and obesity all can increases the risk for asthma in genetically susceptible persons. CONCLUSION: Asthma represents a dysfunctional interaction with our genes and the environment to which they are exposed, especially in fetal and early infant life. The increasing prevalence of asthma in all age groups indicate that our living environment and immunity are in imbalance with each other reacting with airway inflammation to the environmental exposures and often non\u2010harmful proteins, such as allergens causing the current \u201Casthma and allergy epidemic.\u201D Because of the close relationship between asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis, it is important that otolaryngologists have a good understanding of asthma, the etiologic factors associated with disease, and its evaluation and management.","publish_time":"2015-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toskala, Elina; Kennedy, David W.","journal":"Int Forum Allergy Rhinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cb12a5090e0c523c3dfb927b2aa9caa65b0aea7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159773.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26335830/; https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.21557","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma genes","Bronchial asthma","risk of developing asthma","nonatopic asthma risk factors","increasing prevalence of asthma","genetic underpinning of asthma","environmental risk factors","good understanding of asthma","occupational risk factors","etiologic factors","environmental exposures","current prevalence","strong environmental influence","genetic studies","complex genetic disorder","quality of life","chronic rhinosinusitis","living environment","common chronic diseases","early infant life","tobaccos smoke","air pollution","age groups","society","imbalance","terms of morbidity","non\u2010harmful proteins","otolaryngologists","childhood","allergens","adults","dysfunctional interaction","literature","airway inflammation","obesity","close relationship","addition atopy","stress","growing burden","healthcare costs","immunity","children","CONCLUSION","large\u2010scale efforts","allergy epidemic","susceptible persons","RESULTS","METHODS","review","evaluation","management","BACKGROUND","alarming rate"],"language":"en"},

Among the measures to mitigate the risk of diarrhea outbreaks, cow vaccination stands out as one of the most important. However, the immune pressure resulting from routine vaccination may be able to select specific G and P genotypes in RVA field strains. This study aimed to determine the frequency and intensity of neonatal diarrhea and the incidence of RVA and attempted to monitor the G and P genotypes present in the RVA strains circulating in a high milk yield cattle herd vaccinated with RVA G6P[5] strain. Fecal samples (n = 1220) from 122 Holstein heifer calves between 0\u201330 days old that were born from RVA-vaccinated cows were collected at 10 different time points, regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea. The presence of RVA in fecal samples was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) technique and confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). G and P amplicons from 10 RVA-positive fecal samples from calves of different ages and collections were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The proportion of the calves and fecal samples that were positive for RVA were 62.3% (76/122) and 8.1% (99/1220), respectively. Using sequence analysis, all 10 RVA field strains presented genotype G10P[11]. The protection of G6P[5] vaccination is clear, as this genotype was not detected in this study, and it is known that vaccination against RVA reduces the incidence of diarrhea independent of genotype involved. This result demonstrates the importance of epidemiological monitoring of RVA genotypes circulating in vaccinated dairy cattle herds to the early detection of new potential pathogenic RVA strains.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fritzen, Juliana T.T.; Oliveira, Marcos V.; Lorenzetti, Elis; Miyabe, Fl\u00E1via M.; Viziack, Mariana P.; Rodrigues, Carlos A.; Ayres, Henderson; Alfieri, Alice F.; Alfieri, Amauri A.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41ee771b9bd14efb72c392edf03b3cff55c9d570.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827398/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518313750; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.02.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518313750","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVA","G and P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of RVA","RVA G6P","presence of RVA","RVA field strains","RVA-positive fecal samples","RVA-vaccinated cows","importance of epidemiological monitoring of RVA genotypes","early detection of new potential pathogenic RVA strains","dairy calves","P genotypes","absence of diarrhea","incidence of diarrhea independent of genotype","intensity of neonatal diarrhea","routine vaccination","cow vaccination","calves of different ages","risk of diarrhea outbreaks","vaccinated dairy cattle herds","P amplicons","Holstein heifer calves","specific G","genotype G10P","study","protection of G6P","different time points","important health issues","high milk yield cattle herd","technique","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","PAGE","RT-PCR","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","collections","frequency","rotavirus","days old","sequence analysis","result","immune pressure","proportion","nucleotide sequencing","measures","primary causes"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly designed real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay), that is established with an all-in-one reagent mix and no separate extraction required. RESULTS: The lower limit of detection (LOD) for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9\u20133.8) log10 cp/mL and 0.40 (CI: 0.2\u20131.5) TCID50/mL for S gene while 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9\u20133.7) log10 cp/mL and 0.4 (CI: 0.2\u20131.3) TCID50/mL for ORF1ab. The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log10 cp/mL. Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay. Clinical performances of Simplexa\u2122 COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman\u0027s method. Concordance analysis showed an \u0022almost perfect\u0022 agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being \u03BA = 0.938; SE = 0.021; 95% CI = 0.896-0.980.

DPP-4 is a ubiquitous protein with exopeptidase activity that exists in cell membrane-bound and soluble forms. The kidneys contain the highest levels of DPP-4, which is increased in diabetic nephropathy. DPP-4 inhibitors are a chemically heterogeneous class of drugs with important pharmacological differences. Of the globally marketed DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin is of particular interest for diabetic nephropathy as it is the only compound that is not predominantly excreted in the urine. Linagliptin is also the most potent DPP-4 inhibitor, has the highest affinity for this protein, and has the largest volume of distribution; these properties allow linagliptin to penetrate kidney tissue and tightly bind resident DPP-4. In animal models of kidney disease, linagliptin elicited multiple renoprotective effects, including reducing albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, independent of changes in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose levels. At the molecular level, linagliptin prevented the pro-fibrotic endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition by disrupting the interaction between membrane-bound DPP-4 and integrin \u03B21 that enhances signaling by transforming growth factor-\u03B21 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1. Linagliptin also increased stromal cell derived factor-1 levels, ameliorated endothelial dysfunction, and displayed unique antioxidant effects. Although the nephroprotective effects of linagliptin are yet to be translated to the clinical setting, the ongoing Cardiovascular and Renal Microvascular Outcome Study with Linagliptin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (CARMELINA\u00AE) study will definitively assess the renal effects of this DPP-4 inhibitor. CARMELINA\u00AE is the only clinical trial of a DPP-4 inhibitor powered to evaluate kidney outcomes.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanasaki, Keizo","journal":"Clin Sci (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6a325260dac29bfe718f1e57160583cb23b5908.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5828949.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29491123/; https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20180031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Linagliptin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resident DPP","marketed DPP","potent DPP","nephroprotective effects of linagliptin","highest levels of DPP","membrane-bound DPP","renal effects","inhibitors","growth factor-\u03B21","multiple renoprotective effects","unique antioxidant effects","vascular endothelial growth factor receptor","endothelial dysfunction","type","cell membrane","kidney tissue","kidney outcomes","glucose levels","CARMELINA","diabetic nephropathy","Renal Microvascular Outcome Study","stromal cell derived factor","reduced renal risk","Diabetes Mellitus","animal models of kidney disease","integrin \u03B21","ubiquitous protein","clinical setting","clinical trial","highest affinity","Patients","albuminuria","properties","tubulointerstitial fibrosis","heterogeneous class of drugs","independent of changes","mesenchymal transition","glomerulosclerosis","exopeptidase activity","interaction","important pharmacological differences","glucagon","largest volume of distribution","glycemic control","dipeptidyl peptidase","molecular level","peptide","Emerging evidence","GLP","soluble forms","kidneys","compound","urine"],"language":"en"},

Acute respiratory infections are now the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide, especially in developing countries. Recently, human rhinovirus (HRV) infection has been emerged as an important cause of pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of several viral agents principally, respiratory syncytial virus, and HRV in children with ARIs and their relationship with asthma exacerbation and pneumonia. METHODS: Between October 2011 and March 2014, 432 nasopharyngeal samples of children \u003C15 years of age with ARI hospitalized at a referral hospital for respiratory diseases were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses using a multiplex RT-qPCR. Clinical, epidemiological, and demographic data were collected and associated with symptomatology and viral infections. RESULTS: Viral infections were detected in at least 59\u00B77% of the enrolled patients, with HRV (26\u00B76%) being the most frequently detected. HRV infections were associated with clinical features of asthma and difficulty in breathing such as wheezing (P = 0\u00B70003), supraesternal (P = 0\u00B7046), and xiphoid retraction (P = 0\u00B7030). HRV subtype C (HRV-C) infections were associated with asthma (P = 0\u00B702). CONCLUSIONS: Human rhinovirus was the virus most commonly detected in pediatric patients with ARI. There is also an association of HRV-C infection with asthma exacerbation, emphasizing the relevance of this virus in severe pediatric respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2015-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno-Valencia, Yazmin; Hernandez-Hernandez, Victor A; Romero-Espinoza, Jose A I; Coronel-Tellez, Rodrigo H; Castillejos-Lopez, Manuel; Hernandez, Andres; Perez-Padilla, Rogelio; Alejandre-Garcia, Alejandro; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela; Ormsby, Christopher E; Vazquez-Perez, Joel A","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/425be277181521bab21a8e64d54657dfdcac6bde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4605408.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26289993/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARIs","ARI"],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV infections","Viral infections","HRV-C","acute respiratory infections","respiratory diseases","asthma exacerbation","association of HRV","HRV subtype C","respiratory syncytial virus","presence of respiratory viruses","clinical features of asthma","C infection","severe pediatric respiratory disease","viral agents","ARIs","pediatric patients","human rhinovirus","important cause of pneumonia","nasopharyngeal samples of children","significant role","enrolled patients","leading cause of mortality","exacerbations of chronic diseases","relevance","relationship","years of age","referral hospital","multiplex RT-qPCR","difficulty","breathing","demographic data","CONCLUSIONS","symptomatology","BACKGROUND","xiphoid retraction","developing countries","supraesternal","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively. The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice. In contrast, during SARS-CoV-\u2206E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively. Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-\u2206E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence. These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the E protein. To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the incorporation of novel chimeric proteins in the virus genome. In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations into the nsp1 protein. Deletions in the carboxy-terminal region of nsp1 protein led to higher host interferon responses and virus attenuation. Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and in vivo. Further, these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2015-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jimenez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; DeDiego, Marta L.; Casta\u00F1o-Rodriguez, Carlos; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Perlman, Stanley; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87c6c45d9946889a9a3551b31adff4c32c6c237e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4626112.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26513244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length E protein","E passage","SARS-CoV","full-length E gene","transmembrane protein","virus fitness","virus attenuation","virus genome","endogenous PBM","lethal parental virus","mutant virus regained fitness","carboxy-terminal region of nsp1 protein","membrane gene","vaccine biosafety","protected mice","effective vaccine","additional attenuating mutations","nsp1 genes","small attenuating deletions","cell culture","incorporation of novel chimeric proteins","stable vaccine candidates","revertant viruses","Recombinant viruses","mutated variant","new sequence","PDZ-binding motif","serial passages","higher host interferon responses","challenge","protection","insertion","removal","partial duplication","genetic stability","reversion","virulent phenotype","contrast","virulence","data"],"language":"en"},

We describe here an unusual translational frameshift event occurring between the GAG3 and POL3 genes of the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast. A \u002B1 frameshift occurs within the sequence GCG AGU U (shown as codons of GAG3), encoding alanine-valine ( GCG A GUU ). Unlike other programed translational frameshifts described, this event does not require tRNA slippage between cognate or near-cognate codons in the mRNA.

The low availability of the tRNA specific for the \u201Chungry\u201D serine codon, AGU, induces a translational pause required for frameshifting.

Thus, far, fly ash has received much attention but less attention has been paid to bottom ash. In this study, bottom ash samples were collected from a typical MW incinerator, and typical pollutants including heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ash were examined. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that CaO, SiO2 and Al2O3 were the main components of the bottom ash. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy showed that the ash contained large amounts of heavy metals, including Zn, Ti, Ba, Cu, Pb, Mn, Cr, Ni and Sn. Most of the heavy metals (e.g., Ba, Cr, Ni, and Sn) presented in the residual fraction; whereas Mn, Pb and Zn presented in Fe\u2013Mn oxides fraction, and Cu in organic-matter fraction. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tests indicated that the leached amounts of heavy metals were well below the limits. The sum of 16 US EPA priority PAHs (\u03A3PAHs) varied from 10.30 to 38.14mgkg\u22121, and the total amounts of carcinogenic PAHs ranged between 4.09 and 16.95mgkg\u22121, exceeding the limits regulated by several countries.

Sixty-eight percent of the strains were of capsular type A, 14% were type F, 5% were type D, 4% were type B and 9% were untypable. Nineteen distinct OMP profiles (OMP-types) were identified based mainly on molecular mass heterogeneity of the heat-modifiable (OmpA) and porin (OmpH) proteins. Fifty-six percent of the isolates were represented by 15 OMP-types, whereas 44% of the isolates were associated with four OMP-types. The extensive molecular mass heterogeneity of the OmpA and OmpH proteins supports previous findings that avian P. multocida strains are very diverse. Furthermore, the isolates studied were associated with different clinical symptoms and were recovered from a wide range of lesions and tissues. The high degree of strain diversity together with the wide variety of clinical symptoms suggest that certain avian strains of P. multocida are opportunistic pathogens of relatively low virulence. Strains of capsular types B, D and F, as well as the untypable isolates, were associated exclusively with specific OMP-types and represent distinct and widely disseminated clonal groups. These observations support the view that avian strains of P. multocida have a clonal population structure. Based on previous studies, the molecular mass heterogeneity of the OmpA and OmpH proteins might provide a selective advantage to P. multocida by generating antigenic variation.","publish_time":"2003-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, Robert L; MacCorquodale, Roslyn; Caffrey, Bridget","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5209b22f39590447aea8e07579381fe7557c5478.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117370.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113502003000; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113502003000","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMP"],"locations":["England","Wales"],"keyphrases":["multocida strains","specific OMP-types","avian Pasteurella multocida isolates","Strains of capsular types B","untypable isolates","certain avian strains of","distinct OMP profiles","OmpA","OmpH proteins","extensive molecular mass heterogeneity","capsular PCR","percent","wide variety of clinical symptoms","different clinical symptoms","previous findings","previous studies","clonal groups","wide range of lesions","clonal population structure","cases of fowl cholera","related infections","analysis of outer membrane protein","opportunistic pathogens","Wales","England","heat-modifiable","selective advantage","high degree of strain diversity","year period","porin","view","low virulence","tissues","observations","antigenic variation"],"language":"en"},

As hospital resources and staff become more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critically important to define which BC patients require more urgent care and which patients can wait for treatment until the pandemic is over. In this Special Communication, we use expert opinion of representatives from multiple cancer care organizations to categorize BC patients into priority levels (A, B, C) for urgency of care across all specialties. Additionally, we provide treatment recommendations for each of these patient scenarios. Priority A patients have conditions that are immediately life threatening or symptomatic requiring urgent treatment. Priority B patients have conditions that do not require immediate treatment but should start treatment before the pandemic is over. Priority C patients have conditions that can be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. The implementation of these recommendations for patient triage, which are based on the highest level available evidence, must be adapted to current availability of hospital resources and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region of the country. Additionally, the risk of disease progression and worse outcomes for patients need to be weighed against the risk of patient and staff exposure to SARS CoV-2 (virus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic). Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dietz, Jill R.; Moran, Meena S.; Isakoff, Steven J.; Kurtzman, Scott H.; Willey, Shawna C.; Burstein, Harold J.; Bleicher, Richard J.; Lyons, Janice A.; Sarantou, Terry; Baron, Paul L.; Stevens, Randy E.; Boolbol, Susan K.; Anderson, Benjamin O.; Shulman, Lawrence N.; Gradishar, William J.; Monticciolo, Debra L.; Plecha, Donna M.; Nelson, Heidi; Yao, Katharine A.","journal":"Breast Cancer Res Treat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc48747de995ae3f26cf7bc709b52a2b1704d100.json; document_parses/pdf_json/79adb7752402142af61785113d3d4b5a1235a0c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7181102.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333293/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-020-05644-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic","BC patients","Priority B patients","Priority C patients","treatment recommendations","COVID","immediate treatment","urgent care","conditions","urgency of care","risk of patient","priority levels","symptomatic requiring urgent treatment","multiple cancer care organizations","patient triage","patient scenarios","current availability of hospital resources","breast cancer","staff exposure","risk of disease progression","expert opinion of representatives","severity","life","unique set of challenges","SARS CoV","worse outcomes","clinicians","local context","highest level available evidence","Special Communication","virus","implementation","region","specialties","country","Physicians"],"language":"en"},

However, the natural prevalence of antibodies against these viruses in serum among population is unknown. METHODS: To measure antibodies to the spike (S) protein of the four common non-SARS HCoVs, recombinant S proteins of the four HCoVs were expressed and characterised in 293 T cell. An S-protein-based indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was then developed to detect anti-S IgG and IgM for the four individual HCoVs and applied to serum samples from a general asymptomatic population (218 children and 576 adults) in Beijing. RESULTS: Of 794 blood samples tested, only 29 (3.65%) were negative for anti-S IgG. The seropositivity of the four anti-S IgG antibodies was \u003E70% within the general population. The majority of seroconversions to four-HCoV positivity first occurred in children. Both S-IgG and S-IgM antibodies were detectable among children and increased with age, reaching a plateau at 6 years of age. However, no anti-S IgM was detected in healthy adults. CONCLUSION: Large proportions of children and adults in Beijing have evidence of anti-S IgG against four the HCoVs, and first infections by all four non-SARS HCoVs takes place during childhood.","publish_time":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Weimin; Wang, Wen; Wang, Huijuan; Lu, Roujian; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/287efc07973e7b2d046c7664771dc2e2a00b501b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3848659.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24040960/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-433","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["S-IgG","S-protein","anti-S IgM","anti-S IgG antibodies","S-IgM antibodies","evidence of anti-S IgG","recombinant S proteins","common non-SARS HCoVs","individual HCoVs","serum samples","healthy adults","general population","Large proportions of children","respiratory tract samples","Beijing","blood samples","natural prevalence of antibodies","general asymptomatic population","Non-severe acute respiratory syndrome","HCoV positivity","years of age","related human coronaviruses","BACKGROUND","indirect immunofluorescence assay","place","childhood","infections","NL63","IFA","HKU1","plateau","CONCLUSION","spike","seropositivity","majority of seroconversions","OC43","RESULTS","T cell","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Respiratory samples (nasal/throat swabs) were collected between August 2010 and November 2012 and real time PCR was used to detect different viral pathogens. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 32.1% (43/134) of samples from 101 patients. Specifically, 9% (12/134) were positive for HBoV, 8.2% (11/134) were positive for HAdV, 5.2% (7/134) were positive for HRV, and 1.5% (2/134) were positive for FLUBV or HMPV, as single infections. HRSV-A, HPIV-3, and HCoV-HKU1 were detected in one (0.75%) sample each. Co-infections were detected in 4.8% (6/134) of the samples. Peaks of viral infections were observed in March, April, May, August, and October. However, positive samples were detected all year round. Only 23.3% (10/43) of the positive samples were collected from patients with febrile illness. CONCLUSION: Results presented in this report suggest that respiratory viral infections are largely under diagnosed in immunocompetent adults. Although the majority of young adult infections are not life-threatening they may impose a significant burden, especially in developing countries since these individuals represent a large fraction of the working force.","publish_time":"2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Silva, Raquel Cirlene; da Silva Mendes, Gabriella; Rojas, Miguel Angel; Amorim, Ariane Ribeiro; Couceiro, Jos\u00E9 Nelson; Lupi, Omar; Elabras, Jos\u00E9; Pires, Gisele; Valle, Solange; Santos, Norma","journal":"Braz J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22ec513edb3fc9e2ccb251e98f22ac8dc96632ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185460.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867014001780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25307684/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2014.08.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867014001780","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rio de Janeiro"],"keyphrases":["positive samples","respiratory viral infections","Respiratory samples","Peaks of viral infections","single infections","Co-infections","upper respiratory tract infections","different viral pathogens","frequency of viral pathogens","majority of young adult infections","patients","RESULTS","symptomatic adults","immunocompetent adults","nasal","report","large fraction","developing countries","city of Rio","individuals","significant burden","throat swabs","FLUBV","HMPV","working force","real time PCR","METHODS","febrile illness","HPIV","Janeiro","CONCLUSION","year","HCoV-HKU1","HRSV","Viruses","HBoV","HAdV","HRV"],"language":"en"},

Deaths have occurred in otherwise healthy young individuals, which is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. The main presenting features were fever, pneumonitis, lymphopenia, and diarrhea. Notably, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and coryza were absent. The H5N1 strains are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, which can be used for treatment and prophylaxis. The widespread epidemic of avian influenza in domestic birds increases the likelihood for mutational events and genetic reassortment. The threat of a future pandemic from avian influenza is real. Adequate surveillance, development of vaccines, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic influenza planning are important.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5\u201392.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8\u201374.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9\u201380.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0\u201330.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7\u201351.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1\u20139.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2\u201321.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of \u003E13%.

One facet of this is frameshifting that often results in synthesis of a C-terminal region encoded by a new frame. Ribosomal frameshifting is utilized for the synthesis of additional products, for regulatory purposes and for translational \u2018correction\u2019 of problem or \u2018savior\u2019 indels. Utilization for synthesis of additional products occurs prominently in the decoding of mobile chromosomal element and viral genomes. One class of regulatory frameshifting of stable chromosomal genes governs cellular polyamine levels from yeasts to humans. In many cases of productively utilized frameshifting, the proportion of ribosomes that frameshift at a shift-prone site is enhanced by specific nascent peptide or mRNA context features. Such mRNA signals, which can be 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 of the shift site or both, can act by pairing with ribosomal RNA or as stem loops or pseudoknots even with one component being 4 kb 3\u2032 from the shift site. Transcriptional realignment at slippage-prone sequences also generates productively utilized products encoded trans-frame with respect to the genomic sequence.

It was also shown that DC-SIGN is a cell-surface adhesion factor that enhances viral entry of several virus families. Among those, Junin virus (JUNV) entry is enhanced in cells expressing DC-SIGN and for that reason surface-layer protein (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4365 was evaluated as a possible JUNV inhibitor. Experiments using 3T3 cells stably expressing DC-SIGN, showed an almost complete inhibition of JUNV infection when they were treated with S-layer in a similar extend as the inhibition shown by mannan. However no inhibition effect was observed in 3T3 wild type cells or in 3T3 cells expressing liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN or DC-SIGNR or CD209L). Treatments with S-layer during different times in the infection demonstrated that inhibition was only observed when S-layer was presented in early stages of the viral infection. This inhibition does not involve the classic recognition of mannose by this C-type lectin as the S-layer showed no evidence to be glycosylated. In fact, the highly basic nature of the S-layer (pI\u003E9.5) seems to be involved in electrostatic interactions between DC-SIGN and S-layer, since high pH abolished the inhibitory effect on infection cause by the S-layer. In silico analysis predicts a Ca2\u002B-dependant carbohydrate recognition domain in the SlpA protein. This novel characteristic of the S-layer, a GRAS status protein, contribute to the pathogen exclusion reported for this probiotic strain and may be applied as an antiviral agent to inhibit several kinds of viruses.","publish_time":"2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez, Mar\u00EDa Guadalupe; Prado Acosta, Mariano; Candurra, N\u00E9lida A.; Ruzal, Sandra M.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6364d1809513df9abcb1528d02742b580470e21e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124250.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X12008959; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22595457/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X12008959","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JUNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-layer binds","reason surface-layer protein","DC-SIGNR","3T3 cells","inhibition effect","complete inhibition of JUNV infection","C-type lectin DC-specific ICAM","viral infection","3T3 wild type cells","infection cause","viral entry","SlpA protein","grabbing nonintegrin","GRAS status protein","possible JUNV inhibitor","lymph node-specific ICAM","inhibitory effect","virus families","Junin virus","classic recognition of mannose","dependant carbohydrate recognition domain","cell-surface adhesion factor","liver","Ca2","high pH","different times","pathogen exclusion","early stages","Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC","basic nature","electrostatic interactions","probiotic strain","CD209L","novel characteristic","Treatments","Experiments","antiviral agent","kinds of viruses","silico analysis","evidence","pI","mannan"],"language":"en"},

Use of those methods has helped the U.S. swine industry to quantify the cyclical patterns of PRRS, to describe the impact that emerging pathogens has had on that pattern, to identify the nature and extent at which environmental factors (e.g., precipitation or land cover) influence PRRS risk, to identify PRRS virus emerging strains, and to assess the influence that voluntary reporting has on disease control. Results from the numerous studies reviewed here provide important insights into PRRS epidemiology that help to create the foundations for a near real-time prediction of disease risk, and, ultimately, will contribute to support the prevention and control of, arguably, one of the most devastating diseases affecting the North American swine industry. The review also demonstrates how different approaches to analyze and visualize the data may help to add value to the routine collection of surveillance data and support infectious animal disease control.","publish_time":"2017-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vilalta, Carles; Arruda, Andreia G.; Tousignant, Steven J.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of rhinovirus infections in relation to the atopic status of children treated for wheezing in Costa Rica, a country with an increased asthma burden. METHODS: The children enrolled (n=287) were 7 through 12 years old. They included 96 with acute wheezing, 65 with stable asthma, and 126 non-asthmatic controls. PCR methods, including gene sequencing to identify rhinovirus strains, were used to identify viral pathogens in nasal washes. Results were examined in relation to wheezing, total IgE, allergen-specific IgE antibody, and levels of expired nitric oxide (FE(NO)). RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of wheezing children compared to 13% of children with stable asthma and 17% of the non-asthmatic controls tested positive for rhinovirus (p\u003C0.001 for both comparisons). Among wheezing subjects, 75% of the rhinoviruses detected were Group C strains.

Virulent strains of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) cause severe disease in pigs characterized by immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which causes significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. METHODS: To reveal proteomic changes in swine serum during the acute stage of lethal CSFV infection, 5 of 10 pigs were inoculated with the virulent CSFV Shimen strain, the remainder serving as uninfected controls. A serum sample was taken at 3 days post-infection from each swine, at a stage when there were no clinical symptoms other than increased rectal temperatures (\u226540\u00B0C). The samples were treated to remove serum albumin and immunoglobulin (IgG), and then subjected to two-dimension differential gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Quantitative intensity analysis revealed 17 protein spots showing at least 1.5-fold quantitative alteration in expression. Ten spots were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF MS or LTQ MS. Expression of 4 proteins was increased and 6 decreased in CSFV-infected pigs. Functions of these proteins included blood coagulation, anti-inflammatory activity and angiogenesis.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK\u2013CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1\u00B75, 2\u00B70, and 3\u00B70 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0\u00B7001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%). We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation. FINDINGS: We included 3 862 012 individuals (1 957 935 [50\u00B77%] women and 1 904 077 [49\u00B73%] men). We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13\u00B77% were older than 70 years and 6\u00B73% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4\u00B746% (95% CI 4\u00B741\u20134\u00B751). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1\u00B75, four with an RR of 2\u00B70, and seven with an RR of 3\u00B70. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1\u00B75, 36 749 with an RR of 2\u00B70, and 73 498 with an RR of 3\u00B70. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1\u00B75, 293 991 with an RR of 2\u00B70, and 587 982 with an RR of 3\u00B70. INTERPRETATION: We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

PURPOSE: The study compares SARS knowledge, perceptions, behaviors, and information between Finns and the Dutch during the SARS outbreak in 2003. METHOD: The participants of the study, who used a modified SARS Psychosocial Research Consortium survey, were drawn from Internet panels in Finland (n = 308) and the Netherlands (n = 373) in June 2003. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) to compare Finns with the Dutch for various levels of perceptions and behaviors. RESULTS: Adjusted for age, education, and income, Finns were more likely to be knowledgeable and worried about SARS as well as to have low perceived comparative SARS risk and poor personal efficacy beliefs about preventing SARS. Finns were also more likely than the Dutch to have high confidence in physicians on SARS issues but less likely to have received information from the Internet and have confidence in Internet information. CONCLUSIONS: The study shed light on how two European populations differed substantially regarding lay responses to SARS. Understanding these differences is needed in formulating and executing communication and outbreak management.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vartti, A.-M.; Oenema, A.; Schreck, M.; Uutela, A.; de Zwart, O.; Brug, J.; Aro, A.

The global circulation and occasional introductions of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in humans and in pigs, respectively, might provide opportunities for this virus to reassort with other influenza viruses. These possible reassortment events might alter virulence and/or transmissibility of the new reassortants. Investigations that can detect such possible reassortants should therefore be included as a part of pandemic influenza surveillance plans. METHODS: We established a real-time RT-PCR-based strategy for the detection of reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. Singleplex SYBR green-based RT-PCR assays specific for each gene segment of pandemic H1N1/2009 were developed. These assays were evaluated by influenza viruses with different genetic backgrounds. RESULTS: All human pandemic H1N1 (N=27) and all seasonal human (N=58) isolates were positive and negative, respectively, for all 8 segments. Of 48 swine influenza viruses isolated from our on-going surveillance program of influenza viruses in swine, 10 were positive in all reactions. All 8 viral segments of these 10 samples were confirmed to be of pandemic H1N1 origin, indicating that these were caused by zoonotic transmissions from human to pigs. The 38 swine viruses that are non-pandemic H1N1/2009 had 1 to 6 gene segments positive in the tests. Further characterization of these non-pandemic H1N1/2009 swine viruses indicated that these PCR positive genes are the precursor genes of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that these assays can detect re-introductions of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in pigs. These assays might be useful screening tools for identifying viral reassortants derived from pandemic H1N1/2009 or its precursors.","publish_time":"2010-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poon, LLM; Mak, PWY; Li, OTW; Chan, KH; Cheung, CL; Ma, ES; Yen, HL; Vijaykrishna, D; Guan, Y; Peiris, JSM","journal":"Clinical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d69d26d2b4b10e593b24cf3610f4deb1bc53670.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/56/8/1340.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2010.149179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20567024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Singleplex SYBR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human pandemic H1N1","non-pandemic H1N1","pandemic H1N1 origin","precursor genes of pandemic H1N1","occasional introductions of pandemic H1N1","gene segment of pandemic H1N1","re-introductions of pandemic H1N1","swine influenza viruses","swine viruses","pandemic influenza surveillance plans","on-going surveillance program of influenza viruses","PCR positive genes","viral reassortants","possible reassortants","gene segments positive","pigs","novel reassortants","new reassortants","viral segments","real-time RT-PCR","seasonal human","RESULTS","Singleplex SYBR green-based RT-PCR assays specific","possible reassortment events","based strategy","detection of reassortment","useful screening tools","global circulation","co-infected cells","virulence","isolates","different genetic backgrounds","humans","transmissibility","zoonotic transmissions","tests","samples","characterization","METHODS","Investigations","opportunities","precursors","CONCLUSIONS","reactions"],"language":"en"},

This is the first study in the medical literature reporting the acute physical and psychological symptoms of the general population during a haze crisis. We evaluated the factors that are associated with psychological stress of haze exposure. METHODS: This study was conducted between June 21 to June 26, 2013. Participants were recruited by an online recruitment post and snowball sampling techniques. Participants were required to complete an online survey which was composed of demographics questionnaire, physical symptom checklist, perceived dangerous Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) value and views on the N-95 mask and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: A total of 298 participants returned the completed study questionnaire. The respondents reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (S.D. = 2.6). The five most common physical symptoms include mouth or throat discomfort (68.8%), nose discomfort (64.1%), eye discomfort (60.7%), headache (50.3%) and breathing difficulty (40.3%). The total IES-R score was 18.47 (S.D. = 11.69) which indicated that the study population experienced mild psychological stress but not to the extent of acute stress reaction syndrome. The perceived dangerous PSI level and number of physical symptoms were significantly associated with the mean intrusion score, mean hyper-arousal score, total mean IES-R score and total IES-R score (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a haze crisis is associated with acute physical symptoms and mild psychological stress. The number of physical symptoms and the perceived dangerous PSI values are important factors associated with psychological stress.","publish_time":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Roger C; Zhang, Melvyn W; Ho, Cyrus S; Pan, Fang; Lu, Yanxia; Sharma, Vijay K","journal":"BMC Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/417a6772d67e3b958d27a80ed09cabfea228d432.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3995317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642046/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-244x-14-81","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSI"],"locations":["Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["psychological symptoms","acute physical symptoms","number of physical symptoms","common physical symptoms","total IES-R score","total mean IES-R score","mild psychological stress","psychological stress of haze exposure","mean number","mean intrusion score","physical symptom checklist","widespread haze","haze crisis","study population","Participants","perceived dangerous PSI values","perceived dangerous PSI level","hyper-arousal score","completed study questionnaire","extent of acute stress reaction syndrome","throat discomfort","nose discomfort","eye discomfort","dangerous Pollutant Standard Index","important factors","general population","demographics questionnaire","online survey","online recruitment post","widespread forest fires","mask","snowball sampling techniques","views","mouth","Impact of Event Scale","medical literature","Indonesia","BACKGROUND","findings","neighbouring countries","RESULTS","respondents","CONCLUSIONS","headache","METHODS","difficulty"],"language":"en"},

For this aim, we analyzed the variations of the cis-acting elements in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) between the PEDV TW, CV777, and other reference strains. We also determined the previously unidentified transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), a sequence motif required for coronavirus transcription, and found that a nucleotide deletion in the TW strain, in comparison with CV777 strain, immediately downstream of the leader core sequence alters the identity between the leader TRS and the body TRS. Functional analyses using coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA revealed that such variations in cis-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression.

High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to explore differences. The results revealed that microbial dysbiosis by PEDV infection occurred in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets at each microbial taxonomic level.

The parental clone 3D4 exhibited a relatively rapid doubling time (25.5 h), high plating efficiency and mixed phenotype with respect to growth on a solid support. Single cell cloning of the 3D4 parent resulted in establishment of several cell lines; three of them designated 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 were selected for further characterization. All three clones supported the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), swine poxvirus, African swine fever virus (ASFV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), parainfluenza virus, bovine adenovirus (BAV), vaccinia virus (VV), and porcine adenovirus (PAV). Under the conditions tested the cells did not support replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The swine myeloid character was confirmed for all three clones by fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis using monoclonal antibodies 74-22-15 and DH59B, which recognize the pan-myeloid antigen cluster SWC3a. A subpopulation of each cell line was positive for nonspecific esterase activity and phagocytic activity to varying degrees depending on the media formulation. Cells from all three lines exhibited anchorage dependent growth when maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5\u201315% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and nonessential amino acids. Propagation in commercially formulated serum free media resulted in colony formation and growth in suspension. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to serum free media restored cell attachment. DMSO was also able to induce expression of CD14 monocyte marker in the 3D4/31 cell line maintained in FBS containing medium, as determined by FACS with monoclonal antibody CAM36A. Supplementation of RPMI medium with 10% porcine serum upregulated the expression of CD14 and induced expression of porcine macrophage markers recognized by antibodies 2B10 and 2G6 (Vet. Immunol.

Clinico-epidemiological information was used to analyze the relationship of hMPV co-infection to specific risk factors (demographics/symptoms/outcomes; status as health-care workers (HCWs)/patients; history of exposure/contact; ward location). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors. Results An hMPV outbreak occurred during 6\u201316 March 2003 (first week of the Hong Kong SARS epidemic). hMPV RNA was detected in 31 of 155 (20%) NPAs from SARS patients.

Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity (ExoN) that likely functions in RNA proofreading. In this study, we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of SARS-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged, and immunocompromised mouse models of human SARS. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo. Our approach represents a strategy with potential for broad applications for the stable attenuation of coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2012-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graham, Rachel L.; Becker, Michelle M.; Eckerle, Lance D.; Bolles, Meagan; Denison, Mark R.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Nat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16c593d2f8fd5ddd4fea3a61916a8438251c4fe7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a0d46c310512552aeb8e88f5a5d0c11f42fffcc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3518599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142821/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.2972","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","RNA proofreading","decreased fidelity","increased fidelity","stable mutator phenotype","Coronavirus replication fidelity","ExoN inactivation genotype","stable attenuation of coronaviruses","Live-attenuated RNA virus vaccines","CoV ExoN activity results","engineered inactivation of SARS","key determinant of virulence","exonuclease activity","attenuation of pathogenesis","immunocompromised mouse models of human SARS","escape","broad applications","antiviral therapy","likely functions","serial passage","potential","long-term persistent infection","strategy","reversion","approach","study"],"language":"en"},

We describe the clinical characteristics and factors associated with the death of patients who were hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza pneumonia in Shenyang, China, from November to December 2009. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective chart review of 68 patients who were hospitalized with pneumonia and confirmed to have 2009 H1N1 virus infection by a real time RT-PCR assay of respiratory specimens. RESULTS: Of the 68 patients we studied, 30 (44%) were admitted to an intensive care unit and 10 (14.7%) died. The median age of patients was 41 years (range, 18-66), and only one patient was over 65 years of age. The male to female ratio was 2.78:1 (50:18). Of the 68 patients, 23 (34%) had at least one underlying medical condition, 9 (13%) had a cigarette index \u2265400 and 22 (32%) were obese. All patients underwent chest radiography on admission and the findings were consistent with pneumonia in all cases. All patients were treated with oseltamivir and treatment was initiated at a median time of seven days after the onset of illness. The laboratory test results indicated lymphopenia, hypoproteinemia and elevated lactic dehydrogenase and C reactive protein levels. Of the 68 patients, 33 (52%) showed a reduction in CD4 T cell counts. Of the 58 patients who survived, 31 (53%) had lymphopenia and 27 recovered from this condition after five days. Of the 10 patients who died, nine (90%) had lymphopenia and only two patients recovered from this condition after five days. Obesity and recovery from lymphopenia after five days were factors associated with death, as determined by multivariate logistic-regression analysis (obesity, odds ratio = 23.06; lymphocytopenia reversion, odds ration = 28.69). CONCLUSIONS: During the evaluation period in Shenyang, China, 2009 H1N1 influenza caused severe illness requiring hospitalization in 68 patients, 10 (14.7%) of which died. Many of these patients were considered healthy adults and few were elderly (65 years or older). Obesity and lymphopenia, which was not restored after five days of treatment, were factors associated with poor outcomes of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Wei; Zhao, Hongwen; Lu, Xu; Wen, Ying; Zhou, Ying; Deng, Baocheng; Wang, Yu; Wang, Wen; Kang, Jian; Liu, Pei","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb7ee0f2bf9d062860b955af1f10b799529a2b69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2890005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20513239/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["death of patients","median age of patients","lymphopenia","H1N1 influenza pneumonia","H1N1 influenza infection","days of treatment","H1N1 virus infection","factors","Obesity","pandemic influenza","years of age","China","median time","Shenyang","underlying medical condition","severe illness","odds ration","female ratio","onset of illness","laboratory test results","real time RT-PCR assay of respiratory specimens","elevated lactic dehydrogenase","hypoproteinemia","C reactive protein levels","multivariate logistic-regression analysis","poor outcomes","findings","admission","lymphocytopenia reversion","hospitalization","reduction","CD4 T cell counts","evaluation period","chest radiography","retrospective chart review","spring","healthy adults","recovery","clinical characteristics","intensive care unit","CONCLUSIONS","cases","oseltamivir","range","cigarette index","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Identifying the precise parasite antigens that mediate immunity is essential for vaccine design, but has proved difficult. Completion of the Plasmodium falciparum genome revealed thousands of potential vaccine candidates, but a significant bottleneck remains in their validation and prioritization for further evaluation in clinical trials. Focusing initially on the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite proteome, we used peer-reviewed publications, multiple proteomic and bioinformatic approaches, to select and prioritize potential immune targets. We expressed 109 P. falciparum recombinant proteins, the majority of which were obtained using a mammalian expression system that has been shown to produce biologically functional extracellular proteins, and used them to create KILchip v1.0: a novel protein microarray to facilitate high-throughput multiplexed antibody detection from individual samples. The microarray assay was highly specific; antibodies against P. falciparum proteins were detected exclusively in sera from malaria-exposed but not malaria-na\u00EFve individuals. The intensity of antibody reactivity varied as expected from strong to weak across well-studied antigens such as AMA1 and RH5 (Kruskal\u2013Wallis H test for trend: p \u003C 0.0001). The inter-assay and intra-assay variability was minimal, with reproducible results obtained in re-assays using the same chip over a duration of 3 months. Antibodies quantified using the multiplexed format in KILchip v1.0 were highly correlated with those measured in the gold-standard monoplex ELISA [median (range) Spearman\u0027s R of 0.84 (0.65\u20130.95)]. KILchip v1.0 is a robust, scalable and adaptable protein microarray that has broad applicability to studies of naturally acquired immunity against malaria by providing a standardized tool for the detection of antibody correlates of protection. It will facilitate rapid high-throughput validation and prioritization of potential Plasmodium falciparum merozoite-stage antigens paving the way for urgently needed clinical trials for the next generation of malaria vaccines.","publish_time":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kamuyu, Gathoni; Tuju, James; Kimathi, Rinter; Mwai, Kennedy; Mburu, James; Kibinge, Nelson; Chong Kwan, Marisa; Hawkings, Sam; Yaa, Reuben; Chepsat, Emily; Njunge, James M.; Chege, Timothy; Guleid, Fatuma; Rosenkranz, Micha; Kariuki, Christopher K.; Frank, Roland; Kinyanjui, Samson M.; Murungi, Linda M.; Bejon, Philip; F\u00E4rnert, Anna; Tetteh, Kevin K.

Direct fluorescent antigen testing of the NP specimen for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, and parainfluenza virus was performed. If no virus was detected, NAT was performed for these 4 viruses, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. If a virus was detected by either method, NAT for the same virus was performed for the corresponding throat swab and saliva specimens. Results. A virus was detected in 105 of the 137 NP specimens. The same virus was detectable by NAT in 87 (83%) of 105 throat swab specimens and 77 (74%) of 104 saliva specimens. The likelihood of viral detection among throat swab and saliva swab specimens was higher when the NP specimen tested positive by direct fluorescent antigen testing, compared with NAT alone, and when the specimens were obtained within 3 days after symptom onset, compared with later in the illness. Conclusions. Throat swab and saliva specimens are inferior to NP specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses but might be acceptable for screening in a setting where it is impractical to obtain an NP specimen.","publish_time":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robinson, Joan L.; Lee, Bonita E.; Kothapalli, Sushma; Craig, William R.; Fox, Julie D.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3560169213ce99050b1a1be2ddbd98c517438471.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107872.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18444806/; https://doi.org/10.1086/529386","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["NAT"],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["saliva specimens","throat swab specimens","saliva swab specimens","direct fluorescent antigen-negative NP specimens","viral yield of direct fluorescent antigen detection of NP specimens","corresponding throat swab","parainfluenza virus","detection of respiratory viruses","viral yield of NAT","respiratory syncytial virus","Direct fluorescent antigen testing","likelihood of viral detection","B viruses","nucleic acid amplification tests","children","setting","adenovirus","human metapneumovirus","screening","study","days","adolescents","symptom onset","years","objective","Background","Methods","Results","illness","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

We show that the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 protein complex, whose prior known function is in autophagosome formation, is required for IFN\u03B3-mediated host defense against murine norovirus (MNV) infection. Importantly, the direct antiviral activity of IFN\u03B3 against MNV in macrophages required Atg5-Atg12, Atg7, and Atg16L1, but not induction of autophagy, the degradative activity of lysosomal proteases, fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, or the Atg8 processing protein Atg4B. IFN\u03B3, via Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1, inhibited formation of the membranous cytoplasmic MNV replication complex, where Atg16L1 localized. Thus, the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 complex performs a pivotal, nondegradative role in IFN\u03B3-mediated antiviral defense, establishing that multicellular organisms have evolved to use portions of the autophagy pathway machinery in a cassette-like fashion for host defense.","publish_time":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Seungmin; Maloney, Nicole S.; Bruinsma, Monique W.; Goel, Gautam; Duan, Erning; Zhang, Lei; Shrestha, Bimmi; Diamond, Michael S.; Dani, Adish; Sosnovtsev, Stanislav V.; Green, Kim Y.; Lopez-Otin, Carlos; Xavier, Ramnik J.; Thackray, Larissa B.; Virgin, Herbert W.","journal":"Cell Host \u0026 Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5949c889b68c4a8146b85dc28e6786289bb06c77.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2bac9f0274777b7647eb51522a6ed32d12647a7a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cf8b5272b3ef2cf76c0df25321472241e6f26de4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3348177.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2012.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312812000947; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312812000947/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22520467/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312812000947","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Atg16L1 complex","Atg5-Atg12","IFN\u03B3-mediated host defense","Atg16L1 protein complex","antiviral defense","direct antiviral activity of IFN\u03B3","induction of autophagy","degradative activity of macroautophagy","conserved autophagy proteins","autophagy pathway machinery","important defense mechanism","Host resistance","membranous cytoplasmic MNV replication complex","degradative activity of lysosomal proteases","inhibited formation","autophagosome formation","viral infection","Atg8 processing protein Atg4B","prior known function","murine norovirus","lysosomes","Type","cassette","nondegradative role","macrophages","fusion of autophagosomes","portions","coordinated action","multicellular organisms","fashion","Atg7","interferon","production"],"language":"en"},

Here, we review the roles of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of various enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria and protozoa, which infect the epithelial lining of the human and animal intestine. At host cell entry, enteric viruses, including norovirus, recognize mainly histo-blood group antigens. At the initial step of bacterial infections, carbohydrates also function as receptors for attachment. Here, we describe the function of carbohydrates in infection by Salmonella enterica and several bacterial species that produce a variety of fimbrial adhesions. During invasion by enteropathogenic protozoa, apicomplexan parasites utilize sialic acids or sulfated glycans. Carbohydrates serve as receptors for infection by these microbes; however, their usage of carbohydrates varies depending on the microbe. On the surface of the mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, various carbohydrate moieties are present and play a crucial role in infection, representing the site of infection or route of access for most microbes. During the infection and/or invasion process of the microbes, carbohydrates function as receptors for various microbes, but they can also function as a barrier to infection. One approach to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents is to modify the drug structure. Another approach is to modify the mode of inhibition of infection depending on the individual pathogen by using and mimicking the interactions with carbohydrates. In addition, similarities in mode of infection may also be utilized. Our findings will be useful in the development of new drugs for the treatment of enteric pathogens.","publish_time":"2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kato, Kentaro; Ishiwa, Akiko","journal":"Trop Med Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbe2e49fac5f007f3313b35f9b264bb4219aa67d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4361345.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2149/tmh.2014-25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25859152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mode of infection","function of carbohydrates","carbohydrates function","site of infection","infection strategies of various enteric pathogens","roles of carbohydrates","usage of carbohydrates","various microbes","enteric viruses","receptors","treatment of enteric pathogens","approach","various carbohydrate moieties","enteropathogenic protozoa","bacterial species","invasion process","mode of inhibition","initial step of bacterial infections","apicomplexan parasites","considerable public health concerns","sialic acids","gastrointestinal tract","therapeutic antimicrobial agents","development of new drugs","Salmonella enterica","norovirus","sulfated glycans","tropical regions","mucosal tissues","epithelial lining","host cell entry","human","crucial role","route of access","histo-blood group antigens","animal intestine","variety of fimbrial adhesions","individual pathogen","addition","similarities","drug structure","findings","surface","interactions","attachment","barrier"],"language":"en"},

Wild type JHM virus has the propensity to cause lytic infections in glial cultures, and a temperature-sensitive mutant designated JHM-ts43 invariably produces persistent infections with reduced cytopathic effects (CPE) as compared to the wild type. Moreover, a non-neurotropic isolate, designated JHM-Pi virus, produces either non-productive persistent infections at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) or productive persistent infections at high m.o.i., with, however, no CPE. The phenotypic expression of persistence is glial cell-dependent, since all three viruses produce similarly lytic infections when grown on various susceptible cell lines. The genetic basis of JHM virus persistence can be explained at the level of direct virus-glial cell interactions.","publish_time":"1988-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massa, Paul.T.; Wege, Helmut; ter Meulen, Volker","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41a75f80c918b30ee2e8e4f3d4dc08c5f0fdca29.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170288900287; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170288900287","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JHM virus isolates","Wild type JHM virus","designated JHM-Pi virus","lytic infections","non-productive persistent infections","genetic basis of JHM virus persistence","glial cell-dependent","level of direct virus-glial cell interactions","primary rat glial cultures","temperature-sensitive mutant designated JHM-ts43","JHM strain of murine hepatitis coronavirus","CPE","various susceptible cell lines","fatal acute encephalomyelitis","subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis","non-neurotropic isolate","phenotypic expression of persistence","rats","propensity","low multiplicity of infection","reduced cytopathic effects","correlation","growth properties","viruses","ability","disease"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of the S1 sequence showed that seven isolates were of the Massachusetts (Mass) genotype, five were SE17, and one was of the Connecticut (Conn) genotype, suggesting that these three IBVs were circulating in commercial poultry raised in different regions in the United States during the 1960s. The S1 genes of Mass-type isolates had high levels of sequence variation, representing 81.3-81.9 % nucleotide (nt) and 77.3-78.7 % amino acid (aa) identity when compared to those of the SE17-type isolates. In contrast, the N genes from the same isolates were less variable (\u003E92 % nt and \u003E93 % aa identity) when compared to those of the SE17-type isolates. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene indicated that one isolate (L748) was more closely related to the Mass type. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis based on the N gene showed that L748 was more closely related to the SE17 type, indicating that there had been exchange of S1 genetic materials between Mass- and SE17-like viruses. In addition, the Mass-type isolates had high levels of sequence identity in the S1 gene compared with widely used modified live vaccines (Mass41, Ma5 and H120) and modern field strains from the USA and other countries, suggesting a common ancestor.

RESULTS: Fifty-eight differentially expressed proteins were identified. Results demonstrated that some proteins which had functions in cytoskeleton organization, anti-oxidative stress, and stress response, showed different change patterns in abundance from chicken infected with the highly virulent ck/CH/LDL/97I P(5 )strain and those given the embryo-passaged, attenuated P(115 )stain. In addition, the dynamic transcriptional alterations of 12 selected proteins were analyzed by the real-time RT-PCR, and western blot analysis confirmed the change in abundance of heat shock proteins (HSP) beta-1, annexin A2, and annexin A5.

Abstract Conventional techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses are still being used, although molecular methods are now considered as a gold standard in this field. Molecular techniques have a great number of advantages such as an excellent sensitivity, specificity, adaptability to emerging viruses, capability for multiplex and for automation. With all the available repertoire of techniques for microbiological diagnosis, the knowledge relative to respiratory viruses is growing up not only for new aetiological agents but also for its epidemiology. The advances in molecular and non-molecular fast diagnostic methods for one or more respiratory viruses allow quick decisions in the management of the patient. However, there are also disadvantages. The great sensitivity of molecular techniques has meant a significant increase in the rate of multiple detections of respiratory viruses, whose clinical involvement is difficult to interpret. Finally, it remains to show whether the use of new techniques, of high cost, in the microbiological routine diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infections in the hospitalized patient, is cost effective.","publish_time":"2014-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pagarolas, Andr\u00E9s Ant\u00F3n; Su\u00F1\u00E9, Tom\u00E0s Pumarola","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73c50527c88e9c421764bf6ba94e491aab69dd3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X14701508; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X14701508","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["for the diagnosis of respiratory","of new","The great sensitivity of molecular","in the rate of multiple detections of respiratory","allow quick decisions in the management of the patient","t\u00E9cnicas moleculares","in the microbiological routine diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infections in the hospitalized patient","virus respiratorios","of high cost","the knowledge relative","show whether the","With all the available repertoire of","for microbiological diagnosis","have a great number of","in molecular and non","virus emergentes","nuevos virus","capability for multiplex and for automation","nuevas t\u00E9cnicas","t\u00E9cnicas tradicionales","although molecular methods","m\u00E9todos moleculares aplicados","molecular fast diagnostic methods for one or","diagn\u00F3stico microbiol\u00F3gico","diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido","infecci\u00F3n viral respiratoria","growing up not only for new aetiological agents but also for its epidemiology","now considered as a gold standard in","etiolog\u00EDa viral","infecci\u00F3n respiratoria aguda","m\u00FAltiples dianas","cost effective","capacidad de adaptaci\u00F3n","excelente sensibilidad","paciente hospitalizado","mayor sensibilidad","elevado coste","such as an excellent sensitivity","tasa de codetecciones m\u00FAltiples","still being used","meant a significant","specificity","adaptability","especificidad","emerging","whose clinical involvement","infecciones respiratorias agudas","principales ventajas","it remains","incremento significativo","Abstract Conventional","manejo","mismo ensayo","forma inmediata","rutina","toma de decisiones","implicaci\u00F3n cl\u00EDnica resulta dif\u00EDcil","difficult","interpret","Finally","pron\u00F3stico","field","posibilidad de automatizaci\u00F3n","aut\u00E9ntica revoluci\u00F3n","inconvenientes","papel","transmisi\u00F3n nosocomial","However","there","utilizaci\u00F3n","existencia","embargo"],"language":"es"},

Many agents have fulfilled the broad definition of emerging blood-transmitted infections, including West Nile virus (WNV), Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium spp., Babesia spp., parvovirus B19, dengue virus, and the prions that cause variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (vCJD). Other agents such as human herpes virus- 8 (HHV-8\u2014Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma virus) and Borellia (Lyme disease) and, perhaps, avian flu virus, are known to have a viremic phase, but have not yet been proved to be transfusion-transmitted. In the wake of these threats, transfusion services use a variety of donor screening interventions, including serologic assays, nucleic acid assays, and geographic exclusions based on potential exposure. The ultimate safeguard may be a pre-emptive pathogen inactivation strategy that will disrupt all nucleic acid\u2013containing agents (though not prions). Considerable effort and resources have been invested in this arena, but currently no single technique is effective for inactivation of both liquid and cellular blood products and toxicity issues have not been completely resolved. The blood supply is remarkably safe with the risk of major pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV now reduced to less than one transmission per 2 to 3 million exposures. However, to approach near-zero infectious disease risk for emerging and re-emerging pathogens, new strategies such as pathogen inactivation or multi-pathogen microarray technology will need to be developed or refined.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alter, Harvey J.; Stramer, Susan L.; Dodd, Roger Y.","journal":"Seminars in Hematology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71e02b3035946c8a59295f6adccae605300790b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118992.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037196306002381; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0037196306002381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue virus","blood supply","blood establishments","human herpes virus","transmitted human immunodeficiency virus","hepatitis C virus","West Nile virus","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma virus","avian flu virus","agents","cellular blood products","devastating effects of blood","broad definition of emerging blood-transmitted infections","pre-emptive pathogen inactivation strategy","nucleic acid assays","infectious disease risk","HIV","Lyme disease","prions","risk of major pathogens","re-emergence of new threats","serologic assays","re-emerging pathogens","multi-pathogen microarray technology","new strategies","variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease","transfusion services","variety of donor screening interventions","Babesia","WNV","geographic exclusions","liquid","HHV","Trypanosoma cruzi","Plasmodium","Borellia","safety","toxicity issues","parvovirus B19","single technique","vCJD","HCV","ultimate safeguard","resources","arena","potential exposure","wake","Considerable effort","viremic phase","transmission","exposures"],"language":"en"},

The dengue virus is a single-stranded RNA virus with four major serotypes. Infection with one serotype confers homotypic immunity but not heterologous immunity, and secondary infection with another serotype may lead to more severe disease. The major route of transmission occurs through the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector, but dengue has also been transmitted through blood transfusion and organ transplantation. Infection results in a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection, undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) to dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Dengue is spreading rapidly to new areas and with increasing frequency of major outbreaks. A trend has also been observed towards increasing age among infected patients. This will impact blood supply availability as more blood donors are deferred because of dengue infection or exposure to infection. The risk of transmission through transfusion of blood from asymptomatic viraemic donors will also increase. Although screening tests for dengue and effective pathogen reduction processes are now available for the blood supply, the value of implementing these costly measures needs to be carefully considered. Demand for platelets and fresh frozen plasma will rise with increasing number of DHF/DSS. Evidence-based guidelines for the clinical use of these blood components in the management of patients with DHF/DSS have not been well established, and inappropriate use will contribute to the challenges faced by blood services.","publish_time":"2009-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teo, D; Ng, L C; Lam, S","journal":"Transfus Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ef0cd02635a7841b2b26cb159038427c31c39b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2713854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19392949/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00916.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DHF/DSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue infection","dengue fever","dengue virus","blood donors","blood transfusion","transfusion of blood","asymptomatic infection","dengue haemorrhagic fever","blood components","blood services","Infection results","secondary infection","dengue shock syndrome","blood supply availability","DSS","increasing number of DHF","undifferentiated fever","clinical use","major route of transmission","increasing frequency of major outbreaks","major serotypes","asymptomatic viraemic donors","heterologous immunity","homotypic immunity","risk of transmission","management of patients","inappropriate use","infected patients","spectrum of clinical illness","single-stranded RNA virus","effective pathogen reduction processes","fresh frozen plasma","Aedes aegypti mosquito vector","screening tests","new areas","Demand","platelets","value","challenges","Evidence-based guidelines","endemic","organ transplantation","common arthropod","exposure","people","year","costly measures","severe disease","countries","trend"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we examined knowledge of SPs and IC among clinical students attending the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we targeted clinical students from the following five colleges: Medicine (fifth and sixth years); Dentistry (second semester of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years); Applied Medical Sciences (third and fourth years); Nursing (third and fourth years); and Pharmacy (third, fourth, and fifth years). The data collection instrument was an adopted 41-item questionnaire that measured knowledge of SPs and IC in five domains. A score of \u226524 (60%) indicated sufficient knowledge. RESULTS: The participants comprised 129 students (67 men). The proportions of participants from each college were: Medicine, 58.1% (n = 75); Dentistry, 14% (n = 18); Applied Medical Sciences, 13.2% (n = 17); Nursing, 10.9% (n = 14); and Pharmacy, 3.9% (n = 5).

Methods We report key epidemiological details of three major hospital outbreaks of SARS in mainland China, and estimate the evolution of the effective reproduction number in each of the three hospitals during the course of the outbreaks. Results The three successive hospital outbreaks infected 41, 99 and 91 people of whom 37%, 60% and 70% were hospital staff. These cases resulted in 33 deaths, five of which occurred in hospital staff. In a multivariate logistic regression, age and whether or not the case was a healthcare worker (HCW) were found to be significant predictors of mortality. The estimated effective reproduction numbers (95% CI) for the three epidemics peaked at 8 (5, 11), 9 (4, 14) and 12 (7, 17). In all three hospitals the epidemics were rapidly controlled, bringing the reproduction number below one within 25, 10 and 5 days respectively. Conclusions This work shows that in three major hospital epidemics in Beijing and Tianjin substantially higher rates of transmission were initially observed than those seen in the community. In all three cases the hospital epidemics were rapidly brought under control, with the time to successful control becoming shorter in each successive outbreak.","publish_time":"2009-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, Ben S.; Fang, Li\u2010Qun; Zhou, Jie\u2010Ping; Feng, Dan; Lv, Hui; Wei, Mao\u2010Ti; Wang, Shi\u2010Xin; Cao, Wu\u2010Chun; De Vlas, Sake J.","journal":"Trop Med Int Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86eeaa094d457fc14597e5c51a3f8fb4351d61ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169696.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02346.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19814763/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Beijing","Tianjin"],"keyphrases":["major hospital epidemics","hospital staff","successive hospital outbreaks","major hospital outbreaks of SARS","hospitals","mainland China","successful control","cases","estimated effective reproduction numbers","effectiveness of control measures","successive outbreak","Tianjin","Beijing","transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome","key epidemiological details","evolution","HCW","age","higher rates of transmission","time","CI","multivariate logistic regression","healthcare worker","Methods","significant predictors of mortality","Objective","course","people","deaths","days","Conclusions","community"],"language":"en"},

Although genome structure of SAV has been characterized and each individual viral protein has been identified, the role of 6K protein in viral replication and infectivity remains undefined. The 6K protein of alphaviruses is a small and hydrophobic protein which is involved in membrane permeabilization, protein processing and virus budding. Because these common features are shared across many viral species, they have been named viroporins. In the present study, we applied reverse genetics to generate SAV3 6K-deleted (\u03946K) variant and investigate the role of 6K protein. Our findings show that the 6K-deletion variant of salmonid alphavirus is non-viable. Despite viral proteins of \u03946K variant are detected in the cytoplasm by immunostaining, they are not found on the cell surface. Further, analysis of viral proteins produced in \u03946K cDNA clone transfected cells using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) and western blot showed a protein band of larger size than E2 of wild-type SAV3. When \u03946K cDNA was co-transfected with SAV3 helper cDNA encoding the whole structural genes including 6K, the infectivity was rescued. The development of CPE after co-transfection and resolved genome sequence of rescued virus confirmed full-length viral genome being generated through RNA recombination. The discovery of the important role of the 6K protein in virus production provides a new possibility for the development of antiviral intervention which is highly needed to control SAV infection in salmonids.","publish_time":"2014-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Tz-Chun; Johansson, Daniel X.; Haugland, \u00D8yvind; Liljestr\u00F6m, Peter; Evensen, \u00D8ystein","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4800f47ba4610ae4098de4cccc0a4b34c4ae51c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4091863.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAV"],"locations":["Atlantic","Western Europe"],"keyphrases":["individual viral protein","hydrophobic protein","protein processing","protein of alphaviruses","viral proteins of \u03946K variant","viral replication","viral species","full-length viral genome","analysis of viral proteins","protein band of larger size","SAV3 helper cDNA","genome structure of SAV","genome sequence of rescued virus","deletion variant of salmonid alphavirus","\u03946K cDNA clone transfected cells","virus production","type SAV3","salmonid aquaculture","SAV infection","important role","infectivity","co-transfection","emerging disease","western blot","Pancreas disease","development of CPE","Western Europe","development of antiviral intervention","radioimmunoprecipitation","RIPA","E2 of wild","new possibility","Atlantic salmon","membrane permeabilization","PD","reverse genetics","structural genes","RNA recombination","present study","cytoplasm","common features","salmonids","discovery","cell surface","viroporins","immunostaining","findings"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we synthesized eighty-one kinds of peptides derived from the spike (S)2 domain of type I FIPV KU-2 strain, the S2 domain of type II FIPV 79-1146 strain, and the nucleocapcid (N) protein of FIPV KU-2 strain. To detect the T helper (Th)1 epitope, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from FIPV-infected cats were cultured with each peptide, and Th1-type immune responses were measured using feline interferon (fIFN)-\u03B3 production as an index. To detect the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope, we investigated the reactivity of plasma collected from FIPV-infected cats against each peptide by ELISA. Four and 2 peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in the heptad repeat (HR)1 and inter-helical (IH) regions of the S2 domain of type I FIPV, respectively, and these were located on the N-terminal side of the regions. In the S2 domain of type II FIPV, 2, 3, and 2 peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in the HR1, IH, and HR2 regions, respectively, and these were mainly located on the C-terminal side of the regions. In the S2 domain of type I FIPV, 3 and 7 peptides containing linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were identified in the IH and HR2 regions, respectively. In the S2 domain of type II FIPV, 4 peptides containing linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were identified in the HR2 region. The Th1 epitopes in the S2 domain of type I and II FIPV were located in different regions, but the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were mostly located in the HR2 region. Eight peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in N protein, and 3 peptides derived from residues 81 to 100 and 137 to 164 showed strong inductivity of fIFN-\u03B3 production in PBMCs isolated from type I FIPV- and type II FIPV-infected non-FIP cats. In N protein, 4 peptides containing linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were identified, and 2 peptides derived from residues 345 to 372 showed strong reactivity with plasma of type I FIPV- and type II FIPV-infected cats. The Th1 and linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were located at different positions in both the S2 domain and N protein.

While this phenomenon is found in many different species, its function is obscure. Understanding the molecular profile characteristic of reactive astrocytes should help define their function. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of molecules whose levels of expression differentiate activated from resting astrocytes and to use the molecular profile of reactive astrocytes as the basis for speculations on the functions of these cells. At present, reactive astrocytosis is defined primarily as an increase in the number and size of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein. In vivo, this increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells reflects predominantly phenotypic changes of resident astroglia rather than migration or proliferation of such cells. Upon activation, astrocytes upmodulate the expression of a large number of molecules. From this molecular profile it becomes apparent that reactive astrocytes may benefit the injured nervous system by participating in diverse biological processes. For example, upregulation of proteases and protease inhibitors could help remodel the extracellular matrix, regulate the concentration of different proteins in the neuropil and clear up debris from degenerating cells. Cytokines are key mediators of immunity and inflammation and could play a critical role in the regulation of the blood-central nervous system interface. Neurotrophic factors, transporter molecules and enzymes involved in the metabolism of excitotoxic amino acids or in the antioxidant pathway may help protect neurons and other brain cells by controlling neurotoxin levels and contributing to homeostasis within the central nervous system. Therefore, an impairment of astroglial performance has the potential to exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. Based on the synopsis of studies presented, a number of issues become apparent that deserve a more extensive analysis. Among them are the relative contribution of microglia and astrocytes to early wound repair, the characterization of astroglial subpopulations, the specificity of the astroglial response in different diseases as well as the analysis of reactive astrocytes with techniques that can resolve fast physiologic processes. Differences between reactive astrocytes in vivo and primary astrocytes in culture are discussed and underline the need for the development and exploitation of models that will allow the analysis of reactive astrocytes in the intact organism.","publish_time":"1993-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eddleston, M.; Mucke, L.","journal":"Neuroscience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b03acadefb0d7a3a233f34c4837d4c15197ea5f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/030645229390380X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645229390380X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of reactive astrocytes","astrocytes upmodulate","primary astrocytes","resting astrocytes","molecular profile of reactive astrocytes","molecular profile characteristic of reactive astrocytes","vigorous activation of astrocytes","reactive astrocytosis","size of cells","degenerating cells","brain cells","injured nervous system","blood-central nervous system interface","glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells","large number of molecules","levels of expression","different species","different diseases","astroglial response","transporter molecules","summary of molecules","number of issues","increase","extensive analysis","characterization of astroglial subpopulations","concentration of different proteins","diverse biological processes","impairment of astroglial performance","neurotoxin levels","diverse neurologic injuries","fast physiologic processes","early wound repair","enzymes","neuropil","specificity","phenotypic changes of resident astroglia","techniques","inflammation","protease inhibitors","metabolism of excitotoxic amino acids","potential","migration","homeostasis","basis","speculations","antioxidant pathway","relative contribution of microglia","key mediators of immunity","upregulation of proteases","extracellular matrix","Neurotrophic factors","neurons","proliferation","debris","culture","critical role","intact organism","development","need","Cytokines","example","exploitation of models","functions","Differences","neuronal dysfunction","synopsis of studies","review","phenomenon","present","purpose"],"language":"en"},

A new contemporary strain of HPeV1, KVP6 (accession no. KC769584), was isolated from a clinical specimen. Full-genome alignment revealed that HPeV1 KVP6 shares high genome homology with the German strain of HPeV1, 7555312 (accession no. FM178558) and could be classified in the clade 1B group. An intertypic recombination was shown within the P2-P3 genome regions of HPeV1. Cell-type tropism test showed that T84 cells (colon carcinoma cells), A549 cells (lung carcinoma cells) and DBTRG-5MG cells (glioblastoma cells) were susceptible to HPeV1 infection, which might be relevant clinically. A facilitated cytopathic effect and increased viral titers were reached after serial viral passages in Vero cells, with viral genome mutation found in later passages. HPeV1 is sensitive to elevated temperature because 39\u00B0C incubation impaired virion production. HPeV1 induced innate immunity with phosphorylation of interferon (IFN) regulatory transcription factor 3 and production of type I IFN in A549 but not T84 cells. Furthermore, type I IFN inhibited HPeV1 production in A549 cells but not T84 cells; T84 cells may be less responsive to type I IFN stimulation. Moreover, HPeV1-infected cells showed downregulated type I IFN activation, which indicated a type I IFN evasion mechanism. The characterization of the complete genome and infection features of HPeV1 provide comprehensive information about this newly isolated HPeV1 for further diagnosis, prevention or treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2015-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Jenn-Tzong; Yang, Chih-Shiang; Chen, Yao-Shen; Chen, Bao-Chen; Chiang, An-Jen; Chang, Yu-Hsiang; Tsai, Wei-Lun; Lin, You-Sheng; Chao, David; Chang, Tsung-Hsien","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da26991502da97b746b148ad17cb2b435ef8e0cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4380134.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T84 cells","HPeV1-infected cells","A549 cells","Vero cells","glioblastoma cells","HPeV1 KVP6","HPeV1 infection","isolated HPeV1","IFN inhibited HPeV1 production","colon carcinoma cells","lung carcinoma cells","infection features of HPeV1","German strain of HPeV1","production of type","P2-P3 genome regions of HPeV1","new contemporary strain of HPeV1","IFN activation","IFN stimulation","downregulated type","viral genome mutation","complete genome","genome alignment","IFN evasion mechanism","high genome homology","Cell-type tropism test","serial viral passages","accession","increased viral titers","gastrointestinal disease","respiratory disease","later passages","severe human clinical conditions","Human parechoviruses","clinical specimen","C incubation impaired virion production","meningitis","phosphorylation of interferon","encephalitis","regulatory transcription factor","comprehensive information","elevated temperature","members","facilitated cytopathic effect","diagnosis","prevention","DBTRG","innate immunity","family Picornaviridae","HPeVs","neonatal sepsis","treatment strategies","characterization","KC769584","clade","B group","intertypic recombination","FM178558"],"language":"en"},

Several species of this family are also pathogenic to humans and are recognized as potential agents of biological warfare and terrorism. The objective of this work was the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of VEEV after a potential bioterrorism assault or an natural outbreak of VEEV. RESULTS: In this work, human anti-VEEV single chain Fragments variable (scFv) were isolated for the first time from a human na\u00EFve antibody gene library using optimized selection processes. In total eleven different scFvs were identified and their immunological specificity was assessed. The specific detection of the VEEV strains TC83, H12/93 and 230 by the selected antibody fragments was proved. Active as well as formalin inactivated virus particles were recognized by the selected antibody fragments which could be also used for Western blot analysis of VEEV proteins and immunohistochemistry of VEEV infected cells. The anti-VEEV scFv phage clones did not show any cross-reactivity with Alphavirus species of the Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) antigenic complex, nor did they react with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), if they were used as detection reagent. CONCLUSION: For the first time, this study describes the selection of antibodies against a human pathogenic virus from a human na\u00EFve scFv antibody gene library using complete, active virus particles as antigen. The broad and sensitive applicability of scFv-presenting phage for the immunological detection and diagnosis of Alphavirus species was demonstrated. The selected antibody fragments will improve the fast identification of VEEV in case of a biological warfare or terroristic attack or a natural outbreak.","publish_time":"2008-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirsch, Martina Inga; H\u00FClseweh, Birgit; Nacke, Christoph; R\u00FClker, Torsten; Schirrmann, Thomas; Marschall, Hans-J\u00FCrgen; Hust, Michael; D\u00FCbel, Stefan","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06cf324e3d0f793e5c722894c6ea6949655b1f10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2543005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18764933/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-8-66","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEEV","Eastern"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of VEEV","human pathogenic virus","natural outbreak of VEEV","Chikungunya virus","selected antibody fragments","Western equine encephalitis virus","fast identification of VEEV","VEEV strains TC83","active virus particles","anti-VEEV scFv phage clones","Eastern equine encephalitis virus","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","human na\u00EFve scFv antibody gene library","human anti-VEEV single chain Fragments variable","human na\u00EFve antibody gene library","immunohistochemistry of VEEV infected cells","immunological detection","Western blot analysis of VEEV proteins","formalin inactivated virus particles","specific detection","detection reagent","diagnosis of Alphavirus species","selection of antibodies","work","sensitive applicability of scFv","time","Alphavirus group","potential agents of biological warfare","immunological specificity","optimized selection processes","potential bioterrorism assault","generation of recombinant antibodies","WEEV","case","EEEV","terroristic attack","cross-reactivity","antigenic complex","humans","BACKGROUND","different scFvs","family","H12","study","objective","CHIKV","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Both natural and synthetic zeolites have been used in animal nutrition mainly to improve performance traits and, based on their fundamental physicochemical properties, they were also tested and found to be efficacious in the prevention of ammonia and heavy metal toxicities, poisonings as well as radioactive elements uptake and metabolic skeletal defects. During the last decade, their utilization as mycotoxin-binding adsorbents has been a topic of considerable interest and many published research data indicate their potential efficacy against different types of mycotoxins either as a primary material or after specific modifications related to their surface properties. Ingested zeolites are involved in many biochemical processes through ion exchange, adsorption and catalysis. Recent findings support their role in the prevention of certain metabolic diseases in dairy cows, as well as their shifting effect on nitrogen excretion from urine to faeces in monogastric animals, which results in lower aerial ammonia concentration in the confinement facilities. Moreover, new evidence provide insights into potential mechanisms involved in zeolites supporting effect on animals suffered from gastrointestinal disturbances, including intestinal parasite infections. All the proposed mechanisms of zeolites\u2019 effects are summarized in the present review and possible focus topics for further research in selected areas are suggested.","publish_time":"2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papaioannou, D.; Katsoulos, P.

For the purpose of evaluating the bioactivity of existing animal-used QdNOs drugs against representative pathogenic microorganism, the representative drugs of quinoxalines including cyadox, mequindox, quinocetone and their metabolites were submitted to the in vitro evaluation for antituberculosis, antimycoplasma, antifungal and antiviral activities. RESULTS: In antituberculosis assays, the prototype compounds were active (MIC = 4 ~ 8 \u03BCg/mL) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis. Combined antimicrobial susceptibility test indicated that cyadox, mequindox and quinocetone combined with rifampicin had additive effect against M. tuberculosis complex with Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FIC) of 0.75. Results of antifungal assays showed that quinocetone was active against Microsporum canis with MIC of 8 \u03BCg/mL. Antimycoplasma screening showed a generally good activity of quinocetone against Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, with MIC between 8 and 16 \u03BCg/mL. As shown from the combined antimicrobial susceptibility test, cyadox, mequindox and quinocetone combined with tetracycline had additive effect against Mycoplasma gallisepticum with FIC of 0.75. These compounds were also submitted to antiviral assay against infectious bursal disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus and classical swine fever virus. The results obtained showed that these QdNOs and their metabolites have no inhibitory activity against these viruses in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: QdNOs exhibit antimicrobial activities against mycobacteria, mycoplasma and fungi. This study gives new insight in further application of QdNOs and offers a way to promote the healthcare of animal husbandry.

Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and G-U-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, RNAinverse, RNA-SSD as well as INFO-RNA are limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm Inv which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures. RESULTS: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm Inv. We give a detailed analysis of Inv, including pseudocodes. We show that Inv allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot 3-noncrossing RNA structures-a class which is difficult to construct via dynamic programming routines. Inv is freely available at http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm Inv extends inverse folding capabilities to RNA pseudoknot structures. In comparison with RNAinverse it uses new ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result, Inv is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially exhibit cross-serial interactions.","publish_time":"2010-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, James ZM; Li, Linda YM; Reidys, Christian M","journal":"Algorithms Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3778f543ef74ff3a0dd90250221b77ee38d7533.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2909241.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573197/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-7188-5-27","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["noncrossing RNA structures","RNA pseudoknot structures","RNA secondary structures","RNA sequences","natural RNA structures","RNA-SSD","INFO-RNA","artificial RNA","noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot","spectrum of RNA functionalities","inverse folding algorithm Inv","canonical pseudoknot structures","context of competing structures","inverse folding capabilities","established inverse folding algorithms","detailed analysis of Inv","noncrossing Watson-Crick","specific structure","RNAinverse","paper","cross-serial interactions","additional cross-serial base pairs","base pairings","new ribozymes","new ideas","novel sequences","G-U","instance","class","variety of structural configurations","dynamic programming routines","induced neutral networks","comparison","pseudocodes","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","pseudoknots","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

With the goal of managing disease in free-ranging bats, we tested modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and raccoon poxvirus (RCN) as potential vaccine vectors in the Brazilian Free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), using biophotonic in vivo imaging and immunogenicity studies. Animals were administered recombinant poxviral vectors expressing the luciferase gene (MVA-luc, RCN-luc) through oronasal (ON) or intramuscular (IM) routes and subsequently monitored for bioluminescent signal indicative of viral infection. No clinical illness was noted after exposure to any of the vectors, and limited luciferase expression was observed. Higher and longer levels of expression were observed with the RCN-luc construct. When given IM, luciferase expression was limited to the site of injection, while ON exposure led to initial expression in the oral cavity, often followed by secondary replication at another location, likely the gastric mucosa or gastric associated lymphatic tissue. Viral DNA was detected in oral swabs up to 7 and 9 days post infection (dpi) for MVA and RCN, respectively. While no live virus was detected in oral swabs from MVA-infected bats, titers up to 3.88 \u00D7 10(4) PFU/ml were recovered from oral swabs of RCN-infected bats. Viral DNA was also detected in fecal samples from two bats inoculated IM with RCN, but no live virus was recovered. Finally, we examined the immunogenicity of a RCN based rabies vaccine (RCN-G) following ON administration. Significant rabies neutralizing antibody titers were detected in the serum of immunized bats using the rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT).

We imputed BovineHD genotypes to whole genome sequence for 2703 Holsteins that were cases or controls for Bovine Respiratory Disease and sampled from either California or New Mexico to construct and compare genomic prediction models. The sequence variation reference dataset comprised variants called for 1578 animals from Run 5 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project, including 450 Holsteins and 29 animals sequenced from this study population. Genotypes for 9,282,726 variants with minor allele frequencies \u22655% were imputed and used to obtain genomic predictions in GEMMA using a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model. RESULTS: Variation explained by markers increased from 13.6% using BovineHD data to 14.4% using imputed whole genome sequence data and the resolution of genomic regions detected as harbouring QTL substantially increased. Explained variation in the analysis of the combined California and New Mexico data was less than when data for each state were separately analysed and the estimated genetic correlation between risk of Bovine Respiratory Disease in California and New Mexico Holsteins was \u2212 0.36. Consequently, genomic predictions trained using the data from one state did not accurately predict disease risk in the other state. To determine if a prediction model could be developed with utility in both states, we selected variants within genomic regions harbouring: 1) genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens responsible for Bovine Respiratory Disease detected by RNA-Seq analysis, and/or 2) QTL identified in the association analysis of the imputed sequence variants. The model based on QTL selected variants is biased but when trained in one state generated BRD risk predictions with positive accuracies in the other state. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of sequence-based and biology-driven model development for genomic selection. Disease phenotypes cannot be routinely recorded in most livestock species and the observed phenotypes may vary in their genomic architecture due to variation in the pathogen composition across environments. Elucidation of trait biology and genetic architecture may guide the development of prediction models with utility across breeds and environments.

However, the ability to tune out background \u201Cnoise\u201D is essential to effectively utilizing Twitter to identify important and useful information during an emergency response. Methods: This article highlights a two-prong strategy in which the use of a Twitter list paired with subject specific Boolean searches provided increased situational awareness and early event detection during the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) response to Superstorm Sandy in 2012. To maximize the amount of relevant information that was retrieved, the Twitter list and Boolean searches were dynamic and responsive to real-time developments, evolving health threats, and the informational needs of decision-makers. Conclusion: The use of a Twitter list combined with Boolean searches led to enhanced situational awareness throughout the HHS response. The incorporation of a dynamic search strategy over the course of the HHS Sandy response, allowed for the ability to account for over-tweeted information, changes in event related conversation, and decreases in the return of relevant information.","publish_time":"2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harris Smith, Sara; Bennett, Kelly J.; Livinski, Alicia A.","journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4205228.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642372/; https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.dis.de9415573fbf90ee2c585cd0b2314547","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Department of Health and Human Services","HHS","Superstorm Sandy"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Twitter list","HHS response","HHS Sandy response","available information","useful information","emergency response operations","return of relevant information","ground situational awareness","over-tweeted information","increased situational awareness","subject specific Boolean searches","ability","Background","dynamic search strategy","real-time developments","prong strategy","Superstorm Sandy","early event detection","evolving health threats","event related conversation","United States Department of Health","Human Services","Office","changes","Preparedness","ASPR","course","Assistant Secretary","resources","informational needs of decision","critical source of free","communities","unmatched level","rumor control","makers","article","noise","incorporation","survivors","boots","Responders","Conclusion","Methods","disaster"],"language":"en"},

IRAK-M, a member of IRAK family, is a negative regulator in TLR signaling and specifically expresses in monocytes and macrophages. The role of IRAK-M in intracellular growth of M. tb and macrophage polarization was explored, for deeply understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb, the significance of IRAK-M to innate immunity and pathogen-host interaction. METHODS: IRAK-M expression was detected in M. tb infected macrophages and in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis with immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. IRAK-M knock-down and over-expressing cell strains were constructed and intracellular survival of M. tb was investigated by acid-fast staining and colony forming units. Molecular markers of M1-type (pSTAT1 and iNOS) and M2-type (pSTAT6 and Arg-1) macrophages were detected using Western blot in IRAK-M knockdown U937 cells infected with M. tb H37Rv. U937 cells were stimulated with immunostimulant CpG7909 into M1 status and then infected with M. tb H37Rv. Expression of IRAK-M, IRAK-4 and iNOS was detected with immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, to evaluate the effect of IRAK-M to CpG directed M1-type polarization of macrophages during M. tb infection. Molecules related with macrophage\u2019s bactericidal ability such as Hif-1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were detected with immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: IRAK-M increased in M. tb infected macrophage cells and also in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis. IRAK-M over-expression resulted in higher bacterial load, while IRAK-M interference resulted in lower bacterial load in M. tb infected cells. During M. tb infection, IRAK-M knockdown induced M1-type, while inhibited M2-type polarization of macrophage. M1-type polarization of U937 cells induced by CpG7909 was inhibited by M. tb infection, which was reversed by IRAK-M knockdown in U937 cells. IRAK-M affected Hif-1 and MAPK signaling cascade during M. tb infection. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, IRAK-M might alter the polarity of macrophages, to facilitate intracellular survival of M. tb and affect Th1-type immunity of the host, which is helpful to understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb.","publish_time":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Pei; Li, Quan; Ma, Jilei; Tian, Maopeng; Hong, Fei; Zhai, Xinjie; Li, Jianrong; Huang, Hanju; Shi, Chunwei","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41743a48f1acec724d627f76e02e85137debc076.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5569470.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28835201/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-017-1095-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. tb"],"organizations":["IRAK","CpG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Expression of IRAK","tb infection","tb infected cells","effect of IRAK","significance of IRAK","role of IRAK","tb infected macrophages","tb H37Rv","tb infected macrophage cells","member of IRAK family","M1-type polarization of macrophages","M1-type polarization of U937 cells","host cells","knockdown U937 cells","knockdown induced M1-type","Western blot","inhibited M2-type polarization of macrophage","macrophage polarization","polarity of macrophages","Th1-type immunity","M1 status","intracellular survival","immunofluorescence staining","Intracellular bacterium","intracellular growth","over-expression","Molecular markers of M1","human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","acid-fast staining","iNOS","immunohistochemistry","pathogenesis","lower bacterial load","higher bacterial load","pathogen-host interaction","innate immunity","immunostimulant CpG7909","affected Hif","over-expressing cell strains","MAPK","interference","pSTAT1","macrophage\u2019s bactericidal ability","negative regulator","BACKGROUND","pSTAT6","Arg","cascade","TLR","Molecules","colony","units","phosphorylated ERK1","monocytes","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The interaction between virus and host cells, critical for viral replication, is being extensively investigated by many laboratories. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HSV-1 lytic infection triggers the expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1. The mechanisms of induction are mediated, at least in part, by signaling pathways such as NF\u03BAB and CREB. METHODS: SIRC, VERO, and 293HEK cell lines were infected with HSV-1, and the Egr-1 transcript and protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The localization and expression profile of Egr-1 were investigated further by immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. The recruitment of transcription factors to the Egr-1 promoter during infection was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Various inhibitors and dominant-negative mutant were used to assess the mechanisms of Egr-1 induction and their effects were addressed by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Western blot analyses showed that Egr-1 was absent in uninfected cells; however, the protein was detected 24-72 hours post treatment, and the response was directly proportional to the titer of the virus used for infection. Using recombinant HSV-1 expressing EGFP, Egr-1 was detected only in the infected cells. ChIP assays demonstrated that NF\u043AB and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were recruited to the Egr-1 promoter upon infection. Additional studies showed that inhibitors of NF\u043AB and dominant-negative CREB repressed the Egr-1 induction by HSV-1 infection. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results demonstrate that Egr-1 is expressed rapidly upon HSV-1 infection and that this novel induction could be due to the NF\u043AB/CREB-mediated transactivation. Egr-1 induction might play a key role in the viral gene expression, replication, inflammation, and the disease progression.","publish_time":"2011-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bedadala, Gautam R; Palem, Jayavardhana R; Graham, Lorna; Hill, James M; McFerrin, Harris E; Hsia, Shao-Chung","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63cb88b9fee3f16bcf3666b4665e445325addf9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3120787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21619646/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-262","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CREB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of Egr","expression profile of Egr","lytic infection","recombinant HSV","mechanisms of induction","novel induction","dominant-negative CREB","inhibitors of NF\u043AB","CREB-mediated transactivation","viral gene expression","viral replication","host cells","Western blot analyses","uninfected cells","promoter","RESULTS","immunofluorescence microscopy analyses","dominant-negative mutant","cAMP response element binding protein","Herpes simplex virus type","Various inhibitors","ChIP assays","expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1","recruitment of transcription factors","simple cold sores","dangerous keratitis","inflammation","VERO","key role","number of diseases","lethal encephalitis","RT-PCR","HEK cell lines","BACKGROUND","hypothesis","titer","effects","chromatin immunoprecipitation","SIRC","infections","hours","Additional studies","interaction","localization","EGFP","disease progression","METHODS","treatment","pathways","NF\u03BAB","study","CONCLUSION","laboratories"],"language":"en"},

Intravaginally applied 3HP-\u03B2-LG-containing vaginal gel could significantly inhibit HPV infection and reduce viral load in the cervical region. However, we still do not understand the underlying molecular mechanism by which 3HP-\u03B2-LG is able to inhibit HPV infection. Here, though, we showed that 3HP-\u03B2-LG did not inactivate HPV PsV, but rather blocked entry of HPV PsV into the target cell via its interaction with virus, not cell. It bound to the positively charged region in the HPV L1 protein, suggesting that 3HP-\u03B2-LG binds to HPV L1 protein through the interaction between the negatively charged region in 3HP-\u03B2-LG and the positively charged region in HPV L1 protein, thus competitively blocking the binding of HPV to the receptor on the basement membrane in vaginal mucosa. Although 3HP-modified chicken ovalbumin (3HP-OVA) also carries high net negative charges, it exhibited no anti-HPV activity, suggesting that the interaction between 3HP-modified protein and HPV L1 protein relies on both electrostatic and matchable conformation of the binding sites in both proteins. When topically applied, 3HP-\u03B2-LG did not enter the host cell or blood circulation. These findings suggest that 3HP-\u03B2-LG targets HPV L1 protein and blocks HPV entry into the host cell, thus being safe and effective for topical application in the treatment of HPV infection.","publish_time":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Chen; Zhu, Yun; Wu, Congquan; Si, Lulu; Wang, Qian; Sui, Long; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fccc2cff358d6c08f512003b88bab9934e4ffa7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6775479.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV","HPV PsV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HP-\u03B2","binding of HPV","HP-modified protein","LG targets HPV L1 protein","HP-OVA","blocks HPV entry","treatment of HPV infection","anti-HPV activity","blocked entry of HPV PsV","HP-modified chicken ovalbumin","host cell","target cell","interaction","cervical region","inhibiting entry of pseudovirus","vaginal gel","binding sites","vaginal mucosa","high net negative charges","topical application","low-risk human papillomavirus","receptor","viral load","matchable conformation","basement membrane","bovine beta-lactoglobulin","underlying molecular mechanism","blood circulation","proteins","hydroxyphthalic anhydride","findings","Intravaginally"],"language":"en"},

This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. RESULTS: Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. SUMMARY: Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maglakelidze, Natella; Manto, Kristen M.; Craig, Timothy J.","journal":"Pulm Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d38db804cf2fd958db11b803e1cc73fcd812b66c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7218701.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405877/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41030-020-00118-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Subjects Protection Office"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus pathogenesis","study of coronavirus","Activation of complement","SARS-CoV","contact system","refractory edema","observed pulmonary edema","angiotensin receptor antagonists","lung disease","disease etiology","co-receptor","generation of bradykinin","COVID","respiratory arrest","traditional interventions","ethics guidelines","associated pneumonia","wild-type mice","precise therapeutic interventions","C3 knockout mice","institutional review board approval","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines","antiviral therapy","exempt","convalescent plasma","hydroxychloroquine","profound increase","ACE-inhibitors","anti-IL","Mouse models","presentation","antihistamines","cytokines","ARDS","recent literature","search","ACE2","PubMed","so-called cytokine storm","work","corticosteroids","RESULTS","azithromycin","death","evidence","benefit","risk","suspicions","reason","METHODS","potential treatments","INTRODUCTION","manuscript","enzyme","SUMMARY","roles","viruses","studies"],"language":"en"},

Since the analogs have interesting biochemical properties, these drugs are found to be effective against a wide variety of viral infections. As antiviral action, the analogs have been shown to inhibit acidification of endosome during the events of replication and infection. Moreover, immunomodulatory effects of analogs have been beneficial to patients with severe inflammatory complications of several viral diseases. Interestingly, one of the successful targeting strategies is the inhibition of HIV replication by the analogs in vitro which are being tested in several clinical trials.

The term \u2018zoonosis\u2019 is also considered to be shorter and more convenient than \u2018anthropozoonosis\u2019 (animals to humans) and \u2018zooanthroponosis\u2019 (humans to animals), which are based on the prevailing direction of transmission between humans and other vertebrates.","publish_time":"2014-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chomel, B.B.","journal":"Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49ca1775816ea4db56a4b0b1a203bc1a0e597094.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157467.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383024260; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128012383024260","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["humans","vertebrate animals","human diseases","vertebrate animal diseases","plural zoonoses","term","major concern","major primate center","non-human primates","combination","measles","exposure","Expert Committee","Greek words","Rudolph Virchow","century","noson","anthropozoonosis","World Health Organization","zooanthroponosis","prevailing direction of transmission","word zoonosis","infections","end","zoonosis\u2019","vertebrates"],"language":"en"},

However, very few studies have systematically compared HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence among MSM according to key venue type for sourcing sex partners. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between HIV/syphilis prevalence and the types of venues, namely saunas, parks, gay bars, and the Internet, which are mostly used for sourcing male sex partners by MSM in China. Methods Meta\u2010analyses using fixed\u2010effect and random\u2010effect methods were conducted. Secondary data were obtained from 10 concurrent surveys conducted in 10 cities basing on a common protocol. Pairwise comparisons (e.g., \u201Csaunas\u201D vs. \u201Cparks\u201D) were made. Main Outcomes Measures Odds ratios (OR) for HIV/syphilis infection in relations to venue type for partner sourcing. Results The distribution of the most commonly used source to recruit male sex partner was 59.32% (Internet), 18.47% (gay bars), 14.18% (gay saunas), and 8.02% (parks). The median prevalence of HIV/syphilis was 10.49% and 19.38% (gay saunas), 2.12% and 16.25% (parks), 6.06% and 15.45% (Internet), and 4.41% and 11.90% (gay bars). We found significant between\u2010group differences when comparing \u201Csauna\u201D against \u201CInternet\u201D (HIV: OR = 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.65\u20133.12; syphilis: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.07\u20132.41), \u201Csauna\u201D against \u201Cbars\u201D (HIV: OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.14\u20132.39; syphilis: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02\u20131.78), and \u201Cparks\u201D against \u201CInternet\u201D (syphilis: OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.12\u20132.15) as the main source to recruit male sex partners. Other pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that those sourcing partners mainly from gay saunas have higher prevalence of HIV/syphilis when compared with those doing so via the Internet or gay bars. Venue based (sauna\u2010based) interventions using socio\u2010ecological approaches are greatly warranted in order to reduce HIV and syphilis prevalence among MSM in China.

Analysis of steady state levels of negative strand RNA after the shift indicate that the group C mutants were probably blocked in the ability to synthesize additional minus strand RNA under conditions in which the group E mutants continued low levels of minus strand synthesis.

Moreover we present the outbreak control bundle and our concept for RSV screening in the winter season. RESULTS: RSV A and B strains caused the outbreak. RSV B strains affected 3 patients, 2 of whom were co-infected with RSV A. Exactly this RSV A strain was detected in another 5 patients. Our multimodal infection control bundle including prophylactic RSV screening was able to rapidly stop the outbreak. CONCLUSION: An infection control bundle in RSV outbreaks should address all potential transmission pathways. In pediatric settings the restriction of social activities might have a temporal negative impact on quality of life but helps to limit transmission opportunities. Molecular analysis allows better understanding of RSV outbreaks and, if done in a timely manner, might be helpful for guidance of infection control measures.","publish_time":"2018-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baier, Claas; Haid, Sibylle; Beilken, Andreas; Behnert, Astrid; Wetzke, Martin; Brown, Richard J.

Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.","publish_time":"2010-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Daihai; Ionides, Edward L.; King, Aaron A.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91b6e6a867abca446f467eeadcdbbfda198af6a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2842609.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2009.0151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19535416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["existing inference methods","inference framework applicable","Statistical inference","data","so-called plug","approach","dynamic systems","mechanistic models","substantial restrictions","nature of heterogeneity","environmental stochasticity","form of models","ecological systems","model misspecification","novel insights","novel methodology","extra-demographic stochasticity","modelling","importance","comment","means","answer questions","previous analyses","investigation of measles transmission dynamics","context","mixing","development","active area of research","small populations","scientific hypotheses","contrast","simulations","utility"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The research was developed with the Fulni-\u00F4 people in the municipality of \u00C1guas Belas, Agreste of Pernambuco, Northeast of Brazil. In order to do this, we applied snowball sampling to select the participants. Data from potentially useful game species were obtained from lists and semi-structured interviews to register their particular kind of uses, capture periods (daytime, night, or both), preferences, and perceived abundance. The hunters who allowed their game meat captured to be weighed and identified were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: Our records pointed to a vast repertoire of potentially hunting animals. However, we did not verify relationships between the abundance, seasonality, and biomass of the animals that were hunted by the Fulni-\u00F4. We observed a total of 209,866 (kg) of game meat hunted in the studied group, belonging to 23 species, distributed in three taxonomic groups, the birds being the most representative group with 59% of total reported. CONCLUSION: Such consumption by the group is well below in terms of biomass when compared to other ethnic or local groups in other regions of Brazil, or in Caatinga areas, characterizing an activity much more of cultural character than subsistence. Also, the use of game meat among the Fulni-\u00F4 seems to be actively directed to the preferred species, suggesting that in the case of an urbanized indigenous community, where other sources of income are available, the demand for game meat is lower when compared to other ethnic groups.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Silva, Josivan Soares; do Nascimento, Andr\u00E9 Luiz Borba; Alves, R\u00F4mulo Romeu N\u00F3brega; Albuquerque, Ulysses Paulino","journal":"J Ethnobiol Ethnomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7971344f9ec4a314830e7e1f88fe8d6348174553.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164412.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-020-00367-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["hunting of game meat","game meat hunted","use of game meat","useful game species","ethnic groups","biomass of wild animals","studied group","representative group","Fulni-\u00F4 people","seasonality","local groups","preferred species","taxonomic groups","perceived abundance","terms of biomass","total","regions of Brazil","Northeast of Brazil","municipality of \u00C1guas Belas","lists","particular kind","Agreste of Pernambuco","capture periods","semi-structured interviews","demand","sources of income","urbanized indigenous community","activity","night","case","birds","factors","Caatinga areas","records","cultural character","daytime","influence","vast repertoire","preferences","Data","snowball sampling","participants","subsistence","resources","research","proximity","CONCLUSION","consumption","environment","relationships","hunters","METHODS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","order","year"],"language":"en"},

Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is known to globally shut off host gene transcription in Sf21 cells and to modify their cytoskeletons. In this study, seven host genes were selected for validation as references for gene expression experiments using qRT-PCR. Two of them, ecdysoneless (ECD) and myosin showed stable RNA levels in our previous microarray study at 6, 12, and 24 hpi for both genes and 48 hpi for ECD. The others, actin, tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 28S ribosome (28S), are commonly employed as reference genes for qRT-PCR. Ribosomal protein L35 (L35) gene was selected to test if ribosomal protein genes show stable RNA transcript levels similar to 28S and 18S rRNA and to validate the microarray data. In addition to 28S, previously known to have stable transcript levels, qRT-PCR showed that ECD transcript levels remained constant throughout the time course of AcMNPV infection. Transcripts of cytoskeleton genes such as actin, tubulin, and myosin declined dramatically as the infection progressed. GAPDH and L35 transcripts also declined over time. These results indicate that ECD is a reliable reference gene for qRT-PCR experiments during AcMNPV infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Although 28S could be used as a reference gene for these experiments, it is less useful than ECD because of its abundance, which might make it difficult to establish an accurate baseline value for data analysis.","publish_time":"2014-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salem, Tamer Z.; Allam, Walaa R.; Thiem, Suzanne M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae88cd3f2ac21948c74fd7b15b62cc03e9bac235.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4196776.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313905/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108516","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Autographa"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reference genes","host genes","qRT-PCR experiments","ECD transcript levels","stable transcript levels","ribosomal protein genes","Transcripts of cytoskeleton genes","stable transcripts","S rRNA","S ribosome","stable RNA levels","reliable reference gene","gene expression experiments","L35 transcripts","stable RNA transcript levels similar","host gene transcription","time course of AcMNPV infection","viral infection","Ribosomal protein L35","AcMNPV infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells","tubulin","myosin","microarray data","GAPDH","actin","hpi","previous microarray study","Sf21 cells","data analysis","quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction","use","validation","references","accurate baseline value","glyceraldehyde","phosphate dehydrogenase","Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus","abundance","cytoskeletons","results","ecdysoneless","addition"],"language":"en"},

This pandemic probably originated in central Asia and began spreading westward along major trade routes. Upon the arrival in the eastern Mediterranean the disease quickly spread especially by sea traffic to Italy, Greece and France and later throughout Europe by land. Until the 18th century many European cities were frequently affected by other great plague epidemics. The worldwide spread of the third pandemic began when the plague reached Hong Kong and Canton in the year 1894. The gram-negative coccobacillus now designated as Yersinia pestis has been discovered as the causative agent of plague in this Hong Kong outbreak. In the following years the role of rats and fleas and their detailed role in the transmission of plague has been discovered and experimentally verified.

We estimated the burden of disease attributable to RSV in children in the UK between 1995 and 2009. DESIGN: Time-series regression modelling. SETTING: A multiple linear regression model based on weekly viral surveillance (RSV and influenza, Public Health England), and controlled for non-specific seasonal drivers of disease, estimated the proportion of general practitioner (GP) episodes of care (counted as first visit in a series within 28 days; Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD), hospitalisations (Hospital Episode Statistics, HES) and deaths (Office of National Statistics, ONS) attributable to RSV each season. PARTICIPANTS: Children 0\u201317 years registered with a GP in CPRD, or with a respiratory disease outcome in the HES or ONS databases. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: RSV-attributable burden of GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths due to respiratory disease by age. RSV-attributable burden associated with selected antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS: RSV-attributable respiratory disease in the UK resulted in an estimated 450 158 GP episodes, 29 160 hospitalisations and 83 deaths per average season in children and adolescents, with the highest proportions in children \u003C6 months of age (14 441/100 000 population, 4184/100 000 and 6/100 000, respectively). In an average season, there were an estimated 125 478 GP episodes for otitis media and 416 133 prescriptions for antibiotics attributable to RSV. More GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths from respiratory disease were attributable to RSV than to influenza in children under 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of RSV in children in the UK exceeds that of influenza. RSV in children and adolescents contributes substantially to GP office visits for a diverse range of illnesses, and was associated with an average 416 133 prescribed antibiotic courses per season. Effective antiviral treatments and preventive vaccines are urgently needed for the management of RSV infection in children.

Oocyst excretion peaked 7\u201314 days in the placebo group after the onset of diarrhoea, and during that period prevalence and intensity of excretion were significantly lower in the halofuginone-treated group compared to the sulfadimidine and the placebo control groups. The health status (diarrhoea, dehydration) declined in all groups but was significantly (P\u003C0.05\u20130.001) better in the halofuginone group in the first 2 weeks. Halofuginone effectively (P\u003C0.05\u20130.001) reduced oocyst excretion and improved the health status of the treated animals, while sulfadimidine had no effect against Cryptosporidium.","publish_time":"2003-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joachim, A; Krull, T; Schwarzkopf, J; Daugschies, A","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a481d214ce3b9166265e0a17af777c53fed0ede5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127554.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401703000062; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401703000062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Oocyst excretion","halofuginone group","halofuginone-treated group","health status","sulfadimidine","placebo group","intensity of excretion","onset of diarrhoea","cryptosporidiosis","period prevalence","treated animals","placebo control groups","week period","German state veterinary laboratories Cryptosporidium","placebo-controlled field study","minor importance","faecal consistency","year survey","questionnaire survey","faecal samples","suckling calves","parasite","times","dehydration","days","majority of researchers","oral drench","effect","Intervet","Halocur","Treatment","Abstract","post mortem","herd","weeks","half","cases"],"language":"en"},

Health professionals and community residents are main players in disaster responses but their knowledge levels of disaster medicine are not readily available. This study aimed to evaluate knowledge levels and training needs of disaster medicine among potential disaster responders and presented a necessity to popularize disaster medicine education. METHODS: A self-reporting questionnaire survey on knowledge level and training needs of disaster medicine was conducted in Shanghai, China, in 2012. A total of randomly selected 547 health professionals, 456 medical students, and 1,526 local residents provided intact information. The total response rate was 93.7%. RESULTS: Overall, 1.3% of these participants have received systematic disaster medicine training. News media (87.1%) was the most common channel to acquire disaster medicine knowledge. Although health professionals were more knowledgeable than community residents, their knowledge structure of disaster medicine was not intact. Medical teachers were more knowledgeable than medical practitioners and health administrators (p = 0.002). Clinicians performed better than public health physicians (p\u003C0.001), whereas public health students performed better than clinical medical students (p\u003C0.001). In community residents, education background significantly affected the knowledge level on disaster medicine (p\u003C0.001). Training needs of disaster medicine were generally high among the surveyed. \u2018Lecture\u2019 and \u2018practical training\u2019 were preferred teaching methods. The selected key and interested contents on disaster medicine training were similar between health professionals and medical students, while the priorities chosen by local residents were quite different from health professionals and medical students (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Traditional clinical-oriented medical education might lead to a huge gap between the knowledge level on disaster medicine and the current needs of disaster preparedness. Continuing medical education and public education plans on disaster medicine via media should be practice-oriented, and selectively applied to different populations and take the knowledge levels and training needs into consideration.","publish_time":"2013-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Tong; Han, Xue; Chen, Fei; Du, Yan; Zhang, Hongwei; Yin, Jianhua; Tan, Xiaojie; Chang, Wenjun; Ding, Yibo; Han, Yifang; Cao, Guangwen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c59d3a8be1e640d85fc5105dca9e530680c230a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3691157.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23826190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["disaster medicine knowledge","disaster medicine education","training needs of disaster medicine","knowledge levels of disaster medicine","knowledge structure of disaster medicine","systematic disaster medicine training","disaster responses","Health professionals","potential disaster responders","public health students","current needs of disaster preparedness","clinical medical students","health administrators","public health physicians","medical practitioners","Medical teachers","community residents","practical training","serious public health issue","Traditional clinical-oriented medical education","local residents","education background","public education plans","different populations","News media","selected key","intact information","preferred teaching methods","total response rate","main players","self-reporting questionnaire survey","contents","necessity","huge gap","CONCLUSIONS","priorities","participants","common channel","consideration","Clinicians","Shanghai","Lecture","China","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The organism adheres to and damages the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract. Affected pigs show chronic coughing, are more susceptible to other respiratory infections and have a reduced performance. Control of the disease can be accomplished in a number of ways. First, management practices and housing conditions in the herd should be optimized. These include all-in/all-out production, limiting factors that may destabilize herd immunity, maintaining optimal stocking densities, prevention of other respiratory diseases, and optimal housing and climatic conditions. Strategic medication with antimicrobials active against M. hyopneumoniae and, preferably, also against major secondary bacteria may be useful during periods when the pigs are at risk for respiratory disease. Finally, commercial bacterins are widely used to control M. hyopneumoniae infections. The main effects of vaccination include less clinical symptoms, lung lesions and medication use, and improved performance. However, bacterins provide only partial protection and do not prevent colonization of the organism. Different vaccination strategies (timing of vaccination, vaccination of sows, vaccination combined with antimicrobial medication) can be used, depending on the type of herd, the production system and management practices, the infection pattern and the preferences of the pig producer. Research on new vaccines is actively occurring, including aerosol and feed-based vaccines as well as subunit and DNA vaccines. Eradication of the infection at herd level based on age-segregation and medication is possible, but there is a permanent risk for re-infections.","publish_time":"2008-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maes, D.; Segales, J.; Meyns, T.; Sibila, M.; Pieters, M.; Haesebrouck, F.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8df2059007d938efd74aca9a370b93bd3536edde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130725.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507004506; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507004506","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","timing of vaccination","vaccination of sows","hyopneumoniae infections","medication use","herd level","herd immunity","respiratory diseases","Strategic medication","antimicrobial medication","type of herd","respiratory tract","Different vaccination strategies","main effects of vaccination","optimal housing","management practices","housing conditions","pigs","DNA vaccines","new vaccines","feed-based vaccines","re-infections","organism","Control","Abstract Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae","infection pattern","production system","pig industry","all-out production","permanent risk","climatic conditions","improved performance","pig producer","reduced performance","commercial bacterins","optimal stocking densities","major secondary bacteria","major economic losses","clinical symptoms","lung lesions","age-segregation","primary pathogen of enzootic pneumonia","periods","factors","prevention","preferences","antimicrobials active","aerosol","subunit","ciliated epithelium","colonization","partial protection","chronic coughing","Eradication","Research","number of ways"],"language":"en"},

We recently showed the presence of both epitope M133-specific Tregs (M133 Treg) and conventional CD4 T cells (M133 Tconv) in the brains of mice with coronavirus-induced encephalitis. Here, we provide new insights into the interactions between pathogenic Tconv and Tregs responding to the same epitope. M133 Tregs inhibited the proliferation but not initial activation of M133 Tconv in draining lymph nodes (DLN). Further, M133 Tregs inhibited migration of M133 Tconv from the DLN. In addition, M133 Tregs diminished microglia activation and decreased the number and function of Tconv in the infected brain. Thus, virus-specific Tregs inhibited pathogenic CD4 T cell responses during priming and effector stages, particularly those recognizing cognate antigen, and decreased mortality and morbidity without affecting virus clearance. These cells are more suppressive than bulk Tregs and provide a targeted approach to ameliorating immunopathological disease in infectious settings.","publish_time":"2014-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jingxian; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ee32c492fb088bca33f2b2409baa37d488dae5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4125232.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DLN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["M133 Tregs inhibited migration of M133 Tconv","epitope M133-specific Tregs","bulk Tregs","initial activation of M133 Tconv","virus-specific Tregs","M133 Tregs diminished microglia activation","pathogenic Tconv","conventional CD4 T cells","CD4 regulatory T cells","function of Tconv","pathogenic CD4 T cell responses","effector T cell responses","specific Foxp3","bulk Treg populations","DLN","effector stages","decreased mortality","virus clearance","presence of pathogen","infected brain","infected animals","targeted approach","ameliorating immunopathological disease","draining lymph nodes","cognate antigen","morbidity","number","brains of mice","interactions","addition","proliferation","infectious settings","coronavirus-induced encephalitis","new insights","studies"],"language":"en"},

The complement system is involved in atherogenesis, and the complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role facilitating the clearance of immune complexes from the circulation. Limited evidence suggests that CR1 may be involved in cardiovascular disease. We investigated the relationship between CR1 gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk. Methods Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region (n = 73) on chromosome 1 were assessed in 5244 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Logistic regression, adjusted for gender, age, country and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cardiovascular disease. Results All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. In this region, strong LD was present leading to the occurrence of two haploblocks. Twelve of the 73 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (all p \u003C 0.05). Moreover, most of the associated SNPs were also associated with levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected. Conclusions These data indicate that genetic variation within the CR1 gene is associated with inflammation and the risk of incident coronary artery disease.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Vries, Marijke A.; Trompet, Stella; Mooijaart, Simon P.; Smit, Roelof A.J.; B\u00F6hringer, Stefan; Castro Cabezas, Manuel; Jukema, J.

Cisplatin is generally used in clinic for gastric cancer treatment but with toxic side effects and develops resistance. Anti-tumor properties of copper and its coordinated compounds have been explored intensively in recent years. METHODS: In this study, we synthesized a novel Schiff base copper coordinated compound (SBCCC) and examined its antitumor effects in two gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901 and BGC-823 as well as a mouse model of gastric cancer. RESULTS: The results show that SBCCC can significantly inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50 of SBCCC in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells is 1 \u03BCM, which is much less than cisplatin\u2019s IC50. SBCCC induces apoptosis and causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. SBCCC induces apoptosis via multiple pathways including inhibition of NF-\u03BAB, ROS production and autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: The synthesized SBCCC induced cancer cell death via inhibition of NF-\u03BAB, ROS production and autophagy. The multiple cell-killing mechanisms were important to overcome therapeutic failure because of multidrug-resistance of cancer cells. SBCCC, with a lower IC50 compared to cisplatin, could render it the potential to overcome the side-effect for clinical application.","publish_time":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Yan; Liu, Xingkai; Zhang, Luping; Zhang, Jinzhu; Li, Chaoying; Zhang, Nan; Xu, Hong; Li, Yan","journal":"Cancer Cell Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5f1d681eb128c9c044a7f5ced6e0e943b201e93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6448317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988662/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-019-0801-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SBCCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IC50 of SBCCC","gastric cancer treatment","proliferation of gastric cancer cells","gastric cancer cell lines SGC","synthesized SBCCC induced cancer cell death","mouse model of gastric cancer","multiple cell","inhibition of NF","\u03BAB","cell cycle arrest","ROS production","apoptosis","BGC","autophagy","lower IC50","RESULTS","cisplatin\u2019s IC50","antitumor effects","coordinated compounds","multiple pathways","multidrug-resistance","novel Schiff base copper coordinated compound","Anti-tumor properties of copper","dose","architectural heterogeneity","therapeutic failure","multifactorial disorders","mechanisms","gastrointestinal cancers","G1 phase","CONCLUSIONS","time-dependent manner","side-effect","study","potential","clinical application","\u03BCM","BACKGROUND","recent years","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Planning for, and responses to, such events must include healthcare and other measures based on current evidence. An important area of infection prevention and control (IPC) is the optimal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers (HCWs), including masks for protection against respiratory pathogens. Appropriate mask use during routine care is a forerunner to best practice in the event of an outbreak. However, little is known about the influences on decisions and behaviours of HCWs with respect to protective mask use when providing routine care. In this paper we argue that there is a need for more research to provide a better understanding of the decision-making and risk-taking behaviours of HCWs in respect of their use of masks for infectious disease prevention. Our argument is based on the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases; a need to strengthen workforce capability, capacity and education; the financial costs of healthcare and outbreaks; and the importance of social responsibility and supportive legislation in planning for global security. Future research should examine HCWs\u0027 practices and constructs of risk to provide new information to inform policy and pandemic planning.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barratt, Ruth; Shaban, Ramon Z.; Gilbert, Gwendoline L.","journal":"Infection, Disease \u0026 Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/451b3ca0a07f23d78733b732f27d62a44e5a376e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129171.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468045119300045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799181/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2019.01.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468045119300045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of masks","protective mask use","risk-taking behaviours of HCWs","Appropriate mask use","respect","routine care","infectious disease prevention","healthcare workers","pandemic planning","need","optimal use of personal protective equipment","ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases","financial costs of healthcare","Abstract Outbreaks of emerging","global security","global threats","Future research","important area of infection prevention","supportive legislation","PPE","control","capacity","education","forerunner","importance of social responsibility","new information","best practice","constructs of risk","practices","decision-making","IPC","better understanding","workforce capability","measures","policy","protection","society","decisions","respiratory pathogens","events","influences","current evidence","argument","responses"],"language":"en"},

Notably, failure to detect these neoplasms at an early stage represents a fundamental barrier to improving the survival and quality of life of OSCC patients. In the present study, serum samples from OSCC patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and silver staining in order to identify biomarkers that might allow early diagnosis. In this regard, 2-DE spots corresponding to various up- and down-regulated proteins were sequenced via high-resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and analyzed using the MASCOT database. We identified the following differentially expressed host-specific proteins within sera from OSCC patients: leucine-rich \u03B12-glycoprotein (LRG), alpha-1-B-glycoprotein (ABG), clusterin (CLU), PRO2044, haptoglobin (HAP), complement C3c (C3), proapolipoprotein A1 (proapo-A1), and retinol-binding protein 4 precursor (RBP4). Moreover, five non-host factors were detected, including bacterial antigens from Acinetobacter lwoffii, Burkholderia multivorans, Myxococcus xanthus, Laribacter hongkongensis, and Streptococcus salivarius. Subsequently, we analyzed the immunogenicity of these proteins using pooled sera from OSCC patients. In this regard, five of these candidate biomarkers were found to be immunoreactive: CLU, HAP, C3, proapo-A1 and RBP4. Taken together, our immunoproteomics approach has identified various serum biomarkers that could facilitate the development of early diagnostic tools for OSCC.","publish_time":"2014-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yeng; Azman, Siti Nuraishah; Kerishnan, Jesinda P.; Zain, Rosnah Binti; Chen, Yu Nieng; Wong, Yin-Ling; Gopinath, Subash C.

The same holds true for the significance of the unique interspecies (fish/birds vs mammals) variability in the capacity to bind lactose. In solution, ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering (at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL) characterize the protein as compact and stable homodimer without evidence for aggregation. The crystal structure of chicken (C-)GRIFIN at seven pH values from 4.2 to 8.5 is reported, revealing compelling stability. Binding of lactose despite the Arg71Val deviation from the sequence signature of galectins matched the otherwise canonical contact pattern with thermodynamics of an enthalpically driven process. Upon lactose accommodation, the side chain of Arg50 is shifted for hydrogen bonding to the 3-hydroxyl of glucose. No evidence for a further ligand-dependent structural alteration was obtained in solution by measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometrically in peptic fingerprints. The introduction of the Asn48Lys mutation, characteristic for mammalian GRIFINs that have lost lectin activity, lets labeled C-GRIFIN maintain capacity to stain tissue sections. Binding is no longer inhibitable by lactose, as seen for the wild-type protein. These results establish the basis for detailed structure-activity considerations and are a step to complete the structural description of all seven members of the galectin network in chicken.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruiz, Federico M.; Gilles, Ulrich; Ludwig, Anna-Kristin; Sehad, Celia; Shiao, Tze Chieh; Garc\u00EDa Caballero, Gabriel; Kaltner, Herbert; Lindner, Ingo; Roy, Ren\u00E9; Reusch, Dietmar; Romero, Antonio; Gabius, Hans-Joachim","journal":"Biochimie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1141c480cc6ab01d00721ee772ea39d4b74eb615.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115793.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908417303334; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248541/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908417303334","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Binding"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Binding of lactose","C-GRIFIN","lactose accommodation","solution","capacity","evidence","crystal structure of chicken","wild-type protein","galectin-related inter-fiber protein","detailed structure-activity considerations","lectin activity","galectin network","hydrogen bonding","structural description","ligand-dependent structural alteration","fish","birds vs mammals","thermodynamics","lenses of vertebrates","mammalian GRIFINs","variability","small angle X-ray scattering","deuterium exchange mass","Arg71Val deviation","canonical contact pattern","significance","Asn48Lys mutation","characteristic","sequence signature of galectins","physiological function","ultracentrifugation","basis","stable homodimer","members","natural abundance","stain tissue sections","enthalpically driven process","peptic fingerprints","concentrations","chain of Arg50","step","Abstract","introduction","aggregation","results","holds true","pH values","hydroxyl of glucose","compelling stability"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in MM patients with hepatitis B in China. METHODS: From 2006 to 2011, 739 newly diagnosed MM patients were screened for serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) biomarkers. HBV-infected patients were followed for HBV reactivation by monitoring of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and HBV DNA load. The pattern of HBV reactivation in relation to bortezomib was evaluated. Seven hundred thirty-nine MM patients were included in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of MM patients infected with HBV was 3.4% (n = 25), of which 17 cases were treated with bortezomib. Bortezomib had no significant influence on liver function (ALT before and after treatment: 36.69 \u00B1 8.90 U/L vs. 11.31 \u00B1 2.74 U/L, P = 0.19) and HBV DNA of MM patients with HBV (detectable HBV DNA percentage: 5.9% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.12).

We used genital HSV-2 infection of guinea pigs to assess the type and location of HSV-specific memory cells at peripheral sites of HSV-2 infection. HSV-specific antibody-secreting cells were readily detected in the spleen, bone marrow, vagina/cervix, lumbosacral sensory ganglia, and spinal cord of previously-infected animals. Memory B cells were detected primarily in the spleen and to a lesser extent in bone marrow but not in the genital tract or neural tissues suggesting that the HSV-specific antibody-secreting cells present at peripheral sites of HSV-2 infection represented persisting populations of plasma cells. The antibody produced by these cells isolated from neural tissues of infected animals was functionally relevant and included antibodies specific for HSV-2 glycoproteins and HSV-2 neutralizing antibodies. A vigorous IFN-\u03B3-secreting T cell response developed in the spleen as well as the sites of HSV-2 infection in the genital tract, lumbosacral ganglia and spinal cord following acute HSV-2 infection. Additionally, populations of HSV-specific tissue-resident memory T cells were maintained at these sites and were readily detected up to 150 days post HSV-2 infection. Unlike the persisting plasma cells, HSV-specific memory T cells were also detected in uterine tissue and cervicothoracic region of the spinal cord and at low levels in the cervicothoracic ganglia. Both HSV-specific CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) resident memory cell subsets were maintained long-term in the genital tract and sensory ganglia/spinal cord following HSV-2 infection. Together these data demonstrate the long-term maintenance of both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune response at the sites of HSV-2 latency and virus shedding and highlight the utility of the guinea pig infection model to investigate tissue-resident memory in the setting of HSV-2 latency and spontaneous reactivation.","publish_time":"2014-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Jingya; Veselenak, Ronald L.; Gorder, Summer R.; Bourne, Nigel; Milligan, Gregg N.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4259353.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485971/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0114652","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genital HSV","populations of HSV","location of HSV","acute HSV","setting of HSV","modulating HSV","HSV-specific memory T cells","HSV-specific CD4","peripheral sites of HSV","HSV-specific antibody-secreting cells","specific memory cells","days post HSV","specific tissue-resident memory T cells","Memory B cells","antibodies specific","resident immune memory","persisting plasma cells","spinal cord","persisting populations of plasma cells","infection of guinea pigs","resident memory cell subsets","genital tract","lumbosacral ganglia","cervicothoracic ganglia","guinea pig infection model","spleen","lumbosacral sensory ganglia","nature of tissue","uterine tissue","secreting T cell response","bone marrow","neural tissues of infected animals","latency","adaptive immune response","long-term maintenance","cervicothoracic region","neutralizing antibodies","vagina","cellular arms","cervix","glycoproteins","utility","vigorous IFN-\u03B3","pathogenesis","low levels","type","CD8","lesser extent","importance","spontaneous reactivation","virus","data"],"language":"en"},

Objective We wished to determine whether asthmatic children requiring emergency department treatment for exacerbations after school return in September were more likely to have respiratory viruses present and less likely to have prescriptions for control medications than children with equally severe asthma not requiring emergent treatment. Methods Rates of viral detection and characteristics of asthma management in 57 (of 60) children age 5 to 15 years presenting to emergency departments with asthma in 2 communities in Canada between September 10 and 30, 2001, (cases) were compared with those in 157 age-matched volunteer children with asthma of comparable severity studied simultaneously (controls). Results Human picornaviruses were detected in 52% of cases and 29% of controls (P =.002) and viruses of any type in 62% of cases and 41% of controls (P =.011). Cases were less likely to have been prescribed controller medication (inhaled corticosteroid, 49% vs 85%; P \u003C .0001; leukotriene receptor antagonist, 9% vs 21%; P =.04). Conclusion Respiratory viruses were detected in the majority of children presenting to emergency departments with asthma during the September epidemic of the disease and in a significant minority of children with asthma in the community. The latter were more likely to have anti-inflammatory medication prescriptions than children requiring emergent treatment.

The model includes immunization of susceptible people (S), quarantine (Q) of exposed people (E), isolation (J) of infectious people (I), a recovered population (R), and variation in population size due to natural births and deaths and deaths of infected people. It is shown analytically that the model has a disease-free equilibrium state which always exists and an endemic equilibrium state which exists if and only if the disease-free state is unstable. A simple formula is obtained for a generalized reproduction number R g where, for any given initial population, R g \u003C 1 means that the initial population is locally asymptotically stable and R g \u003E 1 means that the initial population is unstable. As special cases, simple formulas are given for the basic reproduction number R 0 , a disease-free reproduction number R d f , and an endemic reproduction number R e n . Formulas are derived for the sensitivity indices for variations in model parameters of the disease-free reproduction number R d f and for the infected populations in the endemic equilibrium state. A simple formula in terms of the basic reproduction number R 0 is derived for the critical immunization level required to prevent the spread of disease in an initially disease-free population. Numerical simulations are carried out using the Matlab program for parameters corresponding to the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore in 2002 and 2003. From the sensitivity analyses for these four regions, the parameters are identified that are the most important for preventing the spread of disease in a disease-free population or for reducing infection in an infected population. The results support the importance of isolating infectious individuals in an epidemic and in maintaining a critical level of immunity in a population to prevent a disease from occurring.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siriprapaiwan, Supatcha; Moore, Elvin J.; Koonprasert, Sanoe","journal":"Mathematics and Computers in Simulation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44ef99ae7f76320a4bb1ee7d63e4d8d6690be610.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127447.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475417303440; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2017.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288111/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378475417303440","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","Hong Kong","Canada"],"keyphrases":["disease-free population","basic reproduction number R","recovered population","disease-free reproduction number R d f","generalized reproduction number R g","disease-free state","given initial population","endemic reproduction number R e n","disease-free equilibrium state","varying population size","model parameters","endemic equilibrium state","deaths of infected people","infectious people","spread of disease","immunization of susceptible people","exposed people","simple formulas","SEQIJR model of epidemic disease transmission","critical immunization level","infected populations","critical level of immunity","sensitivity indices","sensitivity analyses","importance of isolating infectious individuals","SARS","Beijing","quarantine","outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome","isolation","natural births","terms","Hong Kong","variations","Canada","infection","Singapore","results","Matlab program","special cases","regions","Numerical simulations"],"language":"en"},

Since stigma is created and reinforced by society\u2014through in-person and online social interactions\u2014referencing the novel coronavirus as the \u201CChinese virus\u201D or \u201CChina virus\u201D has the potential to create and perpetuate stigma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess if there was an increase in the prevalence and frequency of the phrases \u201CChinese virus\u201D and \u201CChina virus\u201D on Twitter after the March 16, 2020, US presidential reference of this term. METHODS: Using the Sysomos software (Sysomos, Inc), we extracted tweets from the United States using a list of keywords that were derivatives of \u201CChinese virus.\u201D We compared tweets at the national and state levels posted between March 9 and March 15 (preperiod) with those posted between March 19 and March 25 (postperiod). We used Stata 16 (StataCorp) for quantitative analysis, and Python (Python Software Foundation) to plot a state-level heat map. RESULTS: A total of 16,535 \u201CChinese virus\u201D or \u201CChina virus\u201D tweets were identified in the preperiod, and 177,327 tweets were identified in the postperiod, illustrating a nearly ten-fold increase at the national level. All 50 states witnessed an increase in the number of tweets exclusively mentioning \u201CChinese virus\u201D or \u201CChina virus\u201D instead of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or coronavirus. On average, 0.38 tweets referencing \u201CChinese virus\u201D or \u201CChina virus\u201D were posted per 10,000 people at the state level in the preperiod, and 4.08 of these stigmatizing tweets were posted in the postperiod, also indicating a ten-fold increase. The 5 states with the highest number of postperiod \u201CChinese virus\u201D tweets were Pennsylvania (n=5249), New York (n=11,754), Florida (n=13,070), Texas (n=14,861), and California (n=19,442). Adjusting for population size, the 5 states with the highest prevalence of postperiod \u201CChinese virus\u201D tweets were Arizona (5.85), New York (6.04), Florida (6.09), Nevada (7.72), and Wyoming (8.76). The 5 states with the largest increase in pre- to postperiod \u201CChinese virus\u201D tweets were Kansas (n=697/58, 1202%), South Dakota (n=185/15, 1233%), Mississippi (n=749/54, 1387%), New Hampshire (n=582/41, 1420%), and Idaho (n=670/46, 1457%). CONCLUSIONS: The rise in tweets referencing \u201CChinese virus\u201D or \u201CChina virus,\u201D along with the content of these tweets, indicate that knowledge translation may be occurring online and COVID-19 stigma is likely being perpetuated on Twitter.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Budhwani, Henna; Sun, Ruoyan","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205030.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Stigma"],"organizations":["Python (Python Software Foundation"],"locations":["United States","Arizona"],"keyphrases":["Chinese virus","China virus","number of tweets","stigmatizing tweets","fold increase","highest number of postperiod","highest prevalence of postperiod","United States","largest increase","preperiod","national level","New York","novel coronavirus","state levels","coronavirus disease","Sysomos software","state-level heat map","COVID","New Hampshire","Twitter","Florida","Python Software Foundation","members of groups","structural force","quantitative analysis","frequency","Arizona","list of keywords","social interactions","derivatives","phrases","rise","Pennsylvania","Kansas","US presidential reference","term","person","StataCorp","undesirable characteristics","total","people","potential","knowledge translation","OBJECTIVE","aim","study","Nevada","society","BACKGROUND","METHODS","population size","South Dakota","CONCLUSIONS","Texas","California","average","content","Wyoming","RESULTS","Mississippi","Idaho"],"language":"en"},

So far, however, few published study has addressed the need for manpower reallocation needed in hospitals when such a serious contagious outbreak occurs. AIM: To quantify the demand elasticity of the major surgery types in order to guide future manpower reallocation during contagious outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a nationwide research database in Taiwan, we extracted the monthly volumes of major surgery types for the period 1998\u20132003, which covered the SARS period, in order to carry out a time series analysis. The demand elasticity of each surgery type was then estimated by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, the surgical volumes of most selected surgery types either increased or remained steady. We categorized these surgery types into low-, moderate- and high-elastic groups according to their demand elasticity. Appendectomy, \u2018open reduction of fracture with internal fixation\u2019 and \u2018free skin graft\u2019 were in the low demand elasticity group. Transurethral prostatectomy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) were in the high demand elasticity group. The manpower of the departments carrying out the surgeries with low demand elasticity should be maintained during outbreaks. In contrast, departments in charge of surgeries mainly with high demand elasticity, like urology departments, may be in a position to have part of their staff reallocated. CONCLUSIONS: Taking advantage of the demand variation during the SARS period in 2003, we adopted the concept of demand elasticity and used a time series approach to figure out an effective index of demand elasticity for various types of surgery that could be used as a rational reference to carry out manpower reallocation during contagious outbreak situations.","publish_time":"2015-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsao, Hsiao-Mei; Sun, Ying-Chou; Liou, Der-Ming","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29e893a01ad314a8432d5948be971e13e48b9103.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4383619.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25837596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concept of demand elasticity","high demand elasticity group","low demand elasticity group","demand variation","effective index of demand elasticity","various types of surgery","selected surgery types","monthly volumes of major surgery types","study period","SARS period","future manpower reallocation","contagious outbreaks","serious contagious outbreak","order","urology departments","contagious outbreak situations","time series analysis","high-elastic groups","time series approach","surgical volumes","serious threats","charge of surgeries","published study","internal fixation","ESWL","hospitals","autoregressive integrated moving average","open reduction of fracture","extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy","Taiwan","ARIMA","need","Emerging infectious diseases","free skin graft","Transurethral prostatectomy","global public health","nationwide research database","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Appendectomy","contrast","advantage","rational reference","position","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","AIM","staff","MATERIALS"],"language":"en"},

Study design National cross-sectional study. Methods One thousand two hundred and eighty-one respondents were selected at random from provincial and prefectural CDCs. The survey used a self-administered, structured questionnaire with an online data collection tool that integrated data quality control and user management. The questionnaire was divided into seven main categories. Score percentage of satisfaction and proportion in each part were calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data, stratifying by country region, CDC level, job role and educational level. Results One hundred and sixty staff from provincial CDCs and 1121 staff from prefectural CDCs were selected. Only 7.4% (33/445) of prefectural CDCs were not involved in this survey, due to lack of PHI practitioners. CDC staff in the eastern region were predominantly aged 30\u201339 years (39.5%), which was much younger compared with the other regions (P = 0.0012). Only 34 respondents (2.7%) had academic majors in both health and information technology. More staff had Master\u0027s degrees and a higher level of education (18.7%) in the eastern region compared with the other regions (P \u003C 0.0001). Staff in the eastern region in high-level positions and with a higher level of education were more knowledgeable about PHI strategy. Prefectural CDC staff were more satisfied with their work and training than provincial CDC staff. In the eastern region, 34.9% of staff were hired through competitive recruitment, and 57.8% of staff had received a job description with detailed information about their responsibilities, which was higher than in the other regions. Staff in the western region were more likely to leave if a better job became available (37.7%) compared with staff in the other regions (P = 0.0116). Conclusion This study found regional disparities in PHI workforce development, possibly related to disparities in overall regional development. Findings showed a severe shortage of staff with a background in PHI, and occupational development paths were clearly lacking. Based on this study of current workforce issues, a comprehensive strategy for PHI workforce development in China has been described.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, X.; Wang, Y.; Xia, L.; Meng, Y.; Li, Y.; Yu, S.; Su, X.; Jin, S.; Ge, H.; Zhang, Y.; Zhuang, D.; Ma, J.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95d9bac431797e2cf8b7294a648ceec3bd50c84b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111694.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350615001109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25904003/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2015.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350615001109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","PHI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Prefectural CDC staff","provincial CDC staff","PHI workforce development","prefectural CDCs","eastern region","severe shortage of staff","provincial CDCs","PHI strategy","CDC level","regions","regional development","country region","western region","study of current workforce issues","higher level of education","prefectural centers","lack of PHI practitioners","educational level","occupational development paths","Study design National cross-sectional study","data quality control","job role","job description","regional disparities","better job","China","survey","respondents","online data collection tool","disease control","comprehensive strategy","structured questionnaire","current situation","detailed information","information technology","public health informatics","prevention","background","high-level positions","training","Master\u0027s degrees","academic majors","responsibilities","user management","Score percentage of satisfaction","proportion","Abstract Objective","Findings","Conclusion","corresponding strategies","competitive recruitment","main categories","Descriptive statistics","future","younger","Results","Methods","years"],"language":"en"},

The survey was conducted at 17 hospitals and the methods included a questionnaire, site visits and interviews. Nine hospitals had manuals on nosocomial infection control, and seven had an infection control committee (ICC). The number of hospitals that met the required amount of personal protective equipment preparation was as follows: gowns (13), gloves (13), surgical masks (12). Six hospitals had carried out in-service training over the past one year, but seven hospitals responded that no staff had been trained. Eight hospitals were conducting surveillance based on the results of bacteriological testing. The major problems included inadequate management of ICC, insufficient training opportunities for hospital staff, and lack of essential equipment.

In contrast, DIDS treatment decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. We investigated whether there is a difference in ion channel activity of the E protein between viral serotypes using E. coli cells expressing the E protein of FIPV serotypes I and II.

By capturing exogenous antigens and presenting antigen-derived peptides via major histocompatibility complex molecules to na\u00EFve T cells, DCs induce antigen-specific immune responses in vivo. In order to induce effective host immune responses, active delivery of exogenous antigens to DCs is considered important for future vaccine development. We recently generated bionanocapsules (BNCs) consisting of hepatitis B virus surface antigens that mediate stringent in vivo cell targeting and efficient endosomal escape, and after the fusion with liposomes (LP) containing therapeutic materials, the BNC-LP complexes deliver them to human liver-derived tissues in vivo. BNCs were further modified to present the immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc-interacting domain (Z domain) derived from Staphylococcus aureus protein A in tandem. When mixed with IgGs, modified BNCs (ZZ-BNCs) displayed the IgG Fv regions outwardly for efficient binding to antigens in an oriented-immobilization manner. Due to the affinity of the displayed IgGs, the IgG-ZZ-BNC complexes accumulated in specific cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo. After mixing ZZ-BNCs with antibodies against DCs, we used immunocytochemistry to examine which antibodies delivered ZZ-BNCs to mouse splenic DCs following intravenous injection of the ZZ-BNCs. ZZ-BNCs displaying anti-CD11c monoclonal antibodies (\u03B1-CD11c-ZZ-BNCs) were found to accumulate with approximately 62% of splenic DCs, and reside within some of them. After the fusion with liposomes containing antigens, the \u03B1-CD11c-ZZ-BNCs could elicit the respective antibodies more efficiently than other nontargeting control vaccines, suggesting that this DC-specific nanocarrier is promising for future vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsuo, Hidenori; Yoshimoto, Nobuo; Iijima, Masumi; Niimi, Tomoaki; Jung, Joohee; Jeong, Seong-Yun; Choi, Eun Kyung; Sewaki, Tomomitsu; Arakawa, Takeshi; Kuroda, Shun\u2019ichi","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6a5a00ad9468ae27a3a1c7cc33c2131297fbaa9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3405891.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s32813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22848163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZZ-BNCs","modified BNCs","IgG-ZZ","splenic DCs","specific cells","\u03B1-CD11c","antigen-specific immune responses","respective antibodies","active delivery of exogenous antigens","anti-CD11c monoclonal antibodies","na\u00EFve T cells","BNC-LP complexes","BNC complexes","Dendritic cells","liposomes","future vaccines","fusion","hepatitis B virus surface antigens","presenting antigen-derived peptides","effective host immune responses","human liver-derived tissues","key regulators of adaptive T-cell responses","IgG Fv regions","DC-specific nanocarrier","efficient binding","Z domain","efficient endosomal escape","nontargeting control vaccines","future vaccine development","major histocompatibility complex molecules","Fc","therapeutic materials","intravenous injection","Staphylococcus aureus protein","order","immunocytochemistry","oriented-immobilization manner","tandem","immunoglobulin G","generated bionanocapsules","affinity"],"language":"en"},

The transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has been proposed to be as a result of contact with camels, but evidence of human-to-human transmission also exists. In order to work with MERS-CoV in a laboratory setting, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that MERS-CoV should be handled at a biosafety level (BSL) 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. Many processes and procedures used to characterize MERS-CoV and to evaluate samples from MERS-CoV infected animals are more easily and efficiently completed at BSL-2 or lower containment. In order to complete experimental work at BSL-2, demonstration or proof of inactivation is required before removal of specimens from biocontainment laboratories. In the studies presented here, we evaluated typical means of inactivating viruses prior to handling specimens at a lower biocontainment level. We found that Trizol, AVL buffer and gamma irradiation were effective at inactivating MERS-CoV, that formaldehyde-based solutions required at least 30 minutes of contact time in a cell culture system while a mixture of methanol and acetone required 60 minutes to inactivate MERS-CoV. Together, these data provide a foundation for safely inactivating MERS-CoV, and potentially other coronaviruses, prior to removal from biocontainment facilities.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Mia; Mazur, Steven; Ork, Britini L.; Postnikova, Elena; Hensley, Lisa E.; Jahrling, Peter B.; Johnson, Reed; Holbrook, Michael R.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de3298c9d55af9dff18290db89948127a4941e3f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6978ee0afded8332afe71149609ac953fdc78679.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4555185.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415002359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190637/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415002359; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.07.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["inactivating MERS-CoV","transmission of MERS","MERS-CoV infected animals","BSL","lower biocontainment level","biocontainment facilities","biocontainment laboratories","human transmission","removal of specimens","evidence of human","biosafety level","order","minutes of contact time","number of human infections","handling specimens","typical means of inactivating viruses","result of contact","lower containment","experimental work","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","gamma irradiation","US Centers","cell culture system","samples","Disease Control","laboratory setting","Prevention","AVL buffer","mixture of methanol","deaths","formaldehyde-based solutions","Trizol","proof of inactivation","camels","CDC","demonstration","acetone","coronaviruses","foundation","emerged virus","procedures","humans","data","processes","studies"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, enveloped viruses have evolved membrane-fusion mediating glycoproteins that, once activated, refold, and release energy that fuses viral and cellular membranes. The influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein is a prototypic structural class I viral fusion glycoprotein that, once primed by proteolytic cleavage, is activated by endosomal low pH to form a fusogenic \u201Cleash-in-grooves\u201D hairpin structure. Low-pH induced HA protein refolding is an irreversible process, so acid exposure in the absence of a target membrane leads to virus inactivation. The HA proteins of diverse influenza virus subtypes isolated from a variety of species differ in their acid stabilities, or pH values at which irreversible HA protein conformational changes are triggered. Recently, efficient replication of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses such as H5N1 in avian species has been associated with a relatively high HA activation pH. In contrast, a decrease in H5N1 HA activation pH has been shown to enhance replication and airborne transmission in mammals. Mutations that alter the acid stabilities of H1 and H3 HA proteins have also been discovered that influence the amantadine susceptibilities, replication rates, and pathogenicities of human influenza viruses. An understanding of the role of HA acid stability in influenza virus biology is expected to aid in identifying emerging viruses with increased pandemic potential and assist in developing live attenuated virus vaccines. Acid-induced HA protein activation, which has provided a paradigm for protein-mediated membrane fusion, is now identified as a novel determinant of influenza virus biology.","publish_time":"2014-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, Charles J.","journal":"Influenza Pathogenesis and Control - Volume I","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d661a6c76d6cd0cf6e30b7e126a70d565d8a0701.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122338.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007844/; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2014_393","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acid-induced HA protein activation","H5N1 HA activation pH","high HA activation pH","HA proteins of diverse influenza virus subtypes","role of HA acid stability","H3 HA proteins","Low-pH induced HA protein refolding","irreversible HA protein conformational changes","protein-mediated membrane fusion","virus hemagglutinin","virus inactivation","novel determinant of influenza virus biology","acid exposure","pathogenicities of human influenza viruses","pH values","pathogenic avian influenza","acid stabilities of H1","endosomal low pH","emerging viruses","enveloped viruses","target membrane","viral fusion glycoprotein","live attenuated virus vaccines","evolved membrane-fusion mediating glycoproteins","replication rates","efficient replication","avian species","irreversible process","variety of species","prototypic structural class","increased pandemic potential","fusogenic","HPAI","decrease","paradigm","grooves","leash","absence","release energy","cellular membranes","amantadine susceptibilities","proteolytic cleavage","airborne transmission","mammals","contrast","understanding","hairpin structure","Mutations"],"language":"en"},

In the 2014 and 2015 outbreak, more than 28,000 infections were reported by the World Health Organization, with about 11,300 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5), termed also GRP78, is a host cell chaperone protein responsible for the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under stress, HSPA5 is upregulated and becomes cell-surface exposed. Recent studies report the association of cell-surface HSPA5 with EBOV glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. In this study, structural and sequence analysis and molecular docking are used to predict the possible binding site between the cell-surface HSPA5 and EBOV GP1. The results show a promising binding site that supports the hypothesis of HSPA5 selectivity for binding to a specific peptide sequence (pep42). This study paves the way to suggest possible inhibitors to stop viral association with cell-surface receptors and subsequently reduce viral infection.

However, often, the total number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemics is much lower than predicted from the early dynamics. This discrepancy is argued to result from human intervention or nonlinear dynamics not incorporated in standard models. We show that when variability in infection rates is included in standard susciptible-infected-susceptible ([Formula: see text]) and susceptible-infected-recovered ([Formula: see text]) models the total number of infected individuals in the late dynamics can be orders lower than predicted from the early dynamics. This discrepancy holds for [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] models, where the assumption that all individuals have the same sensitivity is eliminated. In contrast with network models, fixed partnerships are not assumed. We derive a moment closure scheme capturing the distribution of sensitivities. We find that the shape of the sensitivity distribution does not affect [Formula: see text] or the number of infected individuals in the early phases of the epidemics. However, a wide distribution of sensitivities reduces the total number of removed individuals in the [Formula: see text] model and the steady-state infected fraction in the [Formula: see text] model. The difference between the early and late dynamics implies that in order to extrapolate the expected effect of the epidemics from the initial phase of the epidemics, the rate of change in the average infectivity should be computed. These results are supported by a comparison of the theoretical model to the Ebola epidemics and by numerical simulation.","publish_time":"2016-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lachiany, Menachem; Louzoun, Yoram","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79b57a630d8f3c584db9245a259dffa6d2f45c8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27627337/; https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.94.022409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Formula","text","total number of infected individuals","observed infected early dynamics","susceptible-infected","late dynamics","Ebola epidemics","nonlinear dynamics","standard models","standard susciptible-infected","total number of removed individuals","early phases","network models","epidemic models","steady-state infected fraction","sensitivity distribution","theoretical model","wide distribution of sensitivities","discrepancy","end","rate of change","infection rates","contrast","fixed partnerships","order","outcome","initial phase","moment closure scheme","expected effect","human intervention","average infectivity","comparison","numerical simulation","difference","assumption","variability","goal","shape","results"],"language":"en"},

Recent trials suggest procalcitonin-based guidelines can reduce antibiotic use for respiratory infections. However, the accuracy of procalcitonin to discriminate between viral and bacterial pneumonia requires further dissection. METHODS. We evaluated the association between serum procalcitonin concentration at hospital admission with pathogens detected in a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Systematic pathogen testing included cultures, serology, urine antigen tests, and molecular detection. Accuracy of procalcitonin to discriminate between viral and bacterial pathogens was calculated. RESULTS. Among 1735 patients, pathogens were identified in 645 (37%), including 169 (10%) with typical bacteria, 67 (4%) with atypical bacteria, and 409 (24%) with viruses only. Median procalcitonin concentration was lower with viral pathogens (0.09 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], \u003C0.05\u20130.54 ng/mL) than atypical bacteria (0.20 ng/mL; IQR, \u003C0.05\u20130.87 ng/mL; P = .05), and typical bacteria (2.5 ng/mL; IQR, 0.29\u201312.2 ng/mL; P \u003C .01). Procalcitonin discriminated bacterial pathogens, including typical and atypical bacteria, from viral pathogens with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], .69\u2013.77). A procalcitonin threshold of 0.1 ng/mL resulted in 80.9% (95% CI, 75.3%\u201385.7%) sensitivity and 51.6% (95% CI, 46.6%\u201356.5%) specificity for identification of any bacterial pathogen. Procalcitonin discriminated between typical bacteria and the combined group of viruses and atypical bacteria with an area under the ROC curve of 0.79 (95% CI, .75\u2013.82). CONCLUSIONS. No procalcitonin threshold perfectly discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens, but higher procalcitonin strongly correlated with increased probability of bacterial pathogens, particularly typical bacteria.","publish_time":"2017-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Self, Wesley H.; Balk, Robert A.; Grijalva, Carlos G.; Williams, Derek J.; Zhu, Yuwei; Anderson, Evan J.; Waterer, Grant W.; Courtney, D.

Cytoskeletal proteins are often involved during viral infections, either for cell entry or the initiation of the immune response. The importance of actin and clathrin dynamics for cell entry and the initiation of the cellular immune response against RSV in human immune cells is not known yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry of RSV and the subsequent effect on T cell activation and interferon gamma release in human immune cells. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes were isolated from healthy adults and stimulated in vitro with RSV. Actin and clathrin dynamics were inhibited with respectively cytochalasin D and chlorpromazine. T cell receptor signaling was inhibited with cyclosporin A. Flow cytometry was used to determine the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry and T cell activation by RSV. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate the contribution of actin and clathrin on the release of interferon gamma. RESULTS: Cell entry, virus gene transcription and interferon gamma release are actin-dependent. Post-endocytic processes like the increased expression of major histocompatibility complex II on monocytes , T cell activation and the release of interferon gamma are clathrin-dependent. Finally, T cell receptor signaling affects T cell activation, whereas soluble interleukin 18 is dispensable. CONCLUSION: Analysis of cell entry and interferon gamma release after infection with RSV reveals the importance of actin- and clathrin-dependent signaling in human immune cells. Insights into the cellular biology of the human immune response against respiratory syncytial virus will provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and may prove useful in the development of preventive strategies.","publish_time":"2016-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jans, Jop; elMoussaoui, Hicham; de Groot, Ronald; de Jonge, Marien I.; Ferwerda, Gerben","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e6c85e4e3409c135ec4d5525290a9908aac2b58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4802911.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0506-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27004689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell entry of RSV","T cell activation","T cell receptor","Analysis of cell entry","interferon gamma release","release of interferon gamma","clathrin-dependent","actin-dependent","human immune cells","clathrin dynamics","role of actin","importance of actin","human immune response","contribution of actin","cellular immune response","Respiratory syncytial virus","initiation","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells","severe respiratory tract infections","virus gene transcription","purified monocytes","cellular biology","viral infections","increased expression of major histocompatibility complex","subsequent effect","better understanding of disease pathogenesis","soluble interleukin","Post-endocytic processes","METHODS","healthy adults","cyclosporin","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","cytochalasin D","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","development of preventive strategies","CONCLUSION","Flow cytometry","Cytoskeletal proteins","chlorpromazine","study","Insights","aim"],"language":"en"},

The results of dwarf chicken embryos, growth kinetics, and viral titration in the embryos demonstrated that the biological characteristics of the recombinant virus remained unchanged. Like the rH120-infected group and in contrast to the rIBYZ-infected group, no mortality, clinical signs, or lesions were observed in the lungs or kidneys of young chickens inoculated with rH120-S1/YZ. The viral loads in various tissues, cloacal, and oral swabs was lower in most types of samples, indicating that the rH120-S1/YZ strain was highly safe in chicks. Compared to rH120 vaccination group, when the efficacy of this strain was evaluated against the QX-like IBV strain, better protection, with 100% survival rate and no disease symptom or gross lesion was observed in the chickens vaccinated with rH120-S1/YZ. Increased levels of IBV-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of the rH120-S1/YZ-vaccinated animals 14 days post-vaccination.

Non-emergency endoscopic activity in the UK has been postponed, raising concerns of increased delays in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and a surge in demand once services resume. Measures to mitigate this risk must be considered. METHOD This paper reviews various investigative modalities for colorectal disease which could be deployed during cessation of colonoscopy services. We focus on colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) due to its relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ability to triage patients effectively to further endoscopic investigations. RESULTS CT of the abdomen and pelvis has been suggested as a triage tool while access to colonoscopy is limited. However, CT may lead to the spread of COVID-19 as patients attend the hospital, and it exposes them to the risks of radiation. Faecal immunochemistry tests have been demonstrated as a good predictor of colonic pathology and could be safely used to risk stratify patients when prioritising colonoscopy. CCE is a safe and innovative technology for investigating the colon. Procedures can be carried out in the community and can be conducted safely during the coronavirus pandemic. It has been shown to be an accurate detector of colonic neoplasia and can reduce demand for colonoscopy. CONCLUSION As colonoscopy services resume, they will likely experience high demand leading to further delays for patients. CCE could be used to reduce the number of patients requiring colonoscopy and triage those requiring further endoscopic investigations appropriately.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacLeod, C; Wilson, P; Watson, Ajm","journal":"Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","CT","CCE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["colonoscopy services resume","cessation of colonoscopy services","number of patients","endoscopic investigations","coronavirus pandemic","high demand","triage tool","colorectal disease","Non-emergency endoscopic activity","spread of COVID","RESULTS CT","diagnosis of colorectal cancer","concerns of increased delays","colon capsule endoscopy","accurate detector of colonic neoplasia","good predictor of colonic pathology","paper reviews various investigative modalities","surge","significant challenges","METHOD","UK","healthcare delivery","pelvis","innovative technology","globe","abdomen","access","relevance","ability","CONCLUSION","Faecal immunochemistry tests","risks of radiation","Measures","hospital","Procedures","community"],"language":"en"},

Consistent with this, some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole\u2010body irradiation (WBI), which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells. To decisively test whether and to what extent WBI in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages, we exposed young male C57BL/6 mice to sublethal WBI (0.5\u20134 Gy), mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe. We followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan, response to vaccination, and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age.

In our efforts to study antiviral responses to influenza in avian hosts, we have noted key genes that appear to be missing. As a result, we speculate that birds have impaired detection of viruses and intracellular pathogens. Birds are missing TLR8, a detector for single-stranded RNA. Chickens also lack RIG-I, the intracellular detector for single-stranded viral RNA. Riplet, an activator for RIG-I, is also missing in chickens. IRF3, the nuclear activator of interferon-beta in the RIG-I pathway is missing in birds. Downstream of interferon (IFN) signaling, some of the antiviral effectors are missing, including ISG15, and ISG54 and ISG56 (IFITs). Birds have only three antibody isotypes and IgD is missing. Ducks, but not chickens, make an unusual truncated IgY antibody that is missing the Fc fragment. Chickens have an expanded family of LILR leukocyte receptor genes, called CHIR genes, with hundreds of members, including several that encode IgY Fc receptors. Intriguingly, LILR homologues appear to be missing in ducks, including these IgY Fc receptors. The truncated IgY in ducks, and the duplicated IgY receptor genes in chickens may both have resulted from selective pressure by a pathogen on IgY FcR interactions. Birds have a minimal MHC, and the TAP transport and presentation of peptides on MHC class I is constrained, limiting function. Perhaps removing some constraint, ducks appear to lack tapasin, a chaperone involved in loading peptides on MHC class I. Finally, the absence of lymphotoxin-alpha and beta may account for the observed lack of lymph nodes in birds. As illustrated by these examples, the picture that emerges is some impairment of immune response to viruses in birds, either a cause or consequence of the host-pathogen arms race and long evolutionary relationship of birds and RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2013-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magor, Katharine E.; Miranzo Navarro, Domingo; Barber, Megan R.W.; Petkau, Kristina; Fleming-Canepa, Ximena; Blyth, Graham A.D.; Blaine, Alysson H.","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8f7838853a28b0618da802dd333f6eeaa1f5fe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172724.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X13001146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624185/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X13001146; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2013.04.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chickens","missing TLR8","Ducks","evolutionary relationship of birds","CHIR genes","key genes","RNA viruses","RIG","MHC class","Fc receptors","single-stranded RNA","smaller repertoire of immune genes","beta","expanded family of LILR leukocyte receptor genes","intracellular detector","minimal MHC","viral RNA","Fc fragment","impaired detection of viruses","nuclear activator of interferon","loading peptides","presentation of peptides","antiviral responses","intracellular pathogens","LILR homologues","antibody isotypes","antiviral effectors","observed lack of lymph nodes","impairment of immune response","host-pathogen arms race","avian hosts","TAP transport","influenza","consequence","ISG15","tapasin","absence of lymphotoxin","chaperone","mammals","cause","ISG54","ISG56","efforts","IRF3","selective pressure","hundreds of members","pathway","FcR interactions","picture","IFITs","IgD","constraint","Riplet","examples","IFN","function","result"],"language":"en"},

Reports of exacerbated immunopathology in conditions of impaired co-inhibition foster the view that downregulation of T cell activity is an essential negative feedback mechanism that protects from excessive pathogen-directed immunity.

However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected AAHKS industry partners and the surgeon-industry relationship, emphasizing education, resource allocation, and strategic direction for the 2nd half of 2020. METHODS: AAHKS industry partners were contacted to participate in a blinded survey and optional interview with the AAHKS Industry Relations Committee. Based on the results, a group of AAHKS member surgeons with disparate practice types were asked to postulate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has and will affect their practice and relationship with Industry. RESULTS: AAHKS industry partner responses indicated decreased resource allocation for regional, \u201Cother national,\u201D and AAHKS annual meetings (67%, 55%, and 30%, respectively). Web-based educational content was expected to increase in 2020 and will likely remain a point of emphasis in 2021 (100% and 70% of responders). For Q3/Q4 2020, a significant emphasis was placed on site of service/outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures (70% and 90% of responders), as well as increased availability of instrumentation and implants (40% and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the orthopedic landscape for the foreseeable future. Survey responses by AAHKS industry partners demonstrate a continued commitment to surgeon education with and increasing shift to a web-based platform. Increased resource allocation for outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures were significant. Articulating optimal mechanisms to aid industry in supporting surgeons with different practice models to meet demand during the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be critical.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warth, Lucian C.; Noiseux, Nicolas O.; Duncan, Stephen T.; Daines, S.

We analyzed 219 camel and human MERS-CoV genome sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 5 and 214 strains belong to clade A and B, respectively, with clade A further divided into lineage A1 (3 human strains) and lineage A2 (2 camel strains), and clade B divided into B1 to B6 (each containing both human and camel strains). Recombination analysis showed potential recombination events in five strains from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia, with recombination between lineage B5 and B3 in four strains, and between lineage B3 and B4 in one strain. The spike protein showed the highest number of amino acid substitutions, especially between A2 and other lineages, and contained positively selected codons. Notably, codon 1020 was positively selected among B and B5 strains, and can distinguish between clade A (Q1020) and B (R1020/H1020) strains, suggesting that this residue may play a role in the evolution of S protein during divergence of different lineages.

The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Yonghong; Torok, Mili Estee","journal":"Lancet Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/faf3ed3d6fc359c1f310e32061e5ed414fee7017.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128408.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309920301523; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30152-3; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920301523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO International Health Regulations."],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["control of COVID","acquisition of COVID","outbreak of COVID","infected patients","disease control","infection prevention","different epidemic prevention measures","implementation of epidemic control measures","widespread use","control advice","value","use of personal protective equipment","N95 masks","treatment of patients","community prevention","surgical masks","ill patients","use of oseltamivir","known infected person","traditional Chinese medicine","health-care workers","use of antiviral drugs","public health education","antibiotics","general population","protective clothing","direct contact","face-to-face contact","communities","Chinese people","High-filtration masks","waste of personal protective equipment","patients drugs of unknown efficacy","brief contact","urgent public health priority","International Health Regulations","roads","known effective treatments","countries","widespread practice of spraying disinfectant","different risk factors","infection onset","lockdown of villages","scientific evidence","individual villages","risk of transmission","large quantities of alcohol","practice of blocking traffic","Misinformation spreads panic","estimated maximum incubation period","prednisone","compliance","glucocorticoids","days of exposure","air disinfection of cities","vaccine","lopinavir","ritonavir","sky","resources","goggles","civil unrest","airborne route","gowns","anxiety","vehicles","actions","hospitals","development","China","distress","personnel","clinical trials","epidemiological findings","objective manner","context","short supply","flights","humans"],"language":"en"},

By using RT-PCR to partially amplify the M gene, CCoV RNA was detected in 30 samples. Sequence analysis of the M protein grouped eight strains with CCoV-I and another 19 with CCoV-II prototypes. To genotype/subtype the CCoV strains and assess the occurrence of single or multiple CCoV infections, RT-PCR of the S gene was performed, and 25/30 CCoV-positive strains amplified with one or two primer pairs. For 17/25 samples, single infections were detected as follows: six CCoV-I, nine CCoV-IIa and two CCoV-IIb. Eight samples were positive for more than one genotype/subtype as follows: seven CCoV-I/IIa and one CCoV-I/IIb. Sequence analysis revealed that the CCoV-I and IIa strains shared high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototypes. The Brazilian strains of CCoV-IIb displayed an aminoacid insertion that was also described in CCoV-IIb-UCD-1 and TGEV strains.

The association between management-related factors and higher BRD occurrence was also estimated. METHODS: Serum samples, collected from cows and youngstock from 103 dairy cattle herds, were analyzed for antibodies against BHV-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and Mycoplasma bovis. A questionnaire was used to collect data concerning herd management factors and reproductive performance, as well as the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease in the last two years, as evaluated by the veterinarian or farm manager. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and quantify the risk factors. RESULTS: A low to moderate prevalence (1-49%) of BRSV antibodies among youngstock was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease (OR = 6.2, p = 0.010) in cows and in-calf heifers. Employees of the farm may participate in the spread of such disease. Larger herd size, loose-housing of cows, housing youngstock separately from cows until pregnancy, and purchasing new animals were factors possibly related to a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in pregnant heifers and cows. The highest risk of abortions (\u003E 1.3%) and increased insemination index (number of inseminations per pregnancy) (\u003E 1.9) occurred in herds with a moderate prevalence of BHV-1 antibodies (1-49%) in cows. CONCLUSIONS: BHV-1 was not associated with acute respiratory disease in adult dairy cattle, however was significantly related to reproductive performance. BRSV possesses the main role in respiratory disease complex in adult dairy cattle.","publish_time":"2012-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raaperi, Kerli; Bougeard, Stephanie; Aleksejev, Annely; Orro, Toomas; Viltrop, Arvo","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09ccb3b9fece55e72c3acb85c4259de62a9c9e0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3298528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22289165/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-54-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCA","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory disease complex","acute respiratory disease","housing of cows","high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms","occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","herd management factors","reproductive performance","BRSV antibodies","management-related factors","risk factors","higher BRD occurrence","adult dairy cattle","dairy cattle herds","moderate prevalence of BHV","housing youngstock","pregnant heifers","bovine herpesvirus","pregnancy","calf heifers","bovine viral diarrhoea virus","Larger herd size","farm manager","logistic regression analysis","Multiple correspondence analysis","highest risk of abortions","MCA","BVDV","main role","number of inseminations","data","increased insemination index","associations","status","Serum samples","new animals","study","veterinarian","RESULTS","years","Mycoplasma bovis","BACKGROUND","aim","METHODS","spread","questionnaire","Employees","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we showed that lipid rafts also play an important role in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV). Cholesterol depletion by pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD) inhibited the production of SARS-CoV particles released from the infected cells. This inhibition was prevented by addition of cholesterol to the culture medium, indicating that the reduction of virus particle release was caused by the loss of cholesterol in the cell membrane. In contrast, cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage (3h post-infection) caused only a limited effect on virus particle release. Northern blot analysis revealed that the levels of viral mRNAs were significantly affected by pretreatment with M\u03B2CD, but not by treatment at 3h post-infection. Interestingly, no apparent evidence for colocalization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with lipid rafts in the membrane of Vero E6 cells was obtained. These results suggest that lipid rafts could contribute to SARS-CoV infection in the early replication process in Vero E6 cells.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Gui-Mei; Li, Yong-Gang; Yamate, Masanobu; Li, Shu-Ming; Ikuta, Kazuyoshi","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77580a5110b575f825e6f1fe1d4d7b4cf8ec9d41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110773.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457906003789; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457906003789","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pretreatment of Vero E6 cells","membrane of Vero E6 cells","SARS-CoV infection","Cholesterol depletion","Abstract Lipid rafts","h post-infection","loss of cholesterol","infected cells","addition of cholesterol","production of SARS","CoV particles","M\u03B2CD","reduction of virus particle release","post-entry stage","cell membrane","life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome","early replication process","methyl-\u03B2","limited effect","important role","colocalization of angiotensin","cyclodextrin","enzyme","levels of viral mRNAs","culture medium","coronavirus","apparent evidence","Northern blot analysis","contrast","inhibition","viruses","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been implicated in neonatal nosocomial respiratory infection. Prior to our study, several cases of neonatal infection were observed in infants born at our hospital. This prospective pilot monocentric pilot study investigates the possibility of maternofetal transmission of HCoV responsible for cases of neonatal infection observed within the first 24 hours of life. Materials and methods Three samples from mother\u2013child couples, maternal vaginal (VM) and respiratory (RM) samples during labor; newborn gastric sample (GNN), were assessed for viral analysis using real time RT-PCR for the detection of HCoV 229-E and OC43. Clinical follow-up of infants and mothers was up to Day 3 after birth. Results One hundred (and) fifty-nine mother\u2013child couples were included between July 2003 and August 2005. HCoV 229-E only was detected in 11 samples from 6 mother\u2013child couples. For 2 couples, all 3 samples (VM, RM and GNN) were tested positive (cases 1 and 2). For case 3, both VM and GNN were positive. For 2 couples, only RM was positive (cases 4 and 5). In case 6, only VM was positive. Of the 3 positive GNN, no infant was symptomatic. Conclusion Possible vertical transmission of HCoV was evidenced in this pilot study and requires further investigation on a larger scale. Equally indicated is the inclusion of tests to detect recently identified human coronaviruses HCoV NL63 and HKU1, as well as genomic profile analysis of HCoV 229-E detected in the 3 positive mother-child couples.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gagneur, A.; Dirson, E.; Audebert, S.; Vallet, S.; Quillien, M.C.L.; Baron, R.; Laurent, Y.; Collet, M.; Sizun, J.; Oger, E.; Payan, C.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c61cf85c5ba46468b0b33dfcc5ecff11026aba9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119136.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811407001198; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811407001198","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["newborn gastric"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV responsible","HCoV d\u00E9tect\u00E9s","positive GNN","\u00C9tude des couples m\u00E8re","GNN positifs","GNN were positive","only VM was positive","only RM was positive","HCoV was evidenced in this pilot study","positive mother","enfant positifs","E detected in the","both VM","E only was detected in","In case","were tested positive","child couples were included between July","cas d\u0027infections n\u00E9onatales","the detection","mothers was","\u00E9tude pilote recherche","were assessed","tests to detect recently identified human coronaviruses HCoV NL63","nouveau","cas infections n\u00E9onatales observ\u00E9es","neonatal infection observed within the first","implicated in neonatal nosocomial respiratory infection","neonatal infection were observed in infants born at our hospital","nine mother","several cases","maternofetal transmission","This prospective pilot monocentric pilot study investigates the possibility","methods Three samples from mother","possible transmission verticale","Prior to our study","no infant was symptomatic","Conclusion Possible vertical transmission","m\u00E9thode \u00C9tude monocentrique prospective pilote","Equally indicated is the inclusion","PCR","to Day","samples during labor","HKU1","\u00E9ventuelle transmission maternof\u0153tale","\u00E9chantillons","recherche des coronavirus humains identifi\u00E9s","\u00E9vidence","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements","seuls","OC43","Abstract Human coronaviruses","as well as genomic","maternal vaginal","survenue d\u0027infections respiratoires nosocomiales","viral analysis using real time RT","requires further investigation","newborn gastric sample","transcription","mise","premi\u00E8res","fifty","existence","polymerase chain reaction","Mat\u00E9riel","Materials","hours","temps r\u00E9el","r\u00E9alisation","after birth","larger scale","August","travail","profil g\u00E9nomique","hundred","heures de vie","Analyse virologique","m\u00E8res","Suivi clinique","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","Clinical follow","large \u00E9chelle","Results","j3","R\u00E9sultats"],"language":"fr"},

Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is employed as an N-terminal tag to increase the yield and solubility of its fusion partners. The MBP moiety is then removed by rhinovirus 3C protease, prior to purification, to yield an N-terminally His(6)-tagged protein. Proteins that are only temporarily rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP are readily identified at this stage because they will precipitate after the MBP tag is removed by 3C protease. The remaining soluble His(6)-tagged protein, if any, is subsequently purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Finally, the N-terminal His(6) tag is removed by His(6)-tagged tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to yield the native recombinant protein, and the His(6)-tagged contaminants are removed by adsorption during a second round of IMAC, leaving only the untagged recombinant protein in the column effluent. The generic strategy described here saves time and effort by removing insoluble aggregates at an early stage in the process while also reducing the tendency of MBP to \u201Cstick\u201D to its fusion partners during affinity purification.","publish_time":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raran-Kurussi, Sreejith; Waugh, David S.","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9d7aa6941c48578e360e0476d82295993c3e9e7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9bddad5b8597afa80f799ae234986958e1628387.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4877217.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4877217?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2016.04.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000326971630029X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105777/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000326971630029X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia"],"organizations":["MBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MBP tag","untagged recombinant protein","native recombinant protein","C protease","tendency of MBP","MBP moiety","yield","affinity purification of recombinant proteins","N-terminal tag","dual protease protocol","fusion partners","Escherichia coli maltose binding protein","immobilized metal affinity chromatography","round of IMAC","early stage","time","insoluble aggregates","rhinovirus","new method","effort","TEV","column effluent","stick","solubility","adsorption","process","tobacco","generic strategy","contaminants"],"language":"en"},

Much of what we know about viral immunity comes from studies using mouse models. Experiments using the Friend virus (FV) model have been particularly informative in defining highly complex anti-retroviral mechanisms of the intrinsic, innate and adaptive arms of immunity. FV studies have unraveled fundamental principles about how the immune system controls both acute and chronic viral infections. They led to a more complete understanding of retroviral immunity that begins with cellular sensing, production of type I interferons, and the induction of intrinsic restriction factors. Novel mechanisms have been revealed, which demonstrate that these earliest responses affect not only virus replication, but also subsequent innate and adaptive immunity. This review on FV immunity not only surveys the complex host responses to a retroviral infection from acute infection to chronicity, but also highlights the many feedback mechanisms that regulate and counter-regulate the various arms of the immune system. In addition, the discovery of molecular mechanisms of immunity in this model have led to therapeutic interventions with implications for HIV cure and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2019-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dittmer, Ulf; Sutter, Kathrin; Kassiotis, George; Zelinskyy, Gennadiy; B\u00E1nki, Zolt\u00E1n; Stoiber, Heribert; Santiago, Mario L; Hasenkrug, Kim J","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1e0bc2758ad1e6f459474544a81ce7e39b8dc51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6735856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087035/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuz012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FV immunity","adaptive immunity","adaptive arms of immunity","retroviral infection","complete understanding of retroviral immunity","discovery of molecular mechanisms of immunity","complex anti-retroviral mechanisms","FV studies","feedback mechanisms","Novel mechanisms","acute infection","endogenous retroviral sequences","immune system controls","complex host responses","virus replication","Friend virus","earliest responses","various arms","chronic viral infections","induction of intrinsic restriction factors","implications","HIV cure","record","cellular sensing","fundamental principles","interferons","therapeutic interventions","evolutionary battle","production of type","vaccine development","counter","chronicity","human genome","mouse models","retroviruses","addition","Experiments","review"],"language":"en"},

Methods Between January 2018 and March 2020, 1027 NCPP and 1140 IP were recruited from Tongji hospital. Blood routine examination, biochemical indicators, and coagulation function analysis were performed in all participants simultaneously. Results There was no sex predominance in NCPP. The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of NCPP (56\u00B116 years) was higher than IP (47\u00B117 years), but without statistical difference. Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant difference, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP. We observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase, and d-dimer, compared with IP. However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with those in IP. The diagnostic model based on combination of eighteen routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777 to 0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and a specificity of 90.09% when using a cutoff value of 0.598.

The replicase is expressed in the form of two polyproteins and is subsequently processed into smaller nonstructural proteins (nsps). nsp9, containing the viral replicase, has characteristic sequence motifs conserved among the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of positive-strand (PS) RNA viruses. To test whether the conserved SDD motif can tolerate other conserved motifs of RNA viruses and the influence of every residue on RdRp catalytic activity, many amino acids substitutions were introduced into it. Only one nsp9 substitution, of serine by glycine (S3050G), could rescue mutant viruses. The rescued virus was genetically stable. Alteration of either aspartate residue was not tolerated, destroyed the polymerase activity, and abolished virus transcription, but did not eliminate virus replication. We also found that the SDD motif was essentially invariant for the signature sequence of PRRSV RdRp. It could not accommodate other conserved motifs found in other RNA viral polymerases, except the GDD motif, which is conserved in all the other PS RNA viruses. These findings indicated that nidoviruses are evolutionarily related to other PS RNA viruses. Our studies support the idea that the two aspartate residues of the SDD motif are critical and essential for PRRSV transcription and represent a sequence variant of the GDD motif in PS RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2011-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yan; Zheng, HaiHong; Gao, Fei; Tian, DeBin; Yuan, ShiShan","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/824707a11a7f1be7be3ff651aaa43dda34ef59b5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-011-4216-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21922433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDD","GDD","PS RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PS RNA viruses","conserved motifs of RNA viruses","RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","RNA viral polymerases","conserved SDD motif","GDD motif","mutant viruses","PRRSV transcription","virus replication","viral replicase","abolished virus transcription","signature sequence of PRRSV RdRp","rescued virus","characteristic sequence motifs","RdRp catalytic activity","sequence variant","respiratory syndrome virus","subgenomic mRNA transcription","genomic replication","polymerase activity","aspartate residues","nsp9 substitution","influence","positive-strand","amino acids substitutions","serine","glycine","S3050G","smaller nonstructural proteins","nsps","idea","polyproteins","form","nidoviruses","Alteration","findings","studies"],"language":"en"},

While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, \u201CMyCoV\u201D, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. The analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package \u2018MyCoV\u2019 which classifies user generated sequences.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilkinson, David A; Joffrin, Lea; Lebarbenchon, Camille; Mavingui, Patrick","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20f2a638e2c9a1917b7c001c371335da3d288505.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d4bbd2413751fdb6e86c5f206aebd5820ecfe52d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.974311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Coronaviruses"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral sequences","subgenus holotype sequences","attribution of subgenus","taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses","available coronavirus sequences","assignment of subgenus","attributing subgenus","user generated sequences","partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses","partial sequence data","specific viral taxa","partial region","plausible method","used partial sequence loci","level taxonomic classifications","specific viral lineages","classification of infecting viral agents","detection","official classifications","designated holotype members","common modern method","MyCoV","defined subgenera","unclassified subgenera","R package","coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","designated holotype reference genomes","official standard","phylogenetic analyses","genetic variation","researchers unsure","Recent updates","recent reclassification","level of certainty","introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories","genome-scale analyses","genetic dissimilarity cut-offs","analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons","biological samples","clade groupings relative","subfamilies","discrete clusters","subfamily Orthocoronavirinae","family Coronaviridae","cited viruses of public health importance","standardisation","major shift","logical threshold boundaries","Riboviria","Distance measures","variations","methods","molecular epidemiology","reliability","type strains","Bayesian phylogenies"],"language":"en"},

Microarrays were first used as a diagnostic tool in 1993, to identify a hantavirus associated with an outbreak of acute respiratory diseases. The main advantage of microarrays is multiplexing, enabling exploration of the microbiota and pathogen detection in bacteremia, respiratory infections, and digestive infections: circumstance in which DNA arrays may lack sensitivity and provide false negatives. Enrichment of sampling can increase sensitivity.

An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with \u03B2-lactam antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic \u03B2-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: In the PRISTINE (Pneumonia treated with RIfampicin aTtenuates INflammation) trial, a randomized, therapeutic controlled, exploratory study in patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, we looked at LTA release and inflammatory and clinical response during treatment with both rifampicin and \u03B2-lactam compared with treatment with \u03B2-lactam antibiotics only. The trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751 (European Clinical Trials Database number 2012-003067-22). RESULTS: Forty-one patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included; 17 of them had pneumococcal pneumonia. LTA release, LTA-mediated inflammatory responses, clinical outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers and transcription profiles were not different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The PRISTINE study demonstrated the feasibility of adding rifampicin to \u03B2-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, but, despite solid in vitro and experimental animal research evidence, failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma LTA concentrations and subsequent inflammatory and clinical responses. Most likely, an inhibitory effect of human plasma contributes to the low immune response in these patients. In addition, LTA plasma concentration could be too low to mount a response via Toll-like receptor 2 in vitro, but may nonetheless have an effect in vivo.","publish_time":"2019-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Groeneveld, Geert H; van der Reyden, Tanny J; Joosten, Simone A; Bootsma, Hester J; Cobbaert, Christa M; de Vries, Jutte J C; Kuijper, Ed J; van Dissel, Jaap T","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c98075a839f10763a8c30207b33c57e4455bc4ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6640306.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkz207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTA","Toll-like"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumococcal pneumonia","LTA release","\u03B2-lactam antibiotics","inflammatory responses","treatment of community","patients","pneumococcal infection","lytic \u03B2-lactam antibiotic treatment","inflammatory biomarkers","plasma LTA concentrations","LTA plasma concentration","clinical responses","treatment groups","low immune response","clinical outcomes","non-lytic rifampicin","PRISTINE study","acute release","European Clinical Trials Database number","inhibitory effect of human plasma","Dutch trial registry","number NTR3751","exploratory study","immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components","transcription profiles","lipoteichoic acid","difference","experimental animal research evidence","INflammation","feasibility","Toll","addition","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","receptor","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs\u2019 confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p \u003C 0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harapan, Harapan; Setiawan, Abdul M.; Yufika, Amanda; Anwar, Samsul; Wahyuni, Sri; Asrizal, Febrivan W.; Sufri, Muhammad R.; Putra, Reza P.; Wijayanti, Nanda P.; Salwiyadi, Salwiyadi; Maulana, Razi; Khusna, Afriyani; Nusrina, Ina; Shidiq, Muhammad; Fitriani, Devi; Muharrir, Muharrir; Husna, Cut A.; Yusri, Fitria; Maulana, Reza; Utomo, Prattama S.; Andalas, Mohd; Wagner, Abram L.; Mudatsir, Mudatsir","journal":"Acta Tropica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f01dfb8b3f82a6ed33c97e4c22309ee8c0ac1b6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111046.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X2030005X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X2030005X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32194068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPX","National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia"],"locations":["Asia","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["HMPX information","HMPX cases","good confidence","confidence interval","GPs\u2019 confidence","confidence score","HMPX case management","case of HMPX outbreak","adjusted analysis","current knowledge","National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia","logistic regression analysis","workplace facilities","medical training","non-endemic countries","adjusted odds ratio","important infectious disease","current re-emergence of human monkeypox","professional characteristics","global concern","general practitioners","exposure","healthcare workers","potential","predictors","majority","skills","frontline doctors","online-based survey","Asia","regions","experience","conclusion","explanatory variables","questionnaire","Indonesian economy","diagnosing","systematic strategy","cut-off","perspectives","addition","study","responses"],"language":"en"},

Experimental evidences were provided for memory maintenance through anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) carrying the internal image of the antigen. In the present work, we describe a structural basis for such memory perpetuation by molecular modeling and structural analysis studies. A three-dimensional model of Ab2 was generated and the structure of the antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein H of Rinderpest virus was modeled using the structural template of hemagglutinin protein of Measles virus. Our results show that a large portion of heavy chain containing the CDR regions of Ab2 resembles the domain of the hemagglutinin housing the epitope regions. The similarity demonstrates that an internal image of the H antigen is formed in Ab2, which provides a structural basis for functional mimicry demonstrated earlier. This work brings out the importance of the structural similarity between a domain of hemagglutinin protein to that of its corresponding Ab2. It provides evidence that Ab2 is indeed capable of functioning as surrogate antigen and provides support to earlier proposed relay hypothesis which has provided a mechanism for the maintenance of immunological memory.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vani, J.; Chatterjee, Jhinuk; Shaila, M.

This was a retrospective study at a tertiary care adult and pediatric teaching hospital. Study patients met a priori criteria for definite or possible nosocomial respiratory viral infection. RESULTS. From April 1, 2015 to April 1, 2016, we identified 40 nosocomial respiratory viral infections in 38 patients involving 14 definite and 3 possible cases in our adult hospital and 18 definite and 5 possible cases in our pediatric hospital. The incidence was 5 cases/10 000 admissions and 44 cases/10 000 admissions to our adult and pediatric hospitals, respectively. Only 6.8% of cases were due to influenza. Although 63% of cases occurred during the fall and winter, such infections were identified throughout the year. Five (13%) nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred in 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients who died during the hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS. Nosocomial respiratory viral infections are an underappreciated cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients.

PDCoV has been experimentally proved to lead to diarrhoea in swine and it was detected positive in pigs in Guangdong, southern China. In our study, 252 faecal and intestinal samples from sucking piglets and sows with diarrhoea were surveyed for common enteric viruses. We found a prevalence of PDCoV (21.8%), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (65.5%), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (0%), rotavirus group A (25.0%) and porcine kobuvirus (68.7%). We isolated 13 PDCoV strains and discovered that PDCoV infections were often co\u2010infections with kobuvirus rather than the commonly linked porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus. Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and N gene revealed that 11 of 13 PDCoV strains belonged to Chinese lineage. As for the left two strains, one single strain (CHN\u2010GD16\u201005) belonged to American and Korean lineages while another strain (CHN\u2010GD16\u201003) was similar to a Thai strain, but only in the S gene.

The aim of this study was to assess whether febrile human rhinovirus (HRV) illness is associated with adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: Active household-based weekly surveillance was performed for respiratory illness episodes in pregnant women as part of a community-based, prospective, randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization in rural Nepal. Rhinovirus (HRV) febrile illness episodes were defined as fever plus cough, sore throat, runny nose, and/or myalgia with HRV detected on mid-nasal swab. Multivariate regression analysis evaluated the association between febrile HRV respiratory illness and adverse birth outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 96 (3%) of 3693 pregnant women had HRV-positive febrile respiratory illnesses. Infants born to pregnant women with HRV febrile illness had a 1.6-fold increased risk of being LBW compared with those with non-HRV febrile illness (28 of 96 [38%] vs 109 of 458 [24%]; relative risk [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1\u20132.3). No difference in risk of LBW was observed between infants born to mothers with non-HRV febrile respiratory illness and those without respiratory illness during pregnancy (109 of 458 [24%] vs 552 of 2220 [25%], respectively; RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8\u20131.2). CONCLUSIONS: Febrile illness due to rhinovirus during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of LBW in a rural South Asian population. Interventions to reduce the burden of febrile respiratory illness due to rhinovirus during pregnancy may have a significant impact on LBW and subsequent infant mortality.","publish_time":"2017-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philpott, Erin K; Englund, Janet A; Katz, Joanne; Tielsch, James; Khatry, Subarna; LeClerq, Stephen C; Shrestha, Laxman; Kuypers, Jane; Magaret, Amalia S; Steinhoff, Mark C; Chu, Helen Y","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12bc05b6a9ae2d8823f67b0a8200fb7f72c45f9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5450902.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofx073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28584855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhinovirus"],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["febrile HRV respiratory illness","non-HRV febrile illness","non-HRV febrile respiratory illness","febrile illness episodes","burden of febrile respiratory illness","respiratory illness episodes","HRV-positive febrile respiratory illnesses","febrile human rhinovirus","pregnancy","increased risk of LBW","Adverse birth outcomes","pregnant women","relative risk","low birth weight","Infants","RR","vs","subsequent infant mortality","rural Nepal","rural South Asian population","association","randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization","cough","weekly surveillance","significant impact","fever","mothers","runny nose","sore throat","myalgia","gestational-age","Active household","Multivariate regression analysis","community","mid-nasal swab","SGA","METHODS","study","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","grams","prematurity","confidence interval","Interventions","difference","aim","infections","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in ARDS assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24-72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0-2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU).

Given these results, planning and public engagement will be needed to encourage the public to be prepared.","publish_time":"2008-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blendon, Robert J.; Koonin, Lisa M.; Benson, John M.; Cetron, Martin S.; Pollard, William E.; Mitchell, Elizabeth W.; Weldon, Kathleen J.; Herrmann, Melissa J.","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/578def3a338542ea59f0251c8f5fa32acc37a83c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eae82da25e8df59f046a3c31405984543b53dc2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2600239.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1405.071437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18439361/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Survey results","community mitigation measures","community mitigation interventions","public engagement","public health officials","national survey","severe outbreak of pandemic influenza","percent of respondents","public\u2019s response","persons","problems","lower incomes","ethnic minorities","job","care","recommendations"],"language":"en"},

We utilized a custom next-generation sequencing approach and allele-specific genotyping assays to detect and validate 280 biallelic variants across all 10 bovine TLR genes, including 71 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one putative nonsense SNP. Bayesian haplotype reconstructions and median joining networks revealed haplotype sharing between Bos taurus taurus and Bos taurus indicus breeds at every locus, and specialized beef and dairy breeds could not be differentiated despite an average polymorphism density of 1 marker/158 bp. Collectively, 160 tagSNPs and two tag insertion-deletion mutations (indels) were sufficient to predict 100% of the variation at 280 variable sites for both Bos subspecies and their hybrids, whereas 118 tagSNPs and 1 tagIndel predictively captured 100% of the variation at 235 variable sites for B. t. taurus. Polyphen and SIFT analyses of amino acid (AA) replacements encoded by bovine TLR SNPs indicated that up to 32% of the AA substitutions were expected to impact protein function. Classical and newly developed tests of diversity provide strong support for balancing selection operating on TLR3 and TLR8, and purifying selection acting on TLR10. An investigation of the persistence and continuity of linkage disequilibrium (r(2)\u22650.50) between adjacent variable sites also supported the presence of selection acting on TLR3 and TLR8. A case-control study employing validated variants from bovine TLR genes recognizing bacterial ligands revealed six SNPs potentially eliciting small effects on susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium spp paratuberculosis infection in dairy cattle. The results of this study will broadly impact domestic cattle research by providing the necessary foundation to explore several avenues of bovine translational genomics, and the potential for marker-assisted vaccination.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisher, Colleen A.; Bhattarai, Eric K.; Osterstock, Jason B.; Dowd, Scot E.; Seabury, Paul M.; Vikram, Meenu; Whitlock, Robert H.; Schukken, Ynte H.; Schnabel, Robert D.; Taylor, Jeremy F.; Womack, James E.; Seabury, Christopher M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6737b541bf9d5d5bbb80cc1dd06456f93dbcda72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3227585.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22164200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B. t."],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bos taurus taurus","bovine TLR SNPs","bovine TLR genes","Bos taurus indicus breeds","adjacent variable sites","Bos subspecies","dairy cattle","dairy breeds","presence of selection","TLR3","TLR8","marker","tagSNPs","variation","avenues of bovine translational genomics","balancing selection operating","validated variants","biallelic variants","immune system","immune responses","AA substitutions","Bayesian haplotype reconstructions","domestic cattle research","case-control study","susceptibility","Mycobacterium avium spp paratuberculosis infection","strong support","median joining networks","locus","key roles","generation sequencing approach","sentries","mammalian","small effects","replacements","bacterial ligands","developed tests of diversity","nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms","allele-specific genotyping assays","provoking host","gene family","detection of invading pathogens","tag insertion-deletion mutations","indels","functioning","receptor","necessary foundation","potential","analyses of amino acid","specialized beef","continuity of linkage disequilibrium","persistence","putative nonsense SNP","Polyphen","average polymorphism density","Toll","hybrids","protein function","investigation","Members","vaccination","tagIndel","results","TLR10"],"language":"en"},

To better understand the cell mediated immune responses to IBV in the mucosal and systemic immune compartments chickens were ocularly vaccinated with IBV. This induced a lymphocyte expansion in head-associated lymphoid tissues (HALT) and to a lesser extent in the spleen, followed by a rapid decline, probably due to homing of lymphocytes out of these organs and contraction of the lymphocyte population. This interpretation was supported by observations that changes in mononuclear cells were mirrored by that in CD3(\u002B)CD44(\u002B) T cell abundance, which presumably represent T effector cells. Increased interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3) expression was observed in the mucosal immune compartment, i.e., HALT, after primary vaccination, but shifted to the systemic immune compartment after boosting. In contrast, the expression of cytotoxicity-associated genes, i.e., granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin mRNA, remained associated with the HALT after boosting.

Method A search was made of the literature for DID and a series of exclusion and structural quality criteria were defined (at least 4 quality criteria: classification according to severity, classification according to level of evidence, bibliographical reference data, description of clinical management, and 11 criteria used for weighting). The level of compliance of every DID with the criteria defined was analysed, together with the level of compliance of each criteria in each DID. Results A total of 54 DID were identified, 30 of which complied with exclusion criteria and 15 of which did not meet the minimum criteria. The rest of the criteria were evaluated in 9 DID: Botplus and Medinteract (100%), SEFH Guide, Lexi-interact and Medscape (89%), Hansten (83%), Micromedex and Stockley (78%), Drug Interactions Facts (68%). Ninety-two percent of the DID describe the mechanism of action, 87% classify the information according to the active ingredient, 75% do not state they have any conflict of interest, classify according to level of severity, have electronic format, and are easy to search. A total of 67% are specific DID, 62% are classified according to level of evidence, contain bibliographical references, and describe clinical management. Conclusions A third of the DID comply with the minimum criteria. Differences were observed in the level and compliance criteria among Spanish and foreign DID.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012, causing severe acute respiratory disease and pneumonia, with 44% mortality among 136 cases to date. Design of vaccines to limit the virus spread or diagnostic tests to track newly emerging strains requires knowledge of antigenic and serologic relationships between MERS-CoV and other CoVs. Methods. Using synthetic genomics and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons (VRPs) expressing spike and nucleocapsid proteins from MERS-CoV and other human and bat CoVs, we characterize the antigenic responses (using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and serologic responses (using neutralization assays) against 2 MERS-CoV isolates in comparison with those of other human and bat CoVs. Results. Serologic and neutralization responses against the spike glycoprotein were primarily strain specific, with a very low level of cross-reactivity within or across subgroups. CoV N proteins within but not across subgroups share cross-reactive epitopes with MERS-CoV isolates. Our findings were validated using a convalescent-phase serum specimen from a patient infected with MERS-CoV (NA 01) and human antiserum against SARS-CoV, human CoV NL63, and human CoV OC43. Conclusions. Vaccine design for emerging CoVs should involve chimeric spike protein containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple virus strains across subgroups to reduce immune pathology, and a diagnostic platform should include a panel of nucleocapsid and spike proteins from phylogenetically distinct CoVs.","publish_time":"2013-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Gopal, Robin; Yount, Boyd L.; Donaldson, Eric F.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Denison, Mark R.; Zambon, Maria; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df0d9d8d2b4b1b8739e29c7fc5cfc4a3c67ce7ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3952667.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit609; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/209/7/995/13804699/jit609.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253287/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV isolates","SARS-CoV","human CoV NL63","human CoV OC43","CoV N proteins","spike proteins","emerging CoVs","bat CoVs","serologic responses","human antiserum","subgroups","distinct CoVs","spike glycoprotein","antigenic responses","neutralization responses","nucleocapsid proteins","multiple virus strains","chimeric spike protein","emerging strains","serologic relationships","neutralizing epitopes","cross-reactive epitopes","knowledge of antigenic","panel of nucleocapsid","diagnostic platform","neutralization assays","diagnostic tests","Vaccine design","Design of vaccines","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons","severe acute respiratory disease","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","VRPs","Western blot","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","synthetic genomics","immune pathology","pneumonia","patient","convalescent-phase serum specimen","low level of cross","reactivity","comparison","mortality","cases","date","findings","Background","Methods","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

In Brazil, this official recommendation lacks an economic evaluation. Our objective was to assess the efficiency of influenza A chemoprophylaxis in the Brazilian context. Methods: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir for prophylaxis of influenza for high risk population, compared to no prophylaxis, in the perspective of Brazilian public health system. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and effectiveness data were based on literature review and costs in Brazilian real (BRL) were estimated from official sources and micro-costing of 2016\u2019s H1N1 admissions at a university hospital. We used a decision-tree model considering prophylaxis and no prophylaxis and the probabilities of H1N1, ambulatory care, admission to hospital, intensive care, patient discharge, and death. Adherence and adverse events from prophylaxis were included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was converted to 2016 United States dollar (USD). Uncertainty was assessed with univariated and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Adherence to prophylaxis was 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54; 0.83]; adverse events, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02; 0.18); relative risk of H1N1 infection in chemoprophylaxis, 0.43 (95% CI 0.33; 0.57); incidence of H1N1, 0.14 (95% CI 0.11; 0.16); ambulatory care, 0.67 (95% CI 0.58; 0.75); hospital admission, 0.43 (CI 95% 0.39; 0.42); hospital mortality, 0.14 (CI 95% 0.12; 0.15); intensive care unit admission, 0.23 (95% CI 0.20; 0.27); and intensive care mortality, 0.40 (95% CI 0.29; 0.52). QALY in H1N1 state was 0.50 (95% CI 0.46; 0.53); in H1N1 inpatients, 0.23 (95% CI 0.18; 0.28); healthy, 0.885 (95% CI 0.879; 0.891); death, 0. Adverse events estimated to affect QALY in \u20130.185 (95% CI \u20130.290; \u20130.050). Cost for chemoprophylaxis was BRL 39.42 [standard deviation (SD) 17.94]; ambulatory care, BRL 12.47 (SD 5.21); hospital admission, BRL 5,727.59 (SD 7,758.28); intensive care admission, BRL 19,217.25 (SD 7,917.33); and adverse events, BRL 292.05 (SD 724.95).

In this study, the role of natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), central players in the innate and adaptive CMI respectively, was examined during natural FIPV infection. When quantified, both NK cells and Tregs were drastically depleted from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node (LN) and spleen in FIP cats. In contrast, mesentery and kidney from FIP cats did not show any difference when compared to healthy non-infected control animals. In addition, other regulatory lymphocytes (CD4\u002BCD25\u2212Foxp3\u002B and CD3\u002BCD8\u002BFoxp3\u002B) were found to be depleted from blood and LN as well. Phenotypic analysis of blood-derived NK cells in FIP cats revealed an upregulation of activation markers (CD16 and CD25) and migration markers (CD11b and CD62L) while LN-derived NK cells showed upregulation of only CD16 and CD62L. LN-derived NK cells from FIPV-infected cats were also significantly less cytotoxic when compared with healthy cats. This study reveals for the first time that FIPV infection is associated with severe suppression of NK cells and Tregs, which is reflected by cell depletion and lowered cell functionality (only NK cells). This will un-doubtfully lead to a reduced capacity of the innate immune system (NK cells) to battle FIPV infection and a decreased capacity (Tregs) to suppress the immunopathology typical for FIP. However, these results will also open possibilities for new therapies targeting specifically NK cells and Tregs to enhance their numbers and/or functionality during FIPV infection.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vermeulen, Ben L.; Devriendt, Bert; Olyslaegers, Dominique A.; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Desmarets, Lowiese M.; Favoreel, Herman W.; Dewerchin, Hannah L.; Nauwynck, Hans J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71c81860b372ec96012faad4ce92170d6ff1ada1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117246.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513000941; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.01.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23434014/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513000941","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","FIP","FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LN-derived NK cells","severe suppression of NK cells","Tregs","FIP cats","FIPV-infected cats","regulatory T cells","natural FIPV infection","healthy cats","CD25","CD16","lowered cell functionality","cell depletion","peripheral blood","CD62L","Foxp3","study","upregulation of activation markers","Phenotypic analysis of blood","migration markers","regulatory lymphocytes","reduced capacity","strong cell-mediated immunity","adaptive CMI","decreased capacity","healthy non-infected control animals","innate immune system","role of natural killer","feline infectious peritonitis virus","central players","new therapies","mesenteric lymph node","protection","CD4","CD11b","spleen","difference","open possibilities","CD3","mesentery","kidney","numbers","results","addition","CD8","contrast","immunopathology typical","time"],"language":"en"},

Codon usage bias analysis can reveal much about the molecular evolution and host adaption of ZIKV. To gain insight into the evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the codon usage pattern in 46 ZIKV strains by calculating the effective number of codons (ENc), codon adaptation index (CAI), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and other indicators. The results indicate that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is relatively low. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that translational selection plays a role in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. The results from a correspondence analysis (CA) indicate that other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity may also be involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Additionally, the results from a comparative analysis of RSCU between ZIKV and its hosts suggest that ZIKV tends to evolve codon usage patterns that are comparable to those of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from Homo sapiens on the ZIKV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Taken together, both natural translational selection and mutation pressure are important for shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of ZIKV and its adaption to its hosts.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hongju; Liu, Siqing; Zhang, Bo; Wei, Wenqiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c182fa44ed42d3f4bce316dc78bec2ea3b6d31ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5125587.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["codon usage pattern of ZIKV","codon usage bias of ZIKV","evolution of ZIKV","ZIKV strains","ZIKV infection","codon usage patterns","ZIKV RSCU patterns","Codon usage bias analysis","host adaption of ZIKV","evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV","relative synonymous codon usage","codon adaptation index","results","hosts","comparative analysis of RSCU","selection pressure","comprehensive analysis","correspondence analysis","natural translational selection","mutation pressure","molecular evolution","Aedes aegypti","Aedes albopictus","Zika virus","CAI","arthralgia","fever","rash","humans","Homo sapiens","role","myalgia","hypothesis","symptoms","effective number of codons","base composition","asthenia","arbovirus","mosquito","family Flaviviridae","aromaticity","hydrophobicity","factors","conjunctivitis","lines of evidence","insight","findings","indicators"],"language":"en"},

Iota-carrageenan has previously shown antiviral effectiveness against cold viruses in clinical trials. This study investigated the efficacy of a carrageenan-containing nasal spray on the duration of the common cold and nasal fluid viral load in adult patients. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 211 patients suffering from early symptoms of the common cold were treated for seven days. Application was performed three times daily with either a carrageenan-supplemented nasal spray or saline solution as placebo with an overall observation period of 21 days. The primary endpoint was the duration of disease defined as the time until the last day with symptoms followed by all other days in the study period without symptoms. During the study, but prior unblinding, the definition of disease duration was adapted from the original protocol that defines disease duration as the time period of symptoms followed by 48 hours without symptoms. RESULTS: In patients showing a laboratory-confirmed cold virus infection and adherence to the protocol, alleviation of symptoms was 2.1 days faster in the carrageenan group in comparison to placebo (p = 0.037). The primary endpoint that had been prespecified but was changed before unblinding was not met. Viral titers in nasal fluids showed a significantly greater decrease in carrageenan patients in the intention-to-treat population (p = 0.024) and in the per protocol population (p = 0.018) between days 1 and 3/4. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with common cold virus infections, direct local administration of carrageenan with nasal sprays reduced the duration of cold symptoms. A significant reduction of viral load in the nasal wash fluids of patients confirmed similar findings from earlier trials in children and adults.

In this study, an easy-to-use strip test to detect receptor binding specificity of influenza virus was developed. A biotinylated anti-hemagglutinin antibody that bound a broad range of group 1 influenza A viruses and latex-conjugated \u03B12,3 (blue) and \u03B12,6 (red) sialylglycopolymers were used in an immunochromatographic strip test, with avidin and lectin immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane at test and control lines, respectively. Accumulation of a sialylglycopolymer\u2013virus\u2013antibody complex at the test line was visualized by eye. The strip test could be completed in 30min and did not require special equipment or skills, thereby avoiding some disadvantages of current methods for analyzing receptor binding specificity of influenza virus.

RECENT FINDINGS: The HIV infection epidemic in China has evolved significantly over the past 35 years, from initially exclusively within people who inject drugs (PWID), to outbreaks due to plasma collection contamination in the mid-1990s, to now almost exclusive transmission via sexual contact. The number of newly-diagnosed cases and the number HIV-related deaths have increased each year since 2004, coinciding with a massive scale-up of both HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy initiation. The proportion of cases diagnosed later in their disease progression has remained constant. SUMMARY: The initial outbreaks of HIV across China were identified quickly and the overall trends have been monitored. While the HIV epidemic among PWID has been well managed, the growing HIV epidemic via sexual contact has grown more complex and even more difficult to control.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Zunyou; Chen, Junfang; Scott, Sarah Robbins; McGoogan, Jennifer M.","journal":"Curr HIV/AIDS Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/084c5a24f64149d229486ee5adec8571773b0973.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088640.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11904-019-00471-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31773405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PWID"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HIV infection epidemic","HIV testing","growing HIV epidemic","initial outbreaks of HIV","China","number HIV-related deaths","sexual contact","PWID","proportion of cases","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","human immunodeficiency virus","history","exclusive transmission","antiretroviral therapy initiation","RECENT FINDINGS","plasma collection contamination","study","people","disease progression","SUMMARY","massive scale","years","drugs","overall trends"],"language":"en"},

The causative pathogen was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (6 bacteria), multiple reverse transcription-PCR (MPCR; 11 viruses), bacterial culture, and serology. The initial chemotherapy was evaluated based on the pathogens identified using PCR. We found 27 viral cases (23.1%), 25 bacterial cases (21.4%), 45 mixed infections with virus and bacteria (38.5%), 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8.5%), 7 mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and another pathogen (6.0%), 1 Chlamydophila pneumoniae (0.9%), and 2 unknown pathogens (1.7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 58 (49.5%) and 27 (23.0%) of the cases, respectively. The median values (50%) of the white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) using the box-and-whisker and plot method, respectively, were 11.7 \u00D7 103 mm\u22123 and 1.4mg/dl in viral infections, 15.6 \u00D7 103 mm\u22123 and 4.8mg/dl in mixed infections with virus and bacteria, 17.8 \u00D7 103 mm\u22123 and 6.3mg/dl in bacterial infections, 6.7 \u00D7 103 mm\u22123 and 1.4mg/dl in M. pneumoniae infections, and 21.5 \u00D7 103 mm\u22123 and 6.4mg/dl in mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and other bacterial infections.

Due to the increasing market demand, various biotechnological approaches have been developed which use Escherichia coli as a microbial catalyst for the stereospecific glycosylation of flavonoids. Despite these efforts, most processes still display low production rates and titers, which render them unsuitable for large-scale applications. RESULTS: In this contribution, we expanded a previously developed in vivo glucosylation platform in E. coli W, into an efficient system for selective galactosylation and rhamnosylation. The rational of the novel metabolic engineering strategy constitutes of the introduction of an alternative sucrose metabolism in the form of a sucrose phosphorylase, which cleaves sucrose into fructose and glucose 1-phosphate as precursor for UDP-glucose. To preserve these intermediates for glycosylation purposes, metabolization reactions were knocked-out. Due to the pivotal role of UDP-glucose, overexpression of the interconverting enzymes galE and MUM4 ensured the formation of both UDP-galactose and UDP-rhamnose, respectively. By additionally supplying exogenously fed quercetin and overexpressing a flavonol galactosyltransferase (F3GT) or a rhamnosyltransferase (RhaGT), 0.94 g/L hyperoside (quercetin 3-O-galactoside) and 1.12 g/L quercitrin (quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside) could be produced, respectively. In addition, both strains showed activity towards other promising dietary flavonols like kaempferol, fisetin, morin and myricetin. CONCLUSIONS: Two E. coli W mutants were engineered that could effectively produce the bio-active flavonol glycosides hyperoside and quercitrin starting from the cheap substrates sucrose and quercetin. This novel fermentation-based glycosylation strategy will allow the economically viable production of various glycosides.

Most available routine tests are agent dependent\u2014that is, they are designed to detect a specific virus and will give a negative test result even if other viruses are present in the sample. For this reason, agent-independent tests such as virus isolation and electron microscopy are still used to identify the unexpected or unknown agent in a clinical sample. Traditional methods such as virus isolation are still widely used; however, many are too slow to have any direct influence on the clinical management of an index case. For some economically important viruses, standardized diagnostic tests and reagents of good quality are available commercially; assays have been miniaturized to conserve reagents and decrease costs; instruments have been developed to automate tests, again often decreasing costs; and computerized analyses aid in making the interpretation of results as objective as possible in addition to facilitating reporting, record keeping, and billing. Respiratory diseases, diarrheal diseases of neonates, and some mucocutaneous diseases may be caused by a variety of different infectious agents, including viruses.

Using a wholly recombinant system, we have investigated the ability of each virus receptor-binding protein, spike or S protein, to bind to ACE-2 in solution and on the cell surface. In both assays, we find that the NL63 S protein has a weaker interaction with ACE-2 than the SARS-CoV S protein, particularly in solution binding, but the residues required for contact are similar. We also confirm that the ACE-2-binding site of NL63 S lies between residues 190 and 739.

Thirty multiparous beef suckler, spring-calving cows, consisting of two genotypes were involved; Limousin\u00D7Friesian (LF) and Charolais\u00D7Limousin (CL). Cows were immunised against the inactivated antigen strain of BoHV-1 (gE- (IBR marker vaccine) at day \u221284 and received a booster at day \u221256 relative to the expected calving date (d 0). Calves were immunised at 14 and 42days of age against PI-3 virus, BRSV and Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica serotype A1 using a commercial vaccine administered subcutaneously. Additionally, calves were immunised against BoHV-1 at 42days of age, using 1 dose of a live commercial vaccine administered intranasally. Blood samples were collected from all calves (n=30) via jugular venipuncture at birth, prior to colostrum feeding (0h), at 12h (h), 24h, 72h and 168h after the initial feeding of colostrum, and at d 7, 14, 28, 42, 56 and 84 post birth.

A close homologue of DC\u2010SIGNR, dendritic\u2010cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3\u2010grabbing non\u2010integrin, has been shown to act as a recycling endocytic receptor, which binds pathogens at the cell\u0027s surface and then releases them in the low pH environment of endosomal compartments. However, it is currently under debate in the literature as to whether DC\u2010SIGNR plays a similar role. In this work, we used NMR to explore whether the DC\u2010SIGNR carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) shows any pH dependence in its ability to bind carbohydrates and Ca(2\u002B). We found clear evidence of reduced or abolished CRD\u2010binding affinities for three different glycans at low pH (4.2) as compared to neutral pH (6.8). We also report the assignment of the DC\u2010SIGNR CRD in the apo form, and use these new results to characterize the degree of structural rearrangement upon binding (or release) of Ca(2\u002B). Finally, we report a differential effect of pH on the affinities of glycans containing mannose exclusively versus glycans containing GlcNAc moieties. Our results lead us to propose that the DC\u2010SIGNR CRD rapidly and reversibly releases glycan ligands and Ca(2\u002B) at reduced pH (behaviour that would be expected for an endocytic receptor), and that the binding of mannose\u2010containing oligosaccharides is more strongly affected by pH than the binding of GlcNAc\u2010containing oligosaccharides.","publish_time":"2014-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Probert, Fay; Mitchell, Daniel A.; Dixon, Ann M.","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40250d16b20b4fcc996834249a3744961b0a74b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164107.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24976257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIGNR CRD","reduced pH","pH dependence","neutral pH","physiological role of DC","non\u2010integrin","binding affinities","close homologue of DC","binding of mannose","binding of GlcNAc","differential effect of pH","cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule","abolished CRD","affinities of glycans","SIGNR carbohydrate recognition domain","low pH environment of endosomal compartments","Dendritic cell","different glycans","oligosaccharides","recycling endocytic receptor","similar role","GlcNAc moieties","new results","clear evidence of reduced","lymph node","pathogens","liver","apo form","degree of structural rearrangement","HIV","CLEC4M","CD209L","release","ability","healthy cells","glycan ligands","viruses","CD299","carbohydrates","literature","assignment","infection rates","cell\u0027s surface","NMR","behaviour","dependent lectin","work","debate","certainty"],"language":"en"},

It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2\u20134% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viner, Russell M; Russell, Simon J; Croker, Helen; Packer, Jessica; Ward, Joseph; Stansfield, Claire; Mytton, Oliver; Bonell, Chris; Booy, Robert","journal":"The Lancet.

For other viruses like human rhinoviruses (HRVs) this is less well established. Viral or bacterial co-infections are often considered essential for severe manifestations of these virus infections. OBJECTIVE: The study aims at identifying viruses that may cause SARI in children in the absence of viral and bacterial co-infections, at identifying disease characteristics associated with these single virus infections, and at identifying a possible correlation between viral loads and disease severities. STUDY DESIGN: Between April 2007 and March 2012, we identified children (\u003C18 year) with or without a medical history, admitted to our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with SARI or to the medium care (MC) with an acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) (controls). Data were extracted from the clinical and laboratory databases of our tertiary care paediatric hospital. Patient specimens were tested for fifteen respiratory viruses with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays and we selected patients with a single virus infection only. Typical bacterial co-infections were considered unlikely to have contributed to the PICU or MC admission based on C-reactive protein-levels or bacteriological test results if performed. RESULTS: We identified 44 patients admitted to PICU with SARI and 40 patients admitted to MC with ARTI. Twelve viruses were associated with SARI, ten of which were also associated with ARTI in the absence of typical bacterial and viral co-infections, with RSV and HRV being the most frequent causes. Viral loads were not different between PICU-SARI patients and MC-ARTI patients. CONCLUSION: Both SARI and ARTI may be caused by single viral pathogens in previously healthy children as well as in children with a medical history. No relationship between viral load and disease severity was identified.","publish_time":"2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moesker, Fleur M.; van Kampen, Jeroen J. A.; van Rossum, Annemarie M.

Herein, we inoculated dogs with Leishmania braziliensis antigens plus saponin (the LBSap vaccine), as well as with the vaccine components, and then used real-time PCR to evaluate the kinetics of dermal expression of mRNAs of cytokines (IL-12, IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1, IL-4, IL-13, TGF-\u03B2 and IL-10) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL21 and CXCL8) 1, 12, 24 and 48h after inoculation. We also evaluated the correlation between cytokine and chemokine expression and dermal cellularity. The LBSap vaccine induced high levels of IL-12 and IL-10 expression at 12 and 24h, respectively. Furthermore, we observed positive correlations between IL-12 and IL-13 expression, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-13 expression, and IL-13 and TGF-\u03B2 expression, suggesting that a mixed cytokine microenvironment developed after immunization with the vaccine. Inoculation with the saponin adjuvant alone induced a chemokine and cytokine expression profile similar to that observed in the LBSap group. CCL4 and CXCL8 chemokine expression was up regulated by the LBSap vaccine. CCL5 expression was initially highest in the LBSap group, but at 48h, expression was highest in the LB group. Information about the kinetics of the immune response to this vaccine gained using this dog model will help to elucidate the mechanisms of and factors involved in a protective response against Leishmania infection and will aid in establishing rational approaches for the development of vaccines against canine visceral leishmaniasis.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vitoriano-Souza, Juliana; Moreira, N\u00E1dia das Dores; Menezes-Souza, Daniel; Roatt, Bruno Mendes; de Oliveira Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian; Siqueira-Mathias, Fernando Augusto; de Oliveira Cardoso, Jamille Mirelle; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro; de S\u00E1, Renata Guerra; Corr\u00EAa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Carneiro, Cl\u00E1udia Martins; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3c2b6ed518ecf24eee08022fadcff0a0738f76e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911411/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.05.231; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589013003994; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589013003994","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCL5 expression","CXCL8 chemokine expression","LBSap vaccine","TGF-\u03B2 expression","cytokine expression profile similar","kinetics of dermal expression of mRNAs","high levels of IL","LBSap group","vaccine components","chemokine expression drives activation of immune effector cells","chemokines","cytokines","mixed cytokine microenvironment","IFN-\u03B3","CCL4","Leishmania infection","inoculation","adaptive immune responses","saponin adjuvant","dermal cellularity","protective response","infection sites","Leishmania braziliensis antigens","development of vaccines","pathogens","recruitment","TNF-\u03B1","canine visceral leishmaniasis","dogs","real-time PCR","CCL21","immunization","rational approaches","complex interplay","factors","dog model","positive correlations","mechanisms","Information"],"language":"en"},

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). Interpretation Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years who were treated in our hospital from January 28, 2020 to March 5, 2020, and explored the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients with COVID-19 (46 common COVID-19, 73 severe COVID-19, and 22 extremely severe COVID-19) were enrolled in the study.

A total of 72 water samples collected from the study area were analysed and their results show that the pH average value ranges from 6.2 in the dry to 8.5 in the rainy seasons for surface water, 6.6 and 8.3 for shallow well water and 6.5 to 8.4 for borehole water. The turbidity in surface water varies from 8.1 to 26.2 Formazin Attenuation Unit (FAU), 0.3 to 2.9 FAU in shallow well water and 0.4 to 4.8 FAU in borehole water. Electrical conductivity (EC) value varies from 1010 to 1840 \u03BCs/cm for surface water, 201 to 950 \u03BCs/cm for shallow well water and 670 to 1650 \u03BCs/cm for borehole water. Total dissolved solids range from 0.1 to 2.6 mg/l in surface water, 0.2 to 4.1 mg/l in shallow well water and 0.3 to 4.4 mg/l in borehole water. The value of the total hardness ranges from 44 to 120 mg in surface water, 46 to 96 mg in shallow well water and 70 to 130 mg in borehole water. The nitrate value ranges from 1.1 to 10.6 mg in surface water, 3.0 to 8.4 mg in shallow well water and 3.7 to 9.6 mg in borehole water. The value of sulphate content varies from 4.6 to 38.5 mg in surface water, 6.2 to 34.8 mg in shallow well water and 5.7 to 55.7 mg in borehole water. The value of phosphate concentrations in surface water varies from 1.0 to 9.0 mg, 0.7 to 3.4 mg in shallow well water and 1.0 to 4.7 mg in borehole water. The bacteriological analysis using the membrane filtration technique revealed the presence of faecal bacteria and total coliform counts. The presence of the analysed twin contaminants in the studied water resources reduced their water quality. The physicochemical and bacteriological data were subjected to statistical and correlation tests. It was concluded that their concentration levels were independent of intra-seasonal changes. The likely natural and artificial sources of contaminants are run-offs from fertilized lands, septic tanks, industrial discharges, sewage and waste disposal, algae blooms and erosion from natural deposits. The inherent risk is water-related diseases such as waterborne diseases, water-washed diseases, water-based diseases and diseases transmitted by water-related insect vectors.

RESULTS: A total of 1666 adult travelers participated in the study, and 69.7% were men. The mean age of the participants was 39 years. Previous travel to tropical countries was reported by 69% of the participants. The most frequent destination was the Indian subcontinent (45.0%). The main reasons for travel were visiting friends and relatives (VFRs; 36.5%) and business (32.4%). Most of the participants traveled for \u003C1 month (51.4%). Only 24.5% pursued pre-travel consultations. Vaccinations were administered to 14.4% of the participants, and of those, 77%, 73%, and 32.5% received hepatitis A, tetanus/diphtheria, and typhoid vaccines, respectively. Malaria prophylaxis was given to 12.2% of the participants. Logistic regression analysis revealed that being male and unemployed, having an elementary level of education, traveling to visiting friends and relatives, and short durations of travel were significant determinants of not seeking pre-travel consultations. CONCLUSION: Significant gaps were revealed in the vaccinations and malaria prophylaxes of travelers departing to Asia. Specific educational tools should be developed to improve the awareness of travelers to high-risk destinations.","publish_time":"2014-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pavli, Androula; Silvestros, Chrysovalantis; Patrinos, Stavros; Maltezou, Helena C.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7506d0383d12f2d54feef66e28441cdb5bc8fc5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102727.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2014.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129447/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034114001026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034114001026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["participants","International travel","Previous travel","pre-travel consultations","pre-travel health","short durations of travel","practices of travelers","adult travelers","awareness of travelers","malaria prophylaxes of travelers","friends","relatives","Vaccinations","significant determinants","Significant gaps","tropical countries","high-risk destinations","Asian destinations","Malaria prophylaxis","questionnaire-based survey","Athens International Airport","tetanus","diphtheria","Logistic regression analysis","elementary level of education","frequent destination","Indian subcontinent","typhoid vaccines","METHODS","study","total","VFRs","main reasons","greatest increases","subtropical areas","mean age","Specific educational tools","hepatitis","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","years","BACKGROUND","business","aim","month"],"language":"en"},

However, early detection of viral infection is also very important for hospital infection control and timely use of antiviral agents. The present study aimed to compare patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia, and identify independent predictors of viral pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1\u2010year period. Older patients (aged \u226565 years) were recruited if they were admitted for CAP confirmed by chest radiographs. RESULTS: A cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. Infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. Bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. Bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) viral culture. The commonest bacterial isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (31), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Klebsiella spp. (9) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6). Influenza A virus (28, 8 were pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 subtype) and respiratory syncytial virus (16) were the most frequent viral causes. Independent predictors of viral pneumonia included nursing home residence (RR 3.056, P = 0.009) and absence of leukocytosis (RR 0.425, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: All nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP should undergo NPA viral testing because of infection control, early antiviral treatment and discharge planning. We suggest that empirical antiviral agents might be considered for nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP if outbreaks of influenza\u2010like illness are reported in nursing homes.

An estimated 71.8 % of zoonotic EID events are caused by pathogens in wildlife and the incidence of such diseases is increasing significantly in humans. In addition, human diseases are starting to infect wildlife, especially non-human primates. The chimpanzee is an endangered species that is threatened by human activity such as deforestation, poaching, and human disease transmission. Recently, several respiratory disease outbreaks that are suspected of having been transmitted by humans have been reported in wild chimpanzees. Therefore, we need to study zoonotic pathogens that can threaten captive chimpanzees in primate research institutes. Serological surveillance is one of several methods used to reveal infection history. We examined serum from 14 captive chimpanzees in Japanese primate research institutes for antibodies against 62 human pathogens and 1 chimpanzee-borne infectious disease. Antibodies tested positive against 29 pathogens at high or low prevalence in the chimpanzees. These results suggest that the proportions of human-borne infections may reflect the chimpanzee\u2019s history, management system in the institute, or regional epidemics. Furthermore, captive chimpanzees are highly susceptible to human pathogens, and their induced antibodies reveal not only their history of infection, but also the possibility of protection against human pathogens.

This study aimed to analyze the complete genome sequence, i.e., 11 genome segments of the lapine rotavirus (LRV) identified in the intestine of a dead rabbit in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and to describe the genetic relationships between this lapine isolate [RVA/Rabbit-wt/KOR/Rab1404/2014/G3P[22] (Rab1404)] and other lapine isolates/strains. Rab1404 possessed the following genotype constellation: G3-P[22]-I2-R3-C3-M3-A9-N2-T3-E3-H3. The P[22] genotype was found to originate from rabbits and was for the first time identified in the ROK. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Rab1404 possessed VP1-3 and VP7 genes, which were closely related to those of the bat strain LZHP2; NSP1-4 genes, which were closely related to those of the simian strain RRV; and VP4, VP6, and NSP5 genes, which were closely related to the genes obtained from other rabbits. Interestingly, a close relationship between Rab1404 and simian RVA strain RVA/Simian-tc/USA/RRV/1975/G3P[3] for 8 gene segments was observed. RRV is believed to be a reassortant between bovine-like RVA strain and canine/feline RVA strains. Rab1404 and canine/feline RVAs shared the genes encoding VP1, VP3, VP7, NSP3, and NSP4. Additionally, the genome segments VP6 (I2), NSP1 (N2), and NSP5 (H3) of Rab1404 were closely related to those of bovine RVAs. This is the first report describing the complete genome sequence of an LRV detected in the ROK. These results indicate that Rab1404 could be a result of interspecies transmission, possibly through multiple reassortment events in the strains of various animal species and the subsequent transmission of the virus to a rabbit.

Levels of secreted TNF-\u03B1 increased 6-fold after stimulation with LPS for 24 h, while secreted IL-6 increased over 9-fold. These results support the hypothesis that retinal glia may participate in intraretinal immune processes following stimulation during inflammatory and infectious processes via either cell surface- or soluble mediator-dependent mechanisms or a combination of both.","publish_time":"1996-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drescher, Kristen M.; Whittum-Hudson, Judith A.","journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/406a1e3d5a2a2e995ed5a845edbfde515445dd0a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165572895001565; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165572895001565","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","CMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exposure","increased ICAM","Surface expression of ICAM","express low levels of MHC Class","increased secreted levels","rIFN-\u03B3","Levels of secreted TNF-\u03B1","LPS","primary cells","passaged cells","rIFN-y","fold","Abstract Murine retinal glia","cultured retinal glial cells","baseline levels","rTNF-\u03B1","secreted IL","surface molecules","normal culture conditions","stimulation","cell surface","culture supernatants","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","intraretinal immune processes","infectious processes","immune function","intense staining","rlFN-y","time-dependent manner","soluble mediator-dependent mechanisms","CMS","dose","astrocytes","antigens","known stimulator of central nervous system","major histocompatibility complex","recombinant Interferon\u03B3","intercellular adhesion molecule","intracellular interleukin","cytokines","avidin-biotin","peroxidase immunohistochemistry","combination","results","hypothesis","Bacterial lipopolysaccharide","incubation","rIL"],"language":"en"},

A case control study was conducted to investigate the potential role of breastfeeding in protecting children \u003C1 year of age from VRI. Methods: Patients admitted for a respiratory tract infections routinely underwent a nasopharyngeal aspirate, which was tested with an RT-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses. Hospitalized infants positive for viruses were enrolled as cases; healthy controls were enrolled among patients admitted for ultrasound hip screening. The effect of breastfeeding on pertussis was investigated through multivariable analysis. Results: We enrolled a total of 496 patients: 238 cases and 258 healthy controls. Among cases, eighty-six patients (36.1%) had a rinovirus, 78 (32.8%) an RSV, 22 (9.2%) an adenovirus, and 37 (15.5%) a coinfections with multiple viruses. The number of households was significantly higher in cases (mean in cases 4.5; mean 3.7 in controls, p \u003C 0.001) and the proportion of infants having siblings (79% in cases vs. 43% in controls, p \u003C 0.001). Proportion of smoking mothers was higher in cases than in controls (21.4 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Among cases 44.5% were exclusively breastfed at symptoms onset vs. 48.8% of healthy controls. According to the multivariable analysis, being exclusively breastfed at symptom onset was associated with a higher risk of viral respiratory infection (3.7; 95% CI 1.64\u20138.41), however a longer breastfeeding duration was protective (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97\u20130.99). Also having at least one sibling was associated to a higher risk (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.14\u20135.92) as well as having a smoking mother (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.33\u20134.89). Conclusions: Breastfeeding remains a mainstay of prevention for numerous diseases and its protective role increases with duration. However, being breastfed when mothers carry a respiratory infection may increase the risk of transmission, acting as a proxy for closer contacts. In future studies, potential confounding variables as pattern of contacts with other individuals, should be taken into account.","publish_time":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pandolfi, Elisabetta; Gesualdo, Francesco; Rizzo, Caterina; Carloni, Emanuela; Villani, Alberto; Concato, Carlo; Linardos, Giulia; Russo, Luisa; Ferretti, Beatrice; Campagna, Ilaria; Tozzi, Alberto","journal":"Front Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d44b78805f7baf17f811f8e5957c546c020abbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6492465.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VRI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","healthy controls","respiratory viruses","CI","higher risk of viral respiratory infection","breastfeeding duration","Viral respiratory tract infections","potential role of breastfeeding","eighty-six patients","effect of breastfeeding","VRI","protective role","risk of transmission","multiple viruses","Proportion of smoking mothers","proportion of infants","multivariable analysis","children younger","pattern of contacts","closer contacts","symptom onset","symptoms onset","potential confounding variables","Hospitalized infants positive","major reason","hospitalization","numerous diseases","mainstay of prevention","future studies","pertussis","Background","year of age","nasopharyngeal aspirate","proxy","individuals","years","ultrasound hip screening","RT-PCR","total","siblings","number of households","case control study","coinfections","Conclusions","Methods","account","Results","rinovirus","RSV","adenovirus"],"language":"en"},

Although the manifestations of coronavirus infection (i.e., rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, nasal obstruction, and bronchitis) are generally self-limiting in healthy adults, certain strains such as HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection and febrile seizure, especially in infants, people of advanced age, and immunocompromised hosts. In 2003, a novel HCoV strain was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that began in Asia in 2002. The strain has hence been referred to as SARS-CoV. In addition, as recently as September 2012, another novel HCoV, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012, was identified as being the cause of fever, renal failure, pneumonia, and severe respiratory distress in two patients in the Middle East. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed highly conserved sequences of ORF1ab, spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope protein genes, but not membrane protein genes, between human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012 and SARS-CoV.

We present inequalities in intervention coverage by two common measures of wealth quintiles and rural or urban status. Case studies of reduction in mortality in Thailand and Indonesia indicate the varying extents of success and point to some factors that accelerate progress. We developed a Lives Saved Tool analysis for the region and for country subgroups to estimate deaths averted by cause and intervention. We identified three major patterns of maternal and child mortality reduction: early, rapid downward trends (Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand); initially high declines (sustained by Vietnam but faltering in the Philippines and Indonesia); and high initial rates with a downward trend (Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar). Economic development seems to provide an important context that should be coupled with broader health-system interventions.

Cancer patients are already known to be very fragile and COVID-19 brings about the risk of severe respiratory complications. In order to treat patients safely while protecting medical teams, the entire health care system must optimize the way it approaches prevention and treatment at a time when social distancing is key to stemming this pandemic. All indications and treatment modalities must be re-discussed. This is particularly the case for radiotherapy of bone metastases for which it is possible to reduce the number of sessions, the frequency of transport and the complexity of treatments. These changes will have to be discussed according to the organization of each radiotherapy department and the health situation, while medical teams must remain vigilant about the risks of complications of bone metastases, particularly spinal metastases. In this short piece, the members of the GEMO (the European Study Group of Bone Metastases) offer a number of recommendations to achieve the above objectives, both in general and in relation to five of the most common situations on radiation therapy for bone metastases.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thureau, S\u00E9bastien; Faivre, Jean Christophe; Assaker, Richard; Biver, Emmanuel; Confavreux, Cyrille B.; Debiais, Fran\u00E7oise; Duterque-Coquillaud, Martine; Giammarile, Fransesco; Heymann, Dominique; Lecouvet, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric E.; Morardet, Laetitia; Paycha, Frederic; Body, Jean-Jacques; Vieillard, Marie-H\u00E9l\u00E8ne","journal":"J Bone Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bd7e284947a9087c99d7c38668786acb255a438.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292693/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212137420300464?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212137420300464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbo.2020.100291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Study Group of Bone Metastases"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["radiotherapy of bone metastases","spinal metastases","European Study Group of Bone Metastases","medical teams","health situation","treatment modalities","oncology treatment","COVID","radiotherapy department","current health crisis","entire health care system","risks of complications","number of sessions","number of recommendations","Cancer patients","risk of severe respiratory complications","GEMO","time","common situations","way","radiation therapy","social distancing","members","frequency of transport","indications","prevention","challenge","case","complexity of treatments","short piece","objectives","relation","pandemic","organization","order","changes"],"language":"en"},

Infections by human-pathogenic coronaviruses result in diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia with extrapulmonary manifestations. Understanding how cellular lipids may modulate the pathogenicity of human-pathogenic coronaviruses remains poor. To this end, we utilized the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model coronavirus to comprehensively characterize the host cell lipid response upon coronavirus infection with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC\u2013MS)-based lipidomics approach. Our results revealed that glycerophospholipids and fatty acids (FAs) were significantly elevated in the HCoV-229E-infected cells and the linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism axis was markedly perturbed upon HCoV-229E infection. Interestingly, exogenous supplement of LA or AA in HCoV-229E-infected cells significantly suppressed HCoV-229E virus replication. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of LA and AA on virus replication was also conserved for the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Taken together, our study demonstrated that host lipid metabolic remodeling was significantly associated with human-pathogenic coronavirus propagation. Our data further suggested that lipid metabolism regulation would be a common and druggable target for coronavirus infections.","publish_time":"2019-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Bingpeng; Chu, Hin; Yang, Dong; Sze, Kong-Hung; Lai, Pok-Man; Yuan, Shuofeng; Shuai, Huiping; Wang, Yixin; Kao, Richard Yi-Tsun; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6aea0cd2aa64321c5528944e105c69a167350dbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6357182.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654597/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010073","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["human coronavirus","coronavirus infections","E infection","human-pathogenic coronavirus propagation","E virus replication","model coronavirus","human-pathogenic coronaviruses","E-infected cells","suppressed HCoV","AA","pathogenicity of human","pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lipid metabolism regulation","cellular lipids","host cell lipid response","host lipid metabolic remodeling","inhibitory effect of LA","exogenous supplement of LA","replication cycle of viruses","arachidonic acid","linoleic acid","metabolism axis","numerous indispensable cellular functions","ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry","UPLC","symptoms","self-limiting flu","diverse clinical outcomes","severe pneumonia","multiple steps","MERS-CoV","druggable target","glycerophospholipids","fatty acids","extrapulmonary manifestations","study","based lipidomics approach","results","FAs","data","end"],"language":"en"},

As intermediate traits, protein biomarkers report on underlying disease severity and prognosis in NSTE-ACS. We hypothesized that integration of dense microRNA (miRNA) profiling with biomarker measurements would highlight potential regulatory pathways that underlie the relationships between prognostic biomarkers, miRNAs, and cardiovascular phenotypes. We performed miRNA sequencing using whole blood from 186 patients from the TRILOGY-ACS trial. Seven circulating prognostic biomarkers were measured: NH(2)-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, osteopontin (OPN), myeloperoxidase, growth differentiation factor 15, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and neopterin. We tested miRNAs for association with each biomarker with generalized linear models and controlled the false discovery rate at 0.05. Ten miRNAs, including known cardiac-related miRNAs 25-3p and 423-3p, were associated with NT-proBNP levels (min. P = 7.5 \u00D7 10(\u22124)) and 48 miRNAs, including cardiac-related miRNAs 378a-3p, 20b-5p and 320a, -b, and -d, were associated with OPN levels (min. P = 1.6 \u00D7 10(\u22126)). NT-proBNP and OPN were also associated with time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in the sample. By integrating large-scale miRNA profiling with circulating biomarkers as intermediate traits, we identified associations of known cardiac-related and novel miRNAs with two prognostic biomarkers and identified potential genomic networks regulating these biomarkers. These results, highlighting plausible biological pathways connecting miRNAs with biomarkers and outcomes, may inform future studies seeking to delineate genomic pathways underlying NSTE-ACS outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwee, Lydia Coulter; Neely, Megan L.; Grass, Elizabeth; Gregory, Simon G.; Roe, Matthew T.; Ohman, E.

The umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus with an unusually long 3\u2032 UTR that is susceptible to NMD. To establish a systemic infection, the PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26 was previously shown to both stabilize viral RNAs and bind them for transport through the plant\u2019s vascular system. The current study demonstrated that p26 protects both viral and nonviral messenger RNAs from NMD. Although p26 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, p26 exerts its anti-NMD effects exclusively in the cytoplasm independently of long-distance movement. Using a transcriptome-wide approach in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, p26 protected a subset of cellular NMD target transcripts, particularly those containing long, structured, GC-rich 3\u2032 UTRs. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the NMD pathway is highly dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection, with 1,820 (48%) of NMD targets increasing in abundance. Widespread changes in the host transcriptome are common during plant RNA virus infections, and these results suggest that, in at least some instances, virus-mediated NMD inhibition may be a major contributing factor.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"May, Jared P.; Johnson, Philip Z.; Ilyas, Muhammad; Gao, Feng; Simon, Anne E.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b33ef28b51b713f949a2414d6a98c6e6e0a3c7f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7064760.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NMD pathway","NMD targets","virus-mediated NMD inhibition","anti-NMD effects","plant RNA virus infections","PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26","RNA viruses","RNA-seq","PEMV2 infection","positive-sense RNA virus","subset of cellular NMD target transcripts","host transcriptome","transcriptome sequencing","cytoplasm","viral RNAs","UTRs","transcriptome-wide approach","umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus","systemic infection","nonsense-mediated decay","nonviral messenger RNAs","model plant Nicotiana benthamiana","challenge","termination codons","transport","GC-rich","major contributing factor","instances","nucleolus","untranslated regions","Widespread changes","plant\u2019s vascular system","results","current study","abundance"],"language":"en"},

However, such data are lacking. In this study, we designed a device for detecting and recording, second by second, the 3D indoor positioning and head and body motions of each graduate student in an office. From more than 400 person hours of data. Students spent 92.2%, 4.1%, 2.9%, and 0.8% of their time in their own office cubicles, other office cubicles, aisles, and areas near public facilities, respectively. They spent 9.7% of time in close contact, and each student averagely had 4.0 close contacts/h. Students spent long time on close contact in the office which may lead to high infection risk. The average interpersonal distance during close contact was 0.81 m. When sitting, students preferred small relative face orientation angle.

Our goal was to investigate the effects of Pidotimod on RI prevention in children with DS, comparing immune and clinical parameters before (T0) and after (T1) the treatment with Pidotimod. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Down syndrome outpatient Center of Bambino Ges\u00F9 Children\u2019s Hospital, in Rome. We reviewed the medical records of all children with a positive history for RI and who received oral prophylaxis of Pidotimod from September 2016 to February 2017. RESULTS: Thirty-three children met the inclusion criteria (males: 51.5%; average age: 6 years \u00B1SD: 3). We found a significant decrease in the number of children with upper respiratory infections (82% at T0 vs 24% at T1; p = 0,0001) and with lower respiratory infections (36% at T0 vs 9% at T1; p = 0.003) after treatment with Pidotimod. We also demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of children hospitalized for respiratory infections (18% at T0 vs 3% at T1; p = 0.03). We measured T and B cells in the peripheral blood and B cell function in vitro at T0 and T1. We found that the response to CpG improved at T1. A significant increase of B cell frequency (p = 0.0009), B cell proliferation (p = 0.0278) and IgM secretion (p = 0.0478) were observed in children with DS after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided evidence that Pidotimod may be able to prevent RI in children with Down syndrome.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valentini, Diletta; Di Camillo, Chiara; Mirante, Nadia; Marcellini, Valentina; Carsetti, Rita; Villani, Alberto","journal":"Ital J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0f8e122c5aeb424f3f279bd46d3731799dbb7cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pidotimod","CpG"],"locations":["Rome"],"keyphrases":["T1","number of children","T0 vs","effects of Pidotimod","treatment","B cell function","B cell proliferation","upper respiratory infections","lower respiratory infections","RI prevention","B cells","recurrent infections","significant decrease","significant increase of B cell frequency","oral prophylaxis of Pidotimod","RESULTS","immune defects","syndrome outpatient Center of Bambino Ges\u00F9 Children\u2019s Hospital","peripheral blood","high susceptibility","males","average age","evidence","positive history","clinical parameters","inclusion criteria","years","SD","abnormalities","airways","IgM secretion","medical records","CONCLUSIONS","study","response","CpG","BACKGROUND","METHODS","goal"],"language":"en"},

The effect of cholesterol-lowering diets on inflammatory biomarkers is less well known. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a dietary combination (portfolio) of cholesterol-lowering foods vs a statin in reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) as a biomarker of inflammation linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS: In all, 34 hyperlipidemic subjects completed three 1-month treatments as outpatients in random order: a very low-saturated fat diet (control); the same diet with 20 mg lovastatin (statin); and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy protein (21.4 g/1000 kcal), viscous fibers (9.8 g/1000 kcal), and almonds (14 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio). Fasting blood samples were obtained at weeks 0, 2, and 4. RESULTS: Using the complete data, no treatment reduced serum CRP. However, when subjects with CRP levels above the 75th percentile for previously reported studies (\u003E3.5 mg/l) were excluded, CRP was reduced similarly on both statin, \u221216.3\u00B16.7% (n=23, P=0.013) and dietary portfolio, \u221223.8\u00B16.9% (n=25, P=0.001) but not the control, 15.3\u00B113.6% (n=28, P=0.907). The percentage CRP change from baseline on the portfolio treatment (n=25) was greater than the control (n=28, P=0.004) but similar to statin treatment (n=23, P=0.349). Both statin and portfolio treatments were similar in reducing CRP and numerically more effective than control but only the change in portfolio was significant after the Bonferroni adjustment.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a promising candidate due to its oncolytic features reported in a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82 cells). Interestingly, the underlying mechanism might include a dysregulation of angiogenesis. Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of a persistent CDV-infection on oxidative stress mediated changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03B1 and its angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82 cells in vitro. Microarray data analysis, immunofluorescence for 8-hydroxyguanosine, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase, and flow cytometry for oxidative burst displayed an increased oxidative stress in persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells (DH82Ond pi) compared to controls. The HIF-1\u03B1 expression in DH82Ond pi increased, as demonstrated by Western blot, and showed an unexpected, often sub-membranous distribution, as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, microarray data analysis and immunofluorescence confirmed a reduced expression of VEGF-B in DH82Ond pi compared to controls. In summary, these results suggest a reduced activation of the HIF-1\u03B1 angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82Ond pi cells in vitro, most likely due to an excessive, unusually localized, and non-functional expression of HIF-1\u03B1 triggered by a CDV-induced increased oxidative stress.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Armando, Federico; Gambini, Matteo; Corradi, Attilio; Giudice, Chiara; Pfankuche, Vanessa Maria; Brogden, Graham; Attig, Friederike; von K\u00F6ckritz-Blickwede, Maren; Baumg\u00E4rtner, Wolfgang; Puff, Christina","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07134c54c481b79d08d271b83ef12aaf07866957.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077254.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DH82Ond pi cells","\u03B1 expression","increased oxidative stress","CDV-infected DH82 cells","immunofluorescence","non-functional expression of HIF","oxidative burst","\u03B1 angiogenic downstream pathway","expression of hypoxia","reduced expression of VEGF","oxidative stress mediated changes","persistent CDV-infection","Microarray data analysis","controls","Histiocytic sarcomas","reduced activation","canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line","Canine distemper virus","malignant tumors","catalase","oncolytic features","impact","hydroxyguanosine","flow cytometry","promising candidate","new treatment strategies","inducible factor","superoxide dismutase","sub-membranous distribution","present study","aim","results","underlying mechanism","dysregulation of angiogenesis","Western blot","findings","summary","immunoelectron microscopy"],"language":"en"},

Secreted from infected or transfected cells, Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane. In the brain, Tat can be taken up by CNS cells via receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis and its internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must be released in order for it to activate the HIV\u20101 LTR promoter and facilitate HIV\u20101 viral replication in the nucleus. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Because Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. We demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with high\u2010affinity rhodamine\u2010dextran or chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTA\u2010AM attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. Significantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically blocking and knocking down the endolysosome\u2010resident two\u2010pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. This calcium\u2010mediated effect appears to be selective for TPCs because knocking down TRPML1 calcium channels was without effect.

METHODS: RAW264.7 cells (a murine macrophage-like cell line) were cultured in the absence or in the presence of PTS2 (3\u201310 \u03BCM) together with or without IFN-\u03B3 (10 ng/ml). IP-10/CXCL10 expression was measured by specific enzyme-amplified immunoassays and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We found that PTS2 inhibited IFN-\u03B3-induced up-regulation of IP-10/CXCL10 protein level in a dose- and time-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells. RT-PCR experiments showed that PTS2 suppressed IFN-\u03B3-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression at mRNA levels.

CONCLUSION: PTS2 inhibits IFN-\u03B3-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression in RAW264.7 cells by targeting the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway, suggesting that PTS2 could exert anti-inflammatory effects through attenuating the formation of chemokine IP-10/CXCL10.","publish_time":"2010-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Cui; Fu, Jin; Liu, Ziwen; Huang, Huang; Luo, Lan; Yin, Zhimin","journal":"Inflamm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92fca8573cfef7235acba06143c97dbf8ad6f034.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JAK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CXCL10 expression","expression of IP","induced IP","presence of PTS2","regulation of IP","PTS2 inhibited IFN-\u03B3","inhibitory effect of PTS2","STAT1","cells","CXCL10 protein level","formation of chemokine IP","RAW264","RT-PCR experiments","Phosphorylation of JAK1","reverse transcriptase-PCR","JAK2 inhibitor AG490","effects of dipyrithione","anti-inflammatory effects","p38 pathway","specific enzyme-amplified immunoassays","dose","wide variety of chronic inflammatory disorders","time-dependent manner","autoimmune conditions","murine macrophage","cell line","Western blot analysis","study","absence","mRNA levels","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","METHODS","ng","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

So far, the expression of capsid and envelope proteins in infected cells has been considered an absolute requirement for alphavirus budding and propagation. In the present study, we show that Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus lacking the capsid gene can propagate in mammalian and insect cells. This propagation is mediated by the release of infectious microvesicles (iMVs), which are pleomorphic and have a larger size and density than wild-type virus. iMVs, which contain viral RNA inside and viral envelope proteins on their surface, are released at the plasma membrane and infect cells using the endocytic pathway in a similar way to wild-type virus. iMVs are not pathogenic in immunocompetent mice when injected intravenously, but can infect different organs like lungs and heart. Finally, we also show that alphavirus genomes without capsid can mediate the propagation of heterologous genes, making these vectors potentially interesting for gene therapy or vaccination studies. The minimalist infectious system described in this study shows that a self-replicating RNA able to express membrane proteins with binding and fusion properties is able to propagate, providing some insights into virus evolution.

The sequence of each of the 17 satRNAs was unique and was between 334 and 340 nucleotides in length; 57 positions were polymorphic. There was much genetic divergence, ranging from 0.006 to 0.141 nucleotide substitutions per site for pairwise comparisons, and averaging 0.074 for any pair. When the polymorphic positions were analyzed relative to a secondary structure model proposed for CMV-satRNAs, it was found that there were significantly different numbers of changes in base-paired and non\u2013base-paired positions, and that mutations that did not disrupt base pairing were preferred at the putatively paired sites. This supports the concept that the need to maintain a functional structure may limit genetic divergence of CMV-satRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the 17 CMV-satRNA variants clustered into two subgroups, I and II, and evolutionary lines proceeding by the sequential accumulation of mutations were apparent. Three satRNA variants were outliers for these two phylogenetic groups. They were shown to be recombinants of subgroup I and II satRNAs by calculating phylogenies for different molecular regions and by using Sawyer\u0027s test for gene conversion. At least two recombination events were required to produce these three recombinant satRNAs. Thus, recombinants were found to be frequent (\u223C17%) in natural populations of CMV-satRNA, and recombination may make an important contribution to the generation of new variants. To our knowledge this is the first report of data allowing the frequency of recombinant isolates in natural populations of an RNA replicon to be estimated.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aranda, Miguel A.; Fraile, Aurora; Dopazo, Joaqu\u00EDn; Malpica, Jos\u00E9 M.; Garc\u00EDa-Arenal, Fernando","journal":"J Mol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b94b39b145793cdd8f1725b60722cff0e2aa41c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sawyer"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV-satRNA variants","CMV-satRNAs","natural populations of CMV","genetic divergence of CMV","recombinant satRNAs","base-paired positions","polymorphic positions","generation of new variants","base pairing","nucleotide sequence","paired sites","functional structure","RNA replicon","nucleotide substitutions","phylogenetic groups","Phylogenetic analyses","recombination events","recombinants of subgroup","secondary structure model","different molecular regions","frequency of recombinant isolates","sequential accumulation of mutations","different numbers of changes","satellite RNA of cucumber mosaic virus","Sawyer\u0027s test","field-infected tomato plants","important contribution","phylogenies","outliers","report of data","evolutionary lines","springs","gene conversion","comparisons","need","length","nucleotides","subgroups","knowledge","concept"],"language":"en"},

All virus species spread via drinking water are of fecal origin. They are regularly identified in waste water even after conventional multi-stage water treatment. The approved disinfection methods can cope with these viruses if they are not integrated in larger particles. For this reason particle separation is particularly important in water treatment. Virological tests are not reliable enough to ensure that drinking water is sufficiently virus-free. The examination of 100 mL of water for E. coli and coliform bacteria is not adequate proof either. If potentially contaminated raw water is used, consumer safety must be ensured by calculating the performance of water treatment plants on a case-by-case basis. Such a calculation takes into account the virus load of the raw water, the efficiency of the physical and chemical particle elimination steps and the effect of disinfection. Those factors which determine the effectiveness of disinfection, namely concentration and exposure time or UV radiation strength, must be adjusted according to the risk of viral infection, and calculated settings must be adhered to, even if favorable E. coli levels may make them seem excessive.","publish_time":"2007-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Botzenhart, K.","journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b864b9a0a4a41dae0ddba71531d8d23ac193d2d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["drinking water","waste water","observed drinking- water","contaminated raw water","performance of water treatment plants","conventional multi-stage water treatment","effect of disinfection","virus load","effectiveness of disinfection","virus species","virus-free","Viruses","approved disinfection methods","viral infections","coli levels","case basis","reason particle separation","risk of viral infection","chemical particle elimination steps","concentration","exposure time","recent years","coliform bacteria","efficiency","UV radiation strength","large-scale norovirus epidemics","account","adequate proof","calculated settings","consumer safety","infectious diseases","calculation","fecal origin","past","hepatitis","Virological tests","factors","larger particles","examination","Europe"],"language":"en"},

The paper argues that a person with HIV has a responsibility to protect his/her partner in the case of a relationship of love. On the other hand, in the case of \u0022purely\u0022 sexual encounters, each person is responsible for his/her own security and should not rely on the other.

Little information is available on its radiologic manifestations in children. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to characterize the radiographic presentation of children with SARS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We abstracted data (n=62) on the radiologic appearance and course of SARS in pediatric patients with suspect (n=25) or probable (n=37) SARS, diagnosed in five hospital sites located in three cities: Toronto, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Available chest radiographs and thoracic CTs were reviewed for the presence of the following radiographic findings: airspace disease, air bronchograms, airways inflammation and peribronchial thickening, interstitial disease, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients (suspect=25, probable=37) were evaluated for SARS. Patient ages ranged from 5.5 months to 17 years and 11.5 months (average, 6 years and 10 months) with a female-to-male ratio of 32:30. Forty-one patients (66.1%) were in close contact with other probable, suspect, or quarantined cases; 10 patients (16.1%) had recently traveled to WHO-designated affected areas within 10 days; and 7 patients (11.2%) were transferred from other hospitals that had SARS patients. Three patients, who did not have close/hospital contact or travel history to affected areas, were classified as SARS cases based on their clinical signs and symptoms and on the fact that they were living in an endemic area. The most prominent clinical presentations were fever, with a temperature over 38 \u00B0C (100%), cough (62.9%), rhinorrhea (22.6%), myalgia (17.7%), chills (14.5%), and headache (11.3%). Other findings included sore throat (9.7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (9.7%), rigor (8.1%), and lethargy (6.5%). In general, fever and cough were the most common clinical presentations amongst younger pediatric SARS cases (age\u003C10 years), whereas, in addition to these symptoms, headache, myalgia, sore throat, chills, and/or rigor were common in older patients (age\u226510 years). The chest radiographs of 35.5% of patients were normal. The most prominent radiological findings that were observed in the remaining patients were areas of consolidation (45.2%), often peripheral with multifocal lesions in 22.6%. Peribronchial thickening was noted on chest radiographs of 14.5% of patients. Pleural effusion was observed only in one patient (age 17 years and 11.5 months), whereas interstitial disease was not observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: In pediatric cases, SARS manifests with nonspecific radiographic features making radiological differentiation difficult, especially from other commonly encountered childhood respiratory viral illnesses causing airspace disease. The radiographic presentation of suspected SARS cases ranged from normal to mild perihilar peribronchial thickening. The radiographic presentations, as expected, were relatively more pronounced in the SARS probable cases.","publish_time":"2003-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Babyn, Paul S.; Chu, Winnie C.

Modelling approaches can sometimes fail to predict disease spread, which may partly be due to the number of unknown sources of variation in host behaviour. The European badger is a wildlife reservoir for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Britain and Ireland, and individual behaviour has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the spread of bTB among badgers and to cattle. Radio-telemetry devices were deployed on 40 badgers from eight groups to investigate patterns of den (sett) use in a high-density population, where each group had one or two main and three to eight outlier setts in their territory. Badgers were located at their setts for 28 days per season for 1 year to investigate how patterns differed between individuals. Denning behaviour may have a strong influence on contact patterns and the transmission of disease. We found significant heterogeneity, influenced by season, sex and age. Also, when controlling for these, bTB infection status interacting with season was highly correlated with sett use. Test-positive badgers spent more time away from their main sett than those that tested negative. We speculate that wider-ranging behaviour of test-positive animals may result in them contacting sources of infection more frequently and/or that their behaviour may be influenced by their disease status. Measures to control infectious diseases might be improved by targeting functional groups, specific areas or times of year that may contribute disproportionately to disease spread.

The current work assessed the association of organizational jurisdiction, organizational attributes, and training opportunities with three different measures of public health preparedness in the province of Alberta, Canada. METHODS: Organizational representatives involved in the delivery of public health systems completed an online questionnaire that asked about organizational attributes and training opportunities available to employees, their perception of organizational preparedness, and their connections to other organizations in Alberta. RESULTS: Findings revealed that (1) perceived human and material resources preparedness was associated with training opportunities, (2) perceived informational needs was associated with organizational size, and (3) whether an organization exercised their written preparedness plan in 2006 was associated with organizational jurisdiction.

Sendai virus causes a localized respiratory tract infection in rodents, while a mutant, F1-R, causes a systemic infection. It has been suggested that two determinants are responsible for the systemic infection caused by F1-R [Okada et al (1998) Arch Virol 143:2343\u20132352]. The primary determinant of the pantropism is the enhanced proteolytic cleavability of the fusion (F) protein of F1-R, which allows the virus to undergo multiple rounds of replication in many different organs, whereas wild-type virus can only undergo multiple rounds of replication in the lungs. The enhanced cleavability of F1-R F was previously attributed to an amino acid change at F115 that is adjacent to the cleavage site at amino acid 116. Secondly, wild-type virus buds only from the apical domain of bronchial epithelium, releasing virus into the lumen of the respiratory tract, whereas F1-R buds from both apical and basolateral domains. Thus, virus is released into the basement membrane where it can easily gain access to the bloodstream for dissemination. The microtubule disruption is attributed to two amino acid differences in M protein. To confirm that the F and M gene mutations described above are solely responsible for the phenotypic differences seen in wld-type versus F1-R infections, reverse genetics was used to construct recombinant Sendai viruses with various combinations of the mutations found in the M and F genes of F1-R. Plaque assays were performed with or without trypsin addition. A recombinant virus containing all F1-R M and F mutations formed plaques in LLC-MK2 cells and underwent multiple cycles of replication without trypsin addition. To clarify which mutation(s) are necessary for plaque formation, plaque assays were done using other recombinant viruses. A virus with only the F115 change, which was previously thought to be the only change important for plaque formation of F 1-R F, did not confer upon the virus the ability to form plaques without the addition of trypsin. Another virus with the F115 and both M changes gave the same result. Therefore, more than one mutation in the F gene contributes to the ability of F1-R to form plaques without trypsin addition.","publish_time":"2004-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Xiaogang; Suquilanda, Edgar; Zeledon, Ana; Kacsinta, Apollo; Moore, Akila; Seto, Joseph; McQueen, Nancy","journal":"Med Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5672ab4d7663c203ea732e2f677e9533607d9b98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzcxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R F","F1-R buds","F1-R infections","SARS virus","F genes of F1","protein of F1","F mutations","wild-type virus buds","plaque formation of F","avian influenza virus","enhanced cleavability of F1","trypsin addition","addition of trypsin","Plaque assays","plaques","recombinant viruses","amino acid change","F115 change","multiple rounds of replication","recombinant Sendai viruses","amino acid differences","systemic infection","gene mutations","multiple cycles of replication","wld-type","localized respiratory tract infection","change important","enhanced proteolytic cleavability","emergence of new viruses","phenotypic differences","genetic basis of viral infections","apical domain of bronchial epithelium","importance of investigations","LLC-MK2 cells","rodents","different organs","fusion","reverse genetics","pantropism","various combinations","cleavage site","Okada et","lumen","mutant","basolateral domains","access","determinants","lungs","Arch Virol","primary determinant","microtubule disruption","basement membrane","bloodstream","dissemination","changes","result"],"language":"en"},

They were characterized by comparison with twenty-six Chinese reference strains and five other IBV strains. Chinese IBVs, which were mainly nephropathogenic, were placed into seven genotypes. Fourteen Chinese IBV isolates were placed in genotype I, having small evolutionary distances from each other. Genotype II included 6 strains that were isolated in the 1990s in China. Genotype III consisted of eight Chinese isolates that showed close relationship with Korean IBV isolates. Another eight IBV isolates clustered in genotype IV and showed larger evolutionary distances. The Massachusetts serotype was present in China in 1990s and was in a separate genotype. Two isolates, HN99 and CK/CH/LHN/00I, which might be a reisolation of vaccine strains, clustered into genotype VI. Four Chinese IBV isolates formed another genotype and showed larger evolutionary distances from other Chinese IBV genotypes (genotype VII). IBVs in same genotypes showed more than 90% amino acid sequence similarities, whereas most of the viruses in different genotypes showed less than 90%. The results showed that IBVs in China came from genetic changes both in IBV populations that existed before the advent of vaccination and in the viruses that were introduced through live vaccines. IBVs showing various genetic differences are cocirculating in China.","publish_time":"2006-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, S. W.; Zhang, Q. X.; Chen, J. D.; Han, Z. X.; Liu, X.; Feng, L.; Shao, Y.

Selected regions of the fusion (F) gene were sequenced, analyzed and compared. The F gene of all isolates contained conserved motifs homologous to those described for other members of the family Paramyxoviridae including: signal peptide, transmembrane domain, furin cleavage site, fusion peptide, N-linked glycosylation sites, and two heptad repeats, the second of which (HRB-LZ) had the characteristics of a leucine zipper. Selected regions of the fusion gene of isolate Gono-GER85 were inserted into a prokaryotic expression system to generate three recombinant protein fragments of various sizes. The longest recombinant protein was cleaved by furin into two fragments of predicted length. Western blot analysis with virus-neutralizing rabbit-antiserum against this isolate demonstrated that only the longest construct reacted with the antiserum. This construct was unique in containing 30 additional C-terminal amino acids that included most of the HRB-LZ. These results indicate that the F genes of reptilian paramyxoviruses contain highly conserved motifs typical of other members of the family and suggest that the HRB-LZ domain of the reptilian paramyxovirus F protein contains a linear antigenic epitope.","publish_time":"2005-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franke, J.; Batts, W.

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is elevated in bacterial but not in viral infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of children in the PID-ARI.net study on respiratory infections to address the question of whether plasma PCT could potentially distinguish between bacterial infections requiring antibiotic therapy and viral ARI. We analysed data on 327 children who had been included in the German PID-ARI.net study and in whom nasopharyngeal aspirates had been analysed with a 19-valent multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction\u2013enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for viral and atypical bacterial pathogens. Serum PCT was determined using a quantitative immunoassay (BRAHMS Kryptor PCTsensitive, Henningsdorf, Germany). We then focussed specifically on those children who were treated with antibiotics and therefore had been suspected of having bacterial infection but who had a serum PCT level lower than 0.1 ng/ml. RESULTS: Out of 327 children, 132 had serum PCT levels below 0.1 ng/ml. Of these 132, 38 children had been treated with antibiotics. After exclusion of 26 patients (with critical illnesses, antibiotics on admission or for reasons other than ARI), 12 children remained for further evaluation. Of these 12 children, four had atypical pneumonia; four others had positive virus testing, and, in the last four, the aetiology of ARI remained unknown; evidence of bacterial infection could not be detected in any. CONCLUSIONS: Taken the results of this retrospective analysis, serum PCT values below 0.1 ng/ml might be a marker to identify children with acute respiratory tract infection in whom antibiotic treatment could be withheld. However, only a prospective intervention trial will prove the general safety of this limit.","publish_time":"2008-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00FCtzle, Heike; Forster, Johannes; Superti-Furga, Andrea; Berner, Reinhard","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae87f75791a69029c1f6138b2e9c9de0f3f0f4f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozc0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["bacterial infections","retrospective analysis of children","serum PCT values","serum PCT levels","evidence of bacterial infection","antibiotics","respiratory infections","viral infections","viral ARI","plasma PCT","serum PCT level lower","atypical bacterial pathogens","Serum procalcitonin","Acute respiratory tract infections","aetiology of ARI","study","RESULTS","PATIENTS","antibiotic therapy","antibiotic treatment","atypical pneumonia","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","valent multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","BRAHMS Kryptor PCTsensitive","quantitative immunoassay","Henningsdorf","admission","general safety","critical illnesses","Germany","INTRODUCTION","question","marker","prospective intervention trial","positive virus testing","METHODS","reasons","nasopharyngeal aspirates","limit","exclusion","CONCLUSIONS","data","evaluation"],"language":"en"}]}

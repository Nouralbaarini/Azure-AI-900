The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility. An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium. Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17\u00DF-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney. Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy. In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition. Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies. Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"La Vignera, Sandro; Cannarella, Rossella; Condorelli, Rosita A; Torre, Francesco; Aversa, Antonio; Calogero, Aldo E","journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21082948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32331343/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of ACE2","activity of ACE2","higher myocardial ACE2 expression","SARS-CoV","hypogonadal men","elderly men","different predisposition","different susceptibility","COVID","penetration of SARS","epidemiological aspects","presence of comorbidities","recent evidence","epidemiological results","possible sex-dependent susceptibility","sex hormones","higher mortality rate","greater genetic predisposition","females","increased frequency of venous thromboembolism","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","patients","testosterone","hypertensive male mice","vitamin D deficiency","attention","worse prognosis","clinical element","lethality","adipose tissue","study","levels","angiotensin","safety of treatment","epithelial cells","\u00DF-estradiol","experimental animal","appropriate intervention strategies","enzymatic system","sexes","kidney","disease","Data","spike protein","myocardium","orchiectomy","enzyme","addition"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 561 professionals (42.6% males, 26.9% \u2265 50-year-old) compiled a specifically designed web questionnaire on characteristics of POC rapid tests. They were asked whether they would change daily practice and make clinical decisions according to POC tests. Multivariate odds ratios (aOR) for predictors of propensity towards the aforementioned behavioral outcomes were calculated through regression analysis. RESULTS Overall, only 51.9% knew the official recommendations of the Italian Health Authorities for POC tests, while 26.0% of respondents considered POC tests for COVID-19 highly reliable. Still, 40.3% of respondents would change daily practice because of such tests, and 38.5% would make clinical decisions based of their results. Actual understanding of specificity and sensitivity of POC tests was not associated with assessed behavioral outcomes: main positive effectors were identified in perceived reliability and usefulness of rapid tests, acknowledging the existence of official recommendations, understanding the limited clinical implications of POC tests, and working as occupational physicians were characterized as negative effectors. Conclusions. Propensity of sampled professionals towards POC tests for COVID-19 was diffusely unsatisfying. While actual understanding of accuracy of such tests was not a main effector of propensity, previous experiences with other POC tests in daily practice, particularly among occupational physicians may have impaired overall acceptance of such instruments.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ricc\u00F2, Matteo; Ferraro, Pietro; Gualerzi, Giovanni; Ranzieri, Silvia; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Balzarini, Federica; Signorelli, Carlo","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitivity of POC tests","characteristics of POC rapid tests","usefulness of rapid tests","limited clinical implications of POC tests","daily practice","clinical decisions","Propensity of sampled professionals","occupational physicians","predictors of propensity","main effector of propensity","COVID","Actual understanding of specificity","respondents","actual understanding of accuracy","RESULTS","assessed behavioral outcomes","main positive effectors","aforementioned behavioral outcomes","sample of medical professionals","existence of official recommendations","negative effectors","impaired overall acceptance","perceived reliability","previous experiences","Italian Health Authorities","designed web questionnaire","beliefs","aOR","point","care","SARS-CoV","knowledge","attitudes","Multivariate odds ratios","present study","regression analysis","instruments","METHODS","total","MATERIAL","INTRODUCTION","Italy","year-old","males","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Resistance is mainly caused by the presence of a subpopulation of tumor cells, the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. In 2015, Zikavirus (ZIKV)-induced microcephaly emerged in newborns, indicating that ZIKV has a specific neurotropism. Accordingly, an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs was demonstrated in a murine tumor model. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is enveloped by two proteins, prM and E. The pME expression plasmid along with the HIV-1 vector pNL Luc AM generated prME pseudotyped viral particles. Four different prME envelopes, Z1 to Z4, were cloned, and the corresponding pseudotypes, Z1- to Z4-HIVluc, produced by this two-plasmid system, were tested for entry efficiency using Vero-B4 cells. The most efficient pseudotype, Z1-HIVluc, also infected glioma-derived cell lines U87 and 86HG39. The pseudotype system was then extended by using a three-plasmid system including pME-Z1, the HIV-1 packaging plasmid psPAX2, and the lentiviral vector pLenti-luciferase-P2A-Neo. The corresponding pseudotype, designated Z1-LENTIluc, also infected U87 and 86HG39 cells. Altogether, a pseudotyped virus especially targeting glioma-derived cells might be a promising candidate for a prospective glioblastoma-directed virotherapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kretschmer, Maibritt; Kadlubowska, Patrycja; Hoffmann, Daniel; Schwalbe, Birco; Auerswald, Heidi; Schreiber, Michael","journal":"Cancers","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12041000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325703/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","E.

This study aims to compare the fusion and subsidence rates of titanium (Ti) versus polyetheretherketone (PEEK) interbody cages after posterior lumbar interbody fusion and investigate the effect of clinical and radiological outcomes following fusion on patient-reported outcomes. METHODS A systematic search strategy of 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane) was conducted using different MeSH (medical subject headings) terms until January 2020. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using fixed and random-effect models based upon the heterogeneity (I2) to estimate the association between interbody cages and the measured outcomes. RESULTS A total of 1,094 patients from 11 studies were reviewed. The final analysis included 421 patients (38.5%) who had lumbar surgery using a Ti and/or a Ti-coated interbody cage and 673 patient (61.5%) who had lumbar surgery using a PEEK cage. Overall, PEEK interbody devices were associated with a significantly lower fusion rate compared with Ti interbody devices (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93; p = 0.02). There was no difference in subsidence rates between Ti and PEEK groups (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.54-1.52; p = 0.71). Also, there were no statistically significant differences in visual analogue scale (VAS)-low back pain (p = 0.14) and Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (p = 0.86) between the 2 groups. However, the PEEK group had lower odds of leg pain after surgery compared to the Ti group (OR [VAS-leg], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.28-0.94; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION Ti and Ti-coated PEEK cages used for posterior lumbar interbody fusion are associated with similar rates of subsidence, but a higher rate of fusion compared to PEEK interbody cages. Randomized controlled trials are needed to better assess the effect of cage materials and potential factors that could influence the outcomes of interbody lumbar fusion.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massaad, Elie; Fatima, Nida; Kiapour, Ali; Hadzipasic, Muhamed; Shankar, Ganesh M; Shin, John H","journal":"Neurospine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.14245/ns.2040058.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32252163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Orthopedic Association"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcomes of interbody lumbar fusion","PEEK interbody cages","posterior lumbar interbody fusion","Ti interbody devices","PEEK interbody devices","OBJECTIVE Lumbar fusion","Ti-coated PEEK cages","implantation of interbody cage","Ti group","lumbar surgery","CONCLUSION Ti","PEEK groups","lower fusion rate","higher rate of fusion","effect of cage materials","treatment of lumbar degenerative disease","radiological outcomes","measured outcomes","subsidence rates of titanium","similar rates of subsidence","effect of clinical","lower odds of leg pain","VAS-leg","patients","random-effect models","Japanese Orthopedic Association scale","visual analogue scale","Pooled odds ratios","common procedure","electronic databases","MEDLINE","different MeSH","systematic search strategy","medical subject headings","Embase","potential factors","polyetheretherketone","Web of Science","significant differences","Cochrane","terms","METHODS","I2","heterogeneity","confidence intervals","Randomized controlled trials","total","studies","final analysis","study"],"language":"en"},

Genetics is an important factor leading to schizophrenia, but its exact role is still unclear. Many studies have focused on neurotransmitters and regulators that participate in the processes mediated by these neurotransmitters. Alcohol dehydrogenase may not only catalyze the oxidation of retinol and ethanol but also be involved in a variety of neurotransmitter metabolic pathways. Therefore, our study investigated whether ADH7 gene variations in the Chinese Han population were associated with schizophrenia. Genomic DNA was extracted from a cohort of 275 schizophrenic patients (136 men and 139 women) and 313 healthy controls (160 men and 153 women) from the Northern Han Chinese population. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and linkage disequilibrium analysis were performed. Differences in genotypes, alleles, and haplotypes between the schizophrenic and control groups were determined using the chi-square test and correlation analysis. The distribution of the CC \u002B TT genotype of rs284787 was statistically different between the case and control groups (p = 0.026, OR = 1.448); however, the difference disappeared after Bonferroni correction. Linkage analysis indicated that rs739147, rs284787, rs3805329, rs894369, rs3805331, and rs284786 were closely linked in one block. The haplotype analysis found no association between the composed haplotypes and the occurrence of schizophrenia. Our study showed that the ADH7 gene was not associated with the risk of schizophrenia.

Today, it is a pandemic infection, and even if several compounds are used as curative or supportive treatment, there is not a definitive treatment. In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury. In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange. Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab). In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gallelli, Luca; Zhang, Leiming; Wang, Tian; Fu, Fenghua","journal":"Journal of clinical pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALI","supportive treatment","antiviral treatment","definitive treatment","Acute lung injury","viral infections","add-on therapy","COVID","pandemic infection","anti-viral effects","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","severe form","coronavirus disease","Ebola","release of proinflammatory mediators","potent anti-inflammatory","intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation","inflammation","agent","HIV","hepatitis C","edema","drugs able","use of escin","monoclonal antibodies","inflammatory burst","interferon","corticosteroids","moderate effect","therapeutic opportunity","literature data","gas exchange","cell activation","compounds","curative","article","tocilizumab","fact"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS Out of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p\u003C0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed that CRP remained robust accuracy in adverse outcome prediction in patients with different disease severity (AUC 0.832, z=10.23, p\u003C0.001; AUC 0.989, z=44.04, p\u003C0.001). CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p\u003C0.001).

We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=12) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBS than are typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sriram, Krishna; Insel, Paul A","journal":"Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors","Angiotensin Receptor Blockers","ACEI/ARB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of ACE2","ARBs","ACE2 protein expression data","human studies","ARB use increases ACE2 expression","administration of ACEIs","plurality of studies","ACE2 activity assays","patients","higher doses of ACEIs","literature review of studies","experimental animals","sham animals","hypothesis","human subjects","COVID","Angiotensin Receptor Blockers","safety of Angiotensin","impact of administration","Available evidence","respect","response","Enzyme Inhibitors","acute injury models","risk of complications","treatment","effect","findings","medications","approved indications","SARS-CoV","Control","Concerns"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioral therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and homeschooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Altena, Ellemarije; Baglioni, Chiara; Espie, Colin A; Ellis, Jason; Gavriloff, Dimitri; Holzinger, Brigitte; Schlarb, Angelika; Frase, Lukas; Jernel\u00F6v, Susanna; Riemann, Dieter","journal":"Journal of sleep research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sleep disturbance","sleep problems","sleep quality","stress-sleep link","current home confinement situation","current global home confinement situation","daytime stress","health anxiety","social interaction","unprecedented stressful situation of unknown duration","disruptions of social relationships","direct consequences","plays","emotion regulation","requirements","physical exercise","adaptions of cognitive behavioral therapy elements","depression levels","COVID","individuals","day emotional functioning","general limitations","effects","changed work schedules","fundamental role","effective insomnia treatment","homeschooling","outbreak","paper"],"language":"en"},

It has been shown to significantly alleviate anxiety and improve patient satisfaction. In this study, we aimed to compare music therapy to a control (no music) group with respect to sedation requirements, anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Methods In this randomized controlled study, we compared the effect of music therapy in patients \u2265 18 years old. Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were screened for the study to rule out any contraindications for spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio for either the \u0022music\u0022 or \u0022control\u0022 group. Both groups were compared for sedation requirements, preoperative and postoperative anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction. Results Subjects in the music group had a statistically significant lower than average State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State baseline score as compared to the control group (music group 31.00 (standard deviation (SD) 1.44), control group 38.04 (SD 2.35); p = 0.01). Postoperative STAI-State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State scores for the music group were lower for the music group than the control group (music group 28.34 (SD 1.64), control group 32.21 (SD 1.56), p= 0.09). STAI-Trait scores were similar pre-operatively, but significantly less post-operatively in the music group (28.14 SD 1.0) as compared to the control group (34.71 SD 2.31); p = 0.01. Propofol dose per kilogram per surgical minute was similar between the two groups (music group 0.05, control group 0.06; p= 0.264). Patient satisfaction scores with their perioperative experience were higher in the music group (p= 0.009). Conclusions Music therapy may be offered as an alternative to traditional anxiolytics intra-operatively. However further studies are warranted to evaluate whether or not music therapy can decrease sedation and anxiolytic medications during surgery. The type and mode of delivery of music also need to be studied to better understand the impact of music therapy.

Methods: Based on the case data reported in Hubei province during the COVID-19 epidemic, combined with the important time of major interventions and event, the cumulative attack rate, the sequential increase rate of new cases, baseline increase rate of new cases, the observation- confirmed case conversion rate, the cumulative crude mortality, the daily severe case rate, and the ratio of death to severe were used to describe and analyze the epidemic characteristics in different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. Results: The epidemic experienced an outbreak phase from January 10 to February 3 with large amount of case reported, a peak phase from February 4 to February 19 with continuous increasing number of new cases and deaths, a platform phase from February 20 to March 3 with balanced diagnosis and treatment number, and a descending phase from March 4 to March 18 with decreased diagnosis and increased treatment number. Up to March 18, the cumulative attack rate of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province increased from 0.03/10 000 on January 19 to 11.46/10 000, from 0.04/10 000 on January 10 to 45.13/10 000 in Wuhan city, and from 0.002/ 10 000 on January 20 to 3.70/ 10 000 in other areas of Hubei province other than Wuhan city. The increase rate of new cases fluctuated during the epidemic period and reached the highest at February 12 in Hubei province. The cumulative crude mortality in Hubei Province increased rapidly from 1.01% on January 19 to 5.13% on January 26, then decreased to 2.54% on February 13, and then slowly increased to 4.62% on March 18, and similar trend was also observed in Wuhan city. The daily severe rate in Hubei Province increased from 26.88% on January 27 to 34.27% on March 18. The ratio of death to severe decreased from 7.37% on January 23 to 0.35% on March 18. Conclusions: The epidemic cycle of COVID-19 in Hubei province proposed to be 60 days, which was about 1.76 times of the combination of the longest incubation period or isolation period (14 d) and the average hospitalization time of confirmed patients in Hubei province (20 d). It suggested that the major anti-epidemic decisions made in China were effective.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Y; Liu, M; Jia, W P; Wang, S S; Cao, W Z; Han, K; Yang, S S; Li, J; Chen, Z; He, Y","journal":"Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200321-00409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hubei","China"],"keyphrases":["epidemic period","areas of Hubei province","epidemic trends","epidemic characteristics","cumulative attack rate","epidemic cycle of COVID","daily severe rate","daily severe case rate","case conversion rate","sequential increase rate of new cases","major anti-epidemic decisions","cumulative crude mortality","increased treatment number","pandemic of COVID","Wuhan city","continuous increasing number of new cases","case data","platform phase","decreased diagnosis","descending phase","outbreak phase","peak phase","isolation period","ratio of death","longest incubation period","important time of major interventions","balanced diagnosis","average hospitalization time of confirmed patients","event","baseline","deaths","relevant indexes","observation","China","different phases","combination","comprehensive evaluations","effects of intervention measures","times","Conclusions","days","similar trend","Methods","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

These included large event bans, school closures, closures of entertainment venues, gyms, bars, and restaurant dining areas, and shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs). We evaluated the impact of these measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across US counties between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. An event-study design allowed each policy\u0027s impact on COVID-19 case growth to evolve over time. Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate by 5.4 percentage points after 1-5 days, 6.8 after 6-10 days, 8.2 after 11-15 days, and 9.1 after 16-20 days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply 10 times greater spread by April 27 without SIPOs (10 million cases) and more than 35 times greater spread without any of the four measures (35 million). Our paper illustrates the potential danger of exponential spread in the absence of interventions, providing relevant information to strategies for restarting economic activity.

Our objective was to assess the nature and extent of the body of research on AI for primary care. METHODS We performed a scoping review, searching 11 published or gray literature databases with terms pertaining to AI (eg, machine learning, bayes* network) and primary care (eg, general pract*, nurse). We performed title and abstract and then full-text screening using Covidence. Studies had to involve research, include both AI and primary care, and be published in Eng-lish. We extracted data and summarized studies by 7 attributes: purpose(s); author appointment(s); primary care function(s); intended end user(s); health condition(s); geographic location of data source; and AI subfield(s). RESULTS Of 5,515 unique documents, 405 met eligibility criteria. The body of research focused on developing or modifying AI methods (66.7%) to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations (36.5% and 13.8%), for chronic conditions, using data from higher-income countries. Few studies (14.1%) had even a single author with a primary care appointment. The predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning (40.0%) and expert systems (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS Research on AI for primary care is at an early stage of maturity. For the field to progress, more interdisciplinary research teams with end-user engagement and evaluation studies are needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kueper, Jacqueline K; Terry, Amanda L; Zwarenstein, Merrick; Lizotte, Daniel J","journal":"Annals of family medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary care appointment","primary care function","AI methods","body of research","predominant AI subfields","CONCLUSIONS Research","evaluation studies","summarized studies","interdisciplinary research teams","author appointment","geographic location of data source","supervised machine learning","single author","comprehensive review","scoping review","PURPOSE Rapid increases","end-user engagement","health condition","application of artificial intelligence","technology","end user","bayes","network","attributes","unique documents","gray literature databases","progress","terms","higher-income countries","early stage of maturity","text screening","physician diagnostic","treatment recommendations","eligibility criteria","nature","chronic conditions","extent","Covidence","RESULTS","efforts","expert systems","Eng-lish","title","objective","nurse"],"language":"en"},

In an attempt to limit the spread of infection and to preserve healthcare resources, one commonly used strategy has been to postpone elective surgery, whilst maintaining the provision of anaesthetic care for urgent and emergency surgery. General anaesthesia with airway intervention leads to aerosol generation, which increases the risk of COVID-19 contamination in operating rooms and significantly exposes the healthcare teams to COVID-19 infection during both tracheal intubation and extubation. Therefore, the provision of regional anaesthesia may be key during this pandemic, as it may reduce the need for general anaesthesia and the associated risk from aerosol-generating procedures. However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. The goal of this review is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations, or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: (1) planning of resources and staffing; (2) modifying the clinical environment; (3) preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; (4) selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; (5) providing adequate oxygen therapy; (6) assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and (7) monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care. Implicit in these recommendations is preserving patient safety whilst protecting healthcare providers from possible exposure.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uppal, V; Sondekoppam, R V; Landau, R; El-Boghdadly, K; Narouze, S; Kalagara, H K P","journal":"Anaesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regional anaesthesia procedures","General anaesthesia","provision of regional anaesthesia","conduct of anaesthesia","risk of COVID","safe performance of regional anaesthesia","healthcare resources","confirmed COVID","healthcare providers","healthcare teams","global healthcare services","provision of anaesthetic care","evidence-based recommendations","spread of infection","pandemic","post-anaesthetic care","associated risk","aerosol generation","elective surgery","emergency surgery","planning of resources","appropriate personal protective equipment","light","patients","patient safety","airway intervention","expert opinion","used strategy","operating rooms","significant impact","contamination","key","possible exposure","tracheal intubation","review","extubation","guidelines","need","monitoring","specific domains","adequate oxygen therapy","staffing","drugs","attempt","Coronavirus disease","clinical environment","goal"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that hemin impairs inactivation of K\u002B channels formed by Kv3.4 \u03B1 subunits as well as that induced by the subunits Kv\u03B21.1, Kv\u03B21.2, and Kv\u03B23.1 when coexpressed with \u03B1 subunits of the Kv1 subfamily. In Kv\u03B21.1, hemin interacts with cysteine and histidine residues in the N terminus (C7 and H10) with high affinity (EC50 100 nM). Similarly, rapid inactivation of Kv4.2 channels induced by the dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein DPP6a is also sensitive to hemin, and the DPP6a mutation C13S eliminates this dependence. The results suggest a common mechanism for a dynamic regulation of Kv channel inactivation by heme/hemin in N-terminal ball domains of Kv \u03B1 and auxiliary \u03B2 subunits. Free intracellular heme therefore has the potential to regulate cellular excitability via modulation of Kv channel inactivation.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coburger, Ina; Yang, Kefan; Bernert, Alisa; Wiesel, Eric; Sahoo, Nirakar; Swain, Sandip M; Hoshi, Toshinori; Sch\u00F6nherr, Roland; Heinemann, Stefan H","journal":"Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-020-02386-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388729/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B1 subunits","subunits Kv\u03B21","hemin","auxiliary \u03B2 subunits","channels","N-terminal ball domains of Kv \u03B1","modulation of Kv channel inactivation","N-type inactivation of voltage","N terminus","dynamic regulation of Kv channel inactivation","rapid inactivation of Kv4","electrical cellular excitability","protein DPP6a","DPP6a mutation C13S","Free intracellular heme","H10","C7","potential","histidine residues","high affinity","common mechanism","EC50","dipeptidyl peptidase","cysteine","pore","nM","dependence","Kv1 subfamily","Kv3","results","Kv\u03B23"],"language":"en"},

Our previous exome-wide analyses found a Val1937Ile variant (rs17848945) in the 34th exon of fatty acid synthase (FASN) that showed a strong association with the risk of ESCC. In this study, we performed a series of functional assays to investigate the biological functions underlying this variant in the development of ESCC. We demonstrated that FASN was upregulated in ESCC and both knockdown and knockout of FASN significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor promoter role for this gene in ESCC. Furthermore, the results showed that overexpression of FASN[I] in the ESCC cells substantially enhanced cell proliferation, compared with overexpression of FASN[V], or the control vector. Intriguingly, we found that the FASN[I] variant can enhance the enzyme activity of FASN, and, thus, increase the amount of the FASN end-product, palmitate in the ESCC cells. We also observed elevated palmitate levels in the plasma of the FASN[I] genotype carriers among a total of 632 healthy Chinese adults. In conclusion, our results suggested that the FASN V1937I variant influenced ESCC cell proliferation and susceptibility by altering the catabolic activity of FASN on palmitate.

Of interest, 6 years earlier, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid carcinoma and, in the meantime, she was submitted to mastectomy to treat an invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. In order to explain these lesions, an extensive genetic study was performed. Results showed positivity for the presence of the tumor suppressor gene PALB2, whose presence had already been detected in a niece with breast cancer. The patient underwent different procedures to treat the lesions and currently she is symptom-free over 2 years of follow-up. Learning points The presence of two rare neoplasms in a single person should raise the suspicion of a common etiology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that shows the coexistence of DIPNECH and paraganglioma. The contribution of the PALB2 gene in the etiology of these rare neoplasms is a possibility.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedro, J; Cunha, F M; Neto, V; Hespanhol, V; Martins, D F; Guimar\u00E3es, S; Varela, A; Carvalho, D","journal":"Endocrinology, diabetes \u0026 metabolism case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-19-0141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408270/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DIPNECH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence","PALB2 gene","rare neoplasms","lesions","case","patient","coexistence of DIPNECH","tumor suppressor gene PALB2","common etiology","breast cancer","years of follow-up","papillary thyroid carcinoma","invasive ductal carcinoma","carotid body paraganglioma","simultaneous appearance of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia","total thyroidectomy","suspicion","mastectomy","year-old woman","single person","extensive genetic study","meantime","symptom-free","positivity","different procedures","knowledge","niece","Results","possibility","contribution","Learning","best","Summary","order"],"language":"en"},

However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporo-parietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bolay, Hayrunnisa; G\u00FCl, Ahmet; Baykan, Bet\u00FCl","journal":"Headache","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/head.13856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bilateral headache","symptomatic COVID","hospitalized COVID","significant features of headache presentation","possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache","common non-respiratory symptom of COVID","patients","clinical features","striking features","symptom list","presenting symptom","manifestations of respiratory system","common analgesics","gradual onset","new onset","SARS-CoV2","novel coronavirus","coronavirus disease","clinical spectrum","activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings","poor response","dyspnea","diarrhea","moderate-severe","increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines","abdominal pain","temporo-parietal","hypoxia","cough","smell","quality","pulsating","loss of taste","initial experience","high relapse rate","forehead","sore throat","vasculopathy","headaches","course","periorbital region","fever","emergence","neurological findings","leader","available publications","reports","active phase","pandemic","characteristics","scrutiny"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this scoping review is to critically appraise and synthesize the evidence in the reported number of falls, fear of falling, and risk factors associated with falls in older patients waiting for or recovering from TJA. METHODS Seven electronic databases were searched with no date limits and using language restriction (English). The inclusion criteria were 1) cohorts that included older adults 60\u002B years of age, 2) reported prevalence of falls, fear of falling, and/or risk factors for falls in patients who were waiting or recovering from TJA and 3) cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, and case control study designs. The quality assessment of selected articles was assessed using the SIGN Guidelines Checklist. RESULTS Of the 866 citations identified, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Prevalence of falls in pre-operative TJA patients and post-operative TJA patients ranged from 23 to 63%, and 13 to 42%, respectively. Of those five studies that examined fear of falling, pre-operative TJA patients reported greater fear of falling than post-operative patients. Modifiable risk factors for falls included fear of falling, joint range of motion, and depression. CONCLUSIONS An increased risk of falls in patients with TJA was reported both for patients waiting for and recovering from surgery. A number of modifiable risk factors were identified including fear of falling that could be targeted in fall prevention programs for TJA.","publish_time":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Serena Kuangyi; Voaklander, Don; Perry, Danielle; Jones, C Allyson","journal":"BMC musculoskeletal disorders","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-019-2954-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TJA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-operative TJA patients","post-operative TJA patients","older patients","post-operative patients","BACKGROUND Patients","increased risk of falls","prevalence of falls","reported number of falls","greater fear","number of modifiable risk factors","cohort studies","cross-sectional studies","inclusion criteria","older adults","language restriction","restriction of activity","total joint arthroplasty","joint range of motion","date limits","case control study designs","cohorts","quality assessment of selected articles","electronic databases","years of age","SIGN Guidelines Checklist","English","depression","fall prevention programs","CONCLUSIONS","evidence","objective","scoping review","METHODS","recovery","citations","RESULTS","surgery"],"language":"en"},

In particular, this report offers opportunities to build on experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants. Observations Italy has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. Many challenges have occurred in the management of health services. In many hospitals, entire wards, including some psychiatric wards, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19, and many physicians and nurses have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Most day facilities for patients with psychiatric needs have been temporarily closed, whereas in residential facilities, patients who usually are free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with severe mental disorders. Many outpatient clinics have limited appointments to those with the most urgent cases, and home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced with potentially detrimental consequences for patients\u0027 well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the hours spent face to face with families with high amounts of conflict. Conclusions and Relevance Departments of Mental Health need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine. Departments of Mental Health should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations, and this requires the acquisition of new skills, notably how to correctly inform the population about risk, train and disseminate effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, support health personnel and rescuers, and support those experiencing bereavement.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Girolamo, Giovanni; Cerveri, Giancarlo; Clerici, Massimo; Monzani, Emiliano; Spinogatti, Franco; Starace, Fabrizio; Tura, Giambattista; Vita, Antonio","journal":"JAMA psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352480/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Mental Health System","Relevance Departments of Mental Health","Mental Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","management of health services","experience of mental health services","National Mental Health System","management of DMHAs","Relevance Departments of Mental Health need","support health personnel","management procedures","Lombardy","appropriate e-health technologies","severe mental disorders","psychiatric wards","day facilities","psychosocial management of disasterlike situations","entire wards","residential facilities","detrimental consequences","face","home visits","important changes","psychiatric needs","potential detrimental consequence","harmful consequences of quarantine","disasters","people","rescuers","considerable stresses","families","train","lessons","Addiction","leadership position","Observations Italy","risk","common practice","Conclusions","high amounts of conflict","emergency","urgent cases","wealthiest Italian region","appointments","hours","report","opportunities","epidemic","patients\u0027 well-being","coronavirus disease","article","acquisition of new skills","outpatient clinics","weeks","population","increase","Importance","bereavement","nurses","hospitals","physicians","leave","challenges","pandemic","crisis","interventions","inhabitants"],"language":"en"},

An \u03B1-L-fucosidase gene (PbFuc) from Pedobacter sp. CAU209 was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The deduced amino acid sequence shared the highest identity of 36.8% with the amino sequences of other reported \u03B1-L-fucosidases. The purified \u03B1-L-fucosidase (PbFuc) had a molecular mass of 50 kDa. The enzyme exhibited specific activity (26.3 U/mg) towards 4-nitrophenyl-\u03B1-L-fucopyranoside (pNP-FUC), 3\u0027FL (8.9 U/mg), and 2\u0027FL (3.4 U/mg). It showed the highest activity at pH 5.0 and 35 \u00B0C, respectively. PbFuc catalyzed the synthesis of 3\u0027FL and 2\u0027FL through a transglycosylation reaction using pNP-FUC as donor and lactose as acceptor, and total conversion ratio was up to 85% at the optimized reaction conditions.

On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On February 28, WHO increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at a global level. The COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health.Computed tomography (CT) has been an important imaging modality in assisting in the diagnosis and management of patients withCOVID-19. Some retrospective imaging studies have reported chest CT findings of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, suggesting that several CT findings may be characteristic. To our knowledge, there has been no prospective multicentre imaging study of COVID-19 to date.We proposed a hypothesis: There are some specific CT features on Chest CT of COVID-19 patients. And the mechanism of these CT features is explicable based on pathological findings. OBJECTIVE To investigate the specific CT features of COVID-19 and the formation mechanism of these CT features. METHOD This study is a prospective multicenter observational study. We will recruit 100 patients with COVID-19 at 55 hospitals. All patients undergo chest CT examination with the same scan protocol. The distribution and morphology of lesions on chest CT, clinical data will be recorded. A number of patients will be pathologically examined after permission is granted. The data of these three aspects will be analyzed synthetically. DISCUSSION This study will help us to identify the chest CT features of COVID-19 and its mechanism.

High transpulmonary driving pressure during laparoscopic surgery is associated with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.Intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure prevents atelectasis, but may also cause overdistension. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW This single-center study found that titrating intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure in relation to observed intraabdominal pressure may counterbalance pneumoperitoneum-related rises in transpulmonary driving pressure during laparoscopic cholecystectomies. BACKGROUND Pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgery is associated with a rise of driving pressure. The authors aimed to assess the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on driving pressure at varying intraabdominal pressure levels. It was hypothesized that PEEP attenuates pneumoperitoneum-related rises in driving pressure. METHODS Open-label, nonrandomized, crossover, clinical trial in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. \u0022Targeted PEEP\u0022 (2 cm H2O above intraabdominal pressure) was compared with \u0022standard PEEP\u0022 (5 cm H2O), with respect to the transpulmonary and respiratory system driving pressure at three predefined intraabdominal pressure levels, and each patient was ventilated with two levels of PEEP at the three intraabdominal pressure levels in the same sequence. The primary outcome was the difference in transpulmonary driving pressure between targeted PEEP and standard PEEP at the three levels of intraabdominal pressure. RESULTS Thirty patients were included and analyzed. Targeted PEEP was 10, 14, and 17 cm H2O at intraabdominal pressure of 8, 12, and 15 mmHg, respectively. Compared to standard PEEP, targeted PEEP resulted in lower median transpulmonary driving pressure at intraabdominal pressure of 8 mmHg (7 [5 to 8] vs. 9 [7 to 11] cm H2O; P = 0.010; difference 2 [95% CI 0.5 to 4 cm H2O]); 12 mmHg (7 [4 to 9] vs.10 [7 to 12] cm H2O; P = 0.002; difference 3 [1 to 5] cm H2O); and 15 mmHg (7 [6 to 9] vs.12 [8 to 15] cm H2O; P \u003C 0.001; difference 4 [2 to 6] cm H2O). The effects of targeted PEEP compared to standard PEEP on respiratory system driving pressure were comparable to the effects on transpulmonary driving pressure, though respiratory system driving pressure was higher than transpulmonary driving pressure at all intraabdominal pressure levels. CONCLUSIONS Transpulmonary driving pressure rises with an increase in intraabdominal pressure, an effect that can be counterbalanced by targeted PEEP. Future studies have to elucidate which combination of PEEP and intraabdominal pressure is best in term of clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazzinari, Guido; Diaz-Cambronero, Oscar; Alonso-I\u00F1igo, Jose Miguel; Garcia-Gregorio, Nuria; Ayas-Montero, Bego\u00F1a; Iba\u00F1ez, Jose Luis; Serpa Neto, Ary; Ball, Lorenzo; Gama de Abreu, Marcelo; Pelosi, Paolo; Maupoey, Javier; Argente Navarro, Maria Pilar; Schultz, Marcus J","journal":"Anesthesiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32011334/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["H2O; P","CI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of intraabdominal pressure","rise of driving pressure","increased intraabdominal pressure","predefined intraabdominal pressure levels","varying intraabdominal pressure levels","levels of PEEP","standard PEEP","H2O","effects of positive end-expiratory pressure","Intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure","effects of targeted PEEP","combination of PEEP","High transpulmonary","TOPIC Transpulmonary","CONCLUSIONS Transpulmonary","laparoscopic surgery","difference","mmHg","lower median transpulmonary","respiratory system compliance","laparoscopic cholecystectomy","laparoscopic cholecystectomies","pneumoperitoneum-related rises","BACKGROUND Pneumoperitoneum","patients","clinical trial","term of clinical outcomes","increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications","ratio of tidal volume","crossover","relation","atelectasis","single-center study","METHODS Open-label","respect","primary outcome","sequence","Future studies","CI","ARTICLE","overdistension","RESULTS","authors"],"language":"en"},

An array of pharmacological, psychological, physical, complementary, and rehabilitative interventions is available for CPMP, for which previous research has demonstrated varying effect sizes with regard to effectiveness in pain reduction and other main outcomes. This highlights the need for the synthesis of all available evidence. The proposed network meta-analysis will compare all available interventions for CPMP to determine the best treatment option(s) with a focus on efficacy and safety of interventions. METHODS We are interested in comparing interventions of the following types: psychological, pharmacological, physical, complementary, and rehabilitative interventions. We will include all randomized controlled trials that compare one intervention with another, or with a control group, in the treatment of CPMP. Primary efficacy outcomes will be pain intensity, emotional distress, and functional disability. Safety outcomes extracted will include proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events, unwanted events, or drop-out rates due to side effects. Published and unpublished trials will be sought through the search of all relevant databases and trial registries. At least two independent reviewers of the team will select the references and extract data independently. We will assess the risk of bias of each individual study using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We will conduct a network meta-analysis to synthesize all evidence for each outcome. We will fit our model primarily within a Bayesian framework. DISCUSSION CPMP is a disabling condition for which several interventions exist. To our knowledge, this is the first network meta-analysis to systematically compare all available evidence. This is required by national health institutions to inform their decisions about the best available treatment option(s) with regard to efficacy and safety outcomes.

METHODS Pregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020, and May 5, 2020, were identified. Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma. RESULTS Sixteen placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were examined (15 with live birth in the third trimester, 1 delivered in the second trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), particularly abnormal or injured maternal vessels, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased.The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. CONCLUSIONS Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of decidual arteriopathy and other features of MVM, a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia.

Here, we investigated the methodological quality of SRs on COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. METHODS Online searches were performed to obtain SRs on COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. The methodological quality of the included SRs was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. RESULTS In total, of 49 SRs that were finally included in our study, 17, 16, and 16 SRs were specifically on COVID-19, MERS, and SARS, respectively. The growth rate of SRs on COVID-19 was the highest (4.54/month) presently. Of the included SRs, 6, 12, and 31 SRs were of moderate, low, and critically low quality, respectively. SRs on SARS showed the optimum quality among the SRs on the three diseases. Subgroup analyses showed that the SR topic (P\u003C0.001), involvement of a methodologist (P\u003C0.001), and funding support (P=0.046) were significantly associated with the methodological quality of the SR. According to the adherence scores, adherence to AMSTAR-2 items sequentially decreased in SRs on SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The methodological quality of most SRs on coronavirus outbreaks is unsatisfactory, and those on COVID-19 have higher risks of poor quality, despite the rapid actions taken to conduct SRs. The quality of SRs should be improved in the future. Readers must exercise caution in accepting and using the results of these SRs. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods Between January 2005 and December 2015, data of 32 patients (16 males, 16 females; mean age 58.1\u00B110.9 years; range, 45 to 73 years) who were diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection and underwent repair with a history of previous cardiac surgery at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups as those with a history of prior coronary artery bypass grafting (n=16) and the patients with a previous cardiac surgery without prior coronary artery bypass grafting (n=16). Results Dissection of the ascending aorta occurred in 32 patients (late acute in 22 and late chronic in 10) who underwent previous cardiac surgery (aortic valve replacement in 12, mitral valve replacement in two, aortic valve replacement \u002B coronary artery bypass grafting in two, coronary artery bypass grafting in 10, mitral valve replacement \u002B coronary artery bypass grafting in four, and dual valve replacement in two patients). The mean time between the first operation and dissection was 4.0\u00B11.5 years. Dissections were treated with the Bentall procedures (n=8), ascending aorta replacement (n=14), ascending aorta replacement \u002B hemiarch replacement (n=4), ascending aorta \u002B aortic valve replacement (n=4) and Bentall \u002B arch replacement (n=2). In-hospital mortality (30-day mortality) was seen in five patients, and oneyear mortality rate was 21.85% (n=7). The survival rates of the all patients for primary cardiac surgery vs primary cardiac surgery \u002B coronary artery bypass grafting were 81.25% vs 75% at one year, 75% vs 68.75% at three years,75% vs 56.25% at five years, 68.75% vs 56.25% at seven years, and 68.75% vs 56.25% at 10 years, respectively (p=0.71, CI: 95%). Conclusion Type-A aortic dissections may develop after cardiac operations with or without coronary artery bypass grafting at any time, and irrespective of associated histologies, they may result in high overall in-hospital mortality. With careful planning by prompt intervention, the outcomes in redo sternotomy operations with or without coronary artery bypass grafting for aortic dissections would be consistent the results of spontaneous aortic dissections.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6z\u00E7\u0131nar, Evren; \u00C7ak\u0131c\u0131, Mehmet; Baran, \u00C7a\u011Fda\u015F; G\u00FCm\u00FC\u015F, Fatih; \u00D6zg\u00FCr, Alper; Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011Flu, Levent; Kaya, B\u00FClent; Akar, Ahmet R\u00FC\u00E7han","journal":"Turk gogus kalp damar cerrahisi dergisi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2018.14683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32082704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bentall"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aortic valve replacement","history of prior coronary artery bypass grafting","years","mitral valve replacement","ascending aorta replacement","dual valve replacement","primary cardiac surgery vs primary cardiac surgery","hemiarch replacement","outcomes of patients","cardiac operations","history of previous cardiac surgery","results of spontaneous aortic dissections","Results Dissection","results of late","hospital mortality","day mortality","acute type","oneyear mortality rate","mean time","Conclusion Type","mean age","Bentall procedures","redo sternotomy operations","repair","prompt intervention","onset","females","careful planning","high overall","range","institution","associated histologies","survival rates","data","groups","study","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Inpatient falls are the most commonly reported safety incident in the UK\u0027s National Health Service (NHS), costing the NHS \u00A3630 million a year. Injurious falls are particularly life-limiting and costly. There is a growing body of evidence on shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury prevention; however, no systematic review exists to inform practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically identify, appraise and summarise studies investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness, and experiences of shock-absorbing flooring in hospitals and care homes. Our search will build on an extensive search conducted by a scoping review (inception to May 2016). We will search electronic databases (AgeLine, CINAHL, MEDLINE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Scopus and Web of Science; May 2016-present), trial registries and grey literature. We will conduct backward and forward citation searches of included studies, and liaise with study researchers. We will evaluate the influence of floors on fall-related injuries, falls and staff work-related injuries through randomised and non-randomised studies, consider economic and qualitative evidence, and implementation factors. We will consider risk of bias, assess heterogeneity and explore potential effect modifiers via subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Where appropriate we will combine studies through meta-analysis. We will use the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach to evaluate the quality of evidence and present the results using summary of findings tables, and adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We will follow the ethical principles of systematic review conduct, by attending to publication ethics, transparency and rigour. Our dissemination plan includes peer-reviewed publication, presentations, press release, stakeholder symposium, patient video and targeted knowledge-to-action reports. This review will inform decision-making around falls management in care settings and identify important directions for future research.

Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. RESULTS The median at follow-up was 33.6 months. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) were 89%, 92%, and 53%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all survival end-points were correlated with the number of positive pelvic lymph nodes at oligorecurrence (\u2264 3 vs \u003E 3). Biochemical-PFS was correlated with PSA (p = 0.034) and PSA doubling time (p = 0.004) at oligorecurrence. At multivariate analysis, no independent variable was statistically significant. No patient experienced grade \u2265 2 late toxicity after radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS The number of metastatic lymph nodes and PSA doubling time seems to be important prognostic factors in the pelvic oligorecurrent setting. Salvage radiotherapy combined with short-course ADT might be a valid treatment strategy.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ingrosso, G; Mariucci, C; Tenti, M V; Bini, V; Al\u00EC, E; Saldi, S; Palumbo, I; Bellavita, R; Aristei, C","journal":"Clinical \u0026 translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12094-020-02364-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ENRT","Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events","PSA","ADT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Survival analysis","PCa patients","overall survival","survival end-points","cancer-specific survival","consecutive patients","PSA","salvage radiotherapy","Multivariate analysis","biochemical progression-free survival","pelvic nodal oligorecurrence","toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy","Biochemical-PFS","univariate analysis","pelvic oligorecurrent setting","oligorecurrent disease","oligorecurrent prostate cancer","number of positive pelvic lymph nodes","primary treatment","radiation therapy","late toxicity","time","biochemical recurrence","ENRT","number of metastatic lymph nodes","investigational treatment option","androgen deprivation therapy","valid treatment strategy","b-PFS","short-course ADT","oncologic outcome","Adverse Events","MDT","important prognostic factors","Common Terminology Criteria","Kaplan-Meier method","CTCAE","log-rank test","IMRT","Cox proportional hazards regression models","associations","CSS","positron emission tomography","Image-guided intensity","patient experienced grade","retrospective study","independent variable","CONCLUSIONS","combination","clinical parameters","PET","v4","PURPOSE Metastasis","years","median","follow-up","months","aim","METHODS","vs","tomotherapy"],"language":"en"},

Ex vivo high-resolution magic angle spinning proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HRMAS 1H MRS) is the most common technique for metabolic quantification in human surgical and biopsy tissue specimens. OBJECTIVE To perform a review of the current available literature on the clinical applications of HRMAS 1H MRS metabolic analysis in tissue samples of breast cancer patients. METHODS This systematic scoping review included original research papers published in the English language in peer-reviewed journals. Study selection was performed independently by two reviewers and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. RESULTS The literature search returned 159 studies and 26 papers were included as part of this systematic review. There was considerable variation regarding tissue type, aims, and statistical analysis methods across the different studies. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, the included studies were grouped according to their aims or main outcomes into: feasibility and tumor diagnosis (n = 6); tumor heterogeneity (n = 2); correlation with proteomics/transcriptomics (n = 3); correlation with prognostic factors (n = 11); and response evaluation to NAC (n = 4). CONCLUSION There is a lot of potential in including metabolic information of breast cancer tissue obtained with HRMAS 1H MRS. To date, studies show that metabolic concentrations quantified by this technique can be related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response in breast cancer patients.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bitencourt, Almir G V; Goldberg, Johanna; Pinker, Katja; Thakur, Sunitha B","journal":"Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11306-019-1611-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRMAS","NAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["included studies","metabolic information of breast cancer tissue","tissue samples of breast cancer patients","INTRODUCTION Breast cancer","different studies","H MRS metabolic analysis","metabolic quantification","tissue type","metabolic concentrations","treatment response","tumor diagnosis","systematic scoping review","systematic reviews","systemic treatment","biopsy tissue specimens","individualized diagnosis","correlation","aims","results","clinical applications of HRMAS","statistical analysis methods","personalized oncological treatment","different prognoses","common technique","response evaluation","literature search","tumor heterogeneity","original research papers","current available literature","proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy","heterogeneous disease","high-resolution magic angle","English language","meta-analyses","preferred reporting items","responses","feasibility","reviewers","PRISMA","date","new biomarkers","main outcomes","lot of potential","peer-reviewed journals","Ex","molecular characteristics","prognosis","guidelines","considerable variation","proteomics","transcriptomics","prognostic factors","NAC","CONCLUSION","interpretation","Study selection","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

This review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported till date. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on convalescent plasma on clinically relevant outcomes in individuals with COVID-19. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE and Medline databases were searched upto 19 April 2020. All records were screened as per the protocol eligibility criteria. RESULTS We included 5 studies reporting CPT to COVID-19 patients. The main findings from available data are as follows: (1) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients (2) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy (3) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma.

METHODS Our article comprehensively searched PubMed, FMRS, EMbase, CNKI,WanFang databases and VIP databases to collect literatures about the CT imaging features of COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and then, this meta-analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS 34 retrospective studies involving a total of 4 121 COVID-19 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that most patients presented bilateral lung involvement (73.8%, 95%CI: 65.9%-81.1%) or multilobar involvement (67.3%,95%CI: 54.8%-78.7 %) and just a little patients showed normal CT findings (8.4%). We found that the most common changes in lesion density was ground-glass opacities (68.1%,95%CI: 56.9%-78.2%). Other changes in density included air bronchogram sign(44.7%), crazy-paving pattern (35.6%) and consolidation (32.0%). Patchy (40.3%), spider web sign (39.5%), cord-like (36.8%) and nodular (20.5%) were common lesion shapes in COVID-19 patients. Pleural thickening (27.1%) was found in some patients. Lymphadenopathy(5.4%) and pleural effusion (5.3%) were rare. CONCLUSION The lung lesions of patients with COVID-19 were mostly bilateral lungs or multilobar involved. The most common chest CT findings were patchy and ground-glass opacities. Some patients had air bronchogram, spider web sign and cord-like. Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were rare.

We explored the efficacy and safety of \u2265 12-month DAPT among MMACS patients. METHODS In this sub-analysis of the optimal antiplatelet therapy for Chinese Patients with Coronary Artery Disease study (NCT01735305), clinical outcomes among MMACS patients were compared between the \u003C 12-month and \u2265 12-month DAPT groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Safety endpoints included the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 2-5, BARC 3-5, and all bleeding events. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare baseline characteristics between the \u003C 12-month and \u2265 12-month DAPT groups. RESULTS In this cohort of ACS patients (n = 10,016), MMACS patients (n = 2967) were less likely to use DAPT at 12 (31.64% vs. 67.47%, P \u003C 0.0001) and 24 (13.82% vs. 18.71%, P \u003C 0.0001) months and experienced more ischemic events at 12 (4.55% vs. 3.40%, P = 0.006) and 24 (6.88% vs. 5.08%, P = 0.0004) months than those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 7049). Among MMACS patients, the rate of primary efficacy endpoint occurring within the second year was significantly higher in the \u003C 12-month DAPT group than in the \u2265 12-month group both before (2.88% vs. 1.60%, P = 0.040) and after (3.19% vs. 1.71%, P = 0.045) PSM. After PSM, no significant differences in all bleeding, BARC 2-5, and BARC 3-5 bleeding were found between the groups. CONCLUSION MMACS patients with insufficient DAPT management experienced relatively more ischemic events. DAPT for at least 1 year may be beneficial to this special population without significantly increasing the bleeding risks.

Social distancing measures were introduced in the UK in March 2020 and virtual consultations (via telephone or video call) were identified as a potential alternative to face-to-face consultations at this time. LOCAL PROBLEM The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) sees on average 11 200 face-to-face consultations a month. On average 7% of these are delivered virtually via telephone. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the RNOH set a target of reducing face-to-face consultations to 20% of all outpatient attendances. This report outlines a quality improvement initiative to rapidly implement virtual consultations at the RNOH. METHODS The COVID-19 Action Team, a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals, was assembled to support the implementation of virtual clinics. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement approach to quality improvement was followed using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. A process of enablement, process redesign, delivery support and evaluation were carried out, underpinned by Improvement principles. RESULTS Following the target of 80% virtual consultations being set, 87% of consultations were delivered virtually during the first 6 weeks. Satisfaction scores were high for virtual consultations (90/100 for patients and 78/100 for clinicians); however, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, video consultations would be preferred less than 50% of the time. Information to support the future redesign of outpatient services was collected. CONCLUSIONS This report demonstrates that virtual consultations can be rapidly implemented in response to COVID-19 and that they are largely acceptable. Further initiatives are required to support clinically appropriate and acceptable virtual consultations beyond COVID-19.

The objective was to examine type III, IV, and VI collagens turnovers in SSc and investigate longitudinal alterations in relation to modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). We included patients fulfilling the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria for SSc (limited cutaneous [lcSSc, n = 20], diffuse cutaneous SSc [dcSSc, n = 23]) and healthy controls (HC, n = 10). Biomarkers of type III, IV, and VI collagens formation (PRO-C3, PRO-C4, PRO-C6) and degradation (C3M, C4M, C6M) were measured in serum. The fibrotic index of the individual collagens (FICol) were calculated.

Methods: This study covered the period from January 14 to March 1, 2020. From February 24 on, the supine position method and the protective face screen were used to collect nasopharyngeal swabs, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by sitting position method. All the patients were diagnosed with suspected/confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, who were admitted from February 19 on, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected outside the hospital. (1) Thirty-four operators meeting the inclusion criteria of the study were recruited in this retrospective cohort study. They were grouped according to the collection method of nasopharyngeal swabs. Sixteen operators of Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who used the supine position method and the protective face screen were included in supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen group (15 males and 1 female, aged 34-49 years); 18 operators (12 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University), 1 from Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital, 5 from the East District of People\u0027s Hospital of Wuhan University) who used the traditional sitting position method were included in sitting position method group (2 males and 16 females, aged 25-49 years). In supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen group, when collecting sample, the patient lay flat and wore a special protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with neck slightly extending and face turning to the opposite side of the operator about 10\u00B0. The self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the cooperation, the incidence of nausea, coughing, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, the operation time of single sampling, the fear of operation and the perceived exposure risk of operators of the two groups. (2) Sixty-five patients (22 males and 43 females, aged 25-91 years) admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who successively received the sitting position method and supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen for nasopharyngeal swabs sampling and with complete nucleic acid detection results were included. The positive rates of nucleic acid detection by the two sampling methods of nasopharyngeal swabs of the patients were statistically analyzed. (3) Forty-one patients who could express their feelings accurately were selected from the above 65 patients (12 males and 29 females, aged 27-83 years). The comfort of patients in the process of sampling by the two methods was investigated. (4) Thirty-four patients (10 males and 24 females, aged 25-83 years) with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method were selected from the above 65 patients. The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swab of patients by supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen, i.e. negative to positive rate was statistically analyzed. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon\u0027s sign rank test, t test, and chi-square test. Results: (1) The cooperation score of patients evaluated by the operators in supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen group was significantly higher than that in sitting position method group (Z=-4.928, P\u003C0.01), the incidence of nausea, choking cough, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, and the fear of operation score and the perceived exposure risk score of operators were significantly lower than those of sitting position method group (Z=-5.071, -5.046, -4.095, -4.397, -4.174, -5.049, P\u003C0.01), and the operation time of single sampling was significantly longer than that of sitting position method group (t=23.17, P\u003C0.01). (2) The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen was 60.00% (39/65), which was obviously higher than 41.54% (27/65) by sitting position method (\u03C7(2)=4.432, P\u003C0.05). (3) The comfort score of the 41 patients during nasopharyngeal swabs sampling by supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen was significantly higher than that by sitting position method (Z=-5.319, P\u003C0.01). (4) Of the 34 patients with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method, the rate of negative to positive of nucleic acid detection was 26.47% (9/34) after sampling by supine position method\u002Bprotective face screen. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional sitting position method, detection of 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acids of nasopharyngeal swabs collected by supine method combined with protective face screen is worth promoting, because of its better comfort of patients, low exposure risk for operators, in addition to reducing in the false negative result to some extent, which may help reduce false recurrence of discharged patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, S Y; Luo, Y M; Hu, T Y; You, Z C; Sun, J G; Yu, S Y; Yuan, Z Q; Peng, Y Z; Luo, G X; Xu, Z","journal":"Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20200312-00153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["First Affiliated Hospital","the Third Military Medical University","Army Medical University","Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["supine position method","sitting position method group","traditional sitting position method","collection method of nasopharyngeal swabs","protective face screen group","nasopharyngeal swabs sampling","sampling methods of nasopharyngeal swabs","special protective face screen","comfort of patients","positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swab of patients","cooperation score of patients","years","consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs","operators of Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital","process of sampling","females","novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection","complete nucleic acid detection results","positive rates of nucleic acid detection","operation time of single sampling","perceived exposure risk of operators","clinical application effect of modified nasopharyngeal swab sampling","perceived exposure risk score of operators","fear of operation score","East District of People\u0027s Hospital of Wuhan University","Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University","Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital","t test","Military Medical University","chi-square test","incidence of nausea","sneezing","retrospective cohort study","novel coronavirus infection","Wilcoxon\u0027s sign rank test","sample","neck","cough","inclusion criteria","self-designed questionnaire","Data","Objective","period","groups","feelings","supine method","protective face screen","positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs","positive of nucleic acid detection","novel coronavirus nucleic acids of nasopharyngeal swabs","rate of negative","better comfort of patients","false negative result","false recurrence of discharged patients","comfort score","low exposure risk","operators","addition","extent","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

In this paper were investigated the physiological traits of two populations of Dictyota dichotoma var. intricata, living at two different pH for several generations to assess the reasons of the algae reduced abundance at current (8.1) compared to low pH (6.7). Besides, through transplant experiments, the two populations were analysed for the stress response and reversibility of physiological performance at different pH. The long-term acclimation to high pCO2/low pH favours an ecotype characterised by low energetic costs, higher photochemical efficiency and more resistance to the oxidative stress, compared to individuals living at current pH. These traits promoted the growth and reproduction of the community living at pH 6.7, favouring a lower macroalgal diversity, but a higher ecological success under ocean acidification. The similar behaviour observed between Dictyota living at pH 6.7 and transplanted thalli from pH 6.7 to 8.1, suggested a high tolerance to pH changes in the short-term. On the contrary, adaptive responses may have favoured molecular adjustments on the long-term, as showed by the significant differences between the wild populations at pH 8.1 and 6.7. The overall data indicate that both plasticity and adaptive mechanisms may be the reasons for the success of the brown seaweeds under future high pCO2/low pH. The plasticity due to photochemistry adjustments is likely involved in the early response to environmental changes. Conversely, modifications in the photosynthetic biochemical machinery suggest that more complex adaptive mechanisms occurred in the current population of Dictyota living at pH 6.7. Further studies on population genetics will reveal if any differentiation is taking place at the population level or a local adaptation has already occurred in Dictyota and other brown algae under chronic low pH.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porzio, Lucia; Arena, Carmen; Lorenti, Maurizio; De Maio, Anna; Buia, Maria Cristina","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current pH","pH changes","different pH","chronic low pH","current population of Dictyota","populations of Dictyota dichotoma","low energetic costs","future high pCO2","complex adaptive mechanisms","brown algae","adaptive responses","high tolerance","population level","wild populations","physiological traits","stress response","population genetics","ocean acidification","reasons","plasticity","higher ecological success","macroalgal communities","brown seaweeds","oxidative stress","early response","long-term acclimation","molecular adjustments","environmental changes","photochemistry adjustments","higher photochemical efficiency","reversibility of physiological performance","lower macroalgal diversity","shallowest coastal habitats","ecotype","photosynthetic biochemical machinery","resistance","intricata","differentiation","local adaptation","significant differences","reproduction","individuals","transplanted thalli","functional roles","modifications","growth","place","community","abundance","generations","overall data","similar behaviour","transplant experiments","studies","paper"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a multicentre, observational, nationwide survey to collect data on admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at Italian CCUs throughout a 1 week period during the COVID-19 outbreak, compared with the equivalent week in 2019. We observed a 48.4% reduction in admissions for AMI compared with the equivalent week in 2019 (P \u003C 0.001). The reduction was significant for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI; 26.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 21.7-32.3; P = 0.009] and non-STEMI (NSTEMI; 65.1%, 95% CI 60.3-70.3; P \u003C 0.001). Among STEMIs, the reduction was higher for women (41.2%; P = 0.011) than men (17.8%; P = 0.191). A similar reduction in AMI admissions was registered in North Italy (52.1%), Central Italy (59.3%), and South Italy (52.1%).

At the same time, the rate of disease progression, fever, CT manifestations, hypoxia degree, age, basic diseases, and laboratory indicators can also be used to evaluate the severity of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, L; Liu, H G","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of novel coronavirus","early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia","Fever","early stage","hypoxia degree","CT manifestations","characteristics of rapid transmission","basic diseases","atypical clinical symptoms","rate of disease progression","dyspnea","myalgia","weakness","imagings","cough","assessment","nCoV","laboratory indicators","Wuhan","China","time","severity","attention","lungs","misdiagnosis"],"language":"en"},

This is achieved through teaching, whereby planned strategies, based on principles of how people learn, enable learning. Despite Learning Principles being the fundamental tenets of the learning process, how HPs perceive and use Learning Principles in their practice is neglected in the healthcare literature. Objective To identify, describe and map the existing literature on nurses\u0027 and HPs\u0027 perceptions and use of Learning Principles in parent education practice. Method A scoping review was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach. A comprehensive search of 10 databases and the grey literature was undertaken between March and June 2017 to identify pertinent English-language publications. The search was limited to literature published between 1998 and 2017. Following a screening and inclusion criteria eligibility check, 89 articles were selected for inclusion. Results HPs\u0027 perceptions of Learning Principles were diverse, somewhat disorganised, divergent in meaning and implicit. This was until the Dimensions of Learning construct was applied to guide the analyses and mapping. This revealed that HPs, of whom 60.7% were nurses, used Learning Principles in parent education, but only referred to them in the context of Adult Learning. Enablers to HPs using Learning Principles included shared partnerships between parents and HPs, while barriers included parents\u0027 health beliefs, psychological issues and organisational assumptions about learning. Evaluation of parents\u0027 learning also represented implicit use of Learning Principles by HPs. Conclusion This scoping review is the first to examine HPs\u0027 perceptions and use of Learning Principles within parent education practice. The findings reveal a significant gap in this body of knowledge. The paucity of studies containing any explicit descriptions of Learning Principles strongly supports the need for further exploration and codification of Learning Principles, through qualitative methods, whereby a deeper understanding of what is happening in healthcare practice can be established.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Deryn; Leach, Matthew; Smith, Colleen; Fereday, Jennifer; May, Esther","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Health Professionals","Adult Learning"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["codification of Learning Principles","learning process","implicit use of Learning Principles","explicit descriptions of Learning Principles","Results HPs\u0027 perceptions of Learning Principles","Evaluation of parents\u0027 learning","Dimensions of Learning construct","context of Adult Learning","parent education practice","healthcare practice","healthcare literature","parents\u0027 knowledge","existing literature","grey literature","parents\u0027 health beliefs","scoping review","body of knowledge","comprehensive search","Background Health Professionals","inclusion criteria eligibility check","psychological issues","barriers","shared partnerships","organisational assumptions","qualitative methods","articles","skills development","fundamental tenets","significant gap","screening","databases","nurses\u0027","need","exploration","Joanna Briggs Institute approach","deeper understanding","paucity of studies","important role","pertinent English-language publications","planned strategies","children","Enablers","analyses","teaching","findings","people","mapping","Conclusion","Objective"],"language":"en"},

The three most important events of the end of the 19th century, i.e., the introduction of anesthesia, the use of artery forceps and ligation of blood vessels, as well as prophylactic management of perioperative infections decidedly affected the improvement of therapeutic results of thyroid surgery. Surgical treatment of thyroid diseases is associated with the possibility of complications developing, of which bleeding is among the most serious ones, starting from the need for an immediate reoperation and ending at a considerable damage to functionally important structures: the laryngeal nerves and parathyroid glands. The consensus reached between the development of science and progress in modern technologies has provided the basis for introducing and popularizing minimally invasive procedures, including operations using the approach through natural body openings. Such an unprecedented development of surgical techniques would not be possible without devices for closing blood vessels. Given the mechanism of hemostasis, current vascular sealing devices can generally be divided into three groups: ultrasonic, bipolar-radiofrequency and hybrid systems combining both energy modalities. While analyzing the innovative, advanced technology of all the energy-based devices, it should be stated that only if they are used in a safe manner, quality of life of patients with various thyroid conditions is improved. The employment of such devices fully confirms their usefulness; nevertheless, all the advantages should never release the surgeon from the obligation to appropriately and safely identify the surrounding structures and let him uncritically use the new device.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konturek, Aleksander; Szpyra, Bart\u0142omiej; Stopa-Barczy\u0144ska, Ma\u0142gorzata; Barczy\u0144ski, Marcin","journal":"Gland surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/gs.2019.10.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32175256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["energy-based devices","improvement of therapeutic results of thyroid surgery","various thyroid conditions","Surgical treatment of thyroid diseases","important structures","current vascular sealing devices","unprecedented development of surgical techniques","ligation of blood vessels","development of science","energy modalities","important events","surrounding structures","use of artery forceps","evolution of operative techniques","quality of life","patients","bipolar-radiofrequency","hybrid systems","operations","approach","laryngeal nerves","modern technologies","prophylactic management of perioperative infections","mechanism of hemostasis","considerable damage","sui generis revolution","need","progress","turn","place","natural body openings","immediate reoperation","safe manner","parathyroid glands","advanced technology","introduction of anesthesia","bleeding","serious ones","invasive procedures","basis","groups","end","decades","possibility of complications","surgeon","advantages","century","past","consensus","usefulness","new device","obligation","centuries","employment"],"language":"en"},

Driven by legislative enactments to improve access to care, the PA has emerged as a ready and able medical professional to address workforce shortages. The aim of this study was to review the literature on patient satisfaction of PAs. OBJECTIVES The basis for this review was to clarify working definitions, synthesize the evidence, and establish conceptual boundaries around the topic of patient satisfaction with PAs. The intent was to identify gaps in the literature and offer suggested undertakings for more clarification on the subject. METHODS A scoping review was undertaken. Literature from 1968 to 2019 was searched and filtered for eligibility. Those that met criteria were categorized by date, method, geography, themes, and design. RESULTS In total, there were 987 papers or reports that were identified through bibliography database searching. Additional articles found through snowball methodology-reviewing references (n = 11). Only English language articles emerged for analysis. From this effort, 25 articles surfaced from the filtering process for final inclusion. Most (72%) of the articles came from the United States of America, three from the United Kingdom, and one each from Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Most articles were descriptive in nature. Some variations in methods emerged. CONCLUSION PAs are operational in 15 nations; their acceptance appears successful and satisfaction with their care largely indistinguishable from physicians. Findings from this analysis highlight one theory that when patient\u0027s needs are met, satisfaction is high regardless of the medical provider. Areas for further research are identified.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hooker, Roderick S; Moloney-Johns, Amanda J; McFarland, Mary M","journal":"Human resources for health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-019-0428-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31881896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA"],"locations":["United States","United Kingdom","Netherlands","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["patient satisfaction of PAs","topic of patient satisfaction","level of patient satisfaction","Additional articles","literature","CONCLUSION PAs","English language articles","care","analysis","scoping review","METHODS","medical provider","United Kingdom","able medical professional","United States of America","nations","snowball methodology","conceptual boundaries","role","associate","date","geography","themes","evidence","access","theory","workforce shortages","suggested undertakings","filtering process","acceptance","patient\u0027s needs","physician assistant","reports","Netherlands","Ireland","clarification","final inclusion","references","legislative enactments","gaps","working definitions","bibliography database searching","New Zealand","total","papers","subject","BACKGROUND","design","criteria","question","Findings","physicians","study","OBJECTIVES","basis","nature","Areas","research","RESULTS","aim","intent","variations"],"language":"en"},

Applying this anatomical repair concept to the treatment of other abdominal wall hernias, we developed an endoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach (TEA) to treat primary midline ventral hernias, including umbilical and epigastric hernias, in which for mesh placement, an anatomical space is developed between the peritoneum and the posterior rectus sheath in the ventral part of the abdominal wall (preperitoneal space). METHODS Between September 2017 and December 2019 according to the selection criterions, 28 consecutive primary midline ventral hernias were repaired using TEA. After extensive endoscopic development of the midline extraperitoneal plane, which was started in the suprasymphysic area, and reduction of the hernia sac, the hernia defect was closed and a large mesh was placed in the preperitoneal position to enforce the anterior abdominal wall. RESULTS All operations were successfully performed without conversion to open surgery. The mean operation time was 103.3 min (range 85-145 min). Patient-reported postoperative pain was qualitatively mild with a mean pain visual analogue scale score of 1.9 on postoperative day 1. The average hospital stay was 1.9 days (range 1-3 days). Three patients developed minor complications and were treated with no long-term adverse effects. Readmissions within 30 days or hernia recurrences were not observed with a mean follow-up period of 18 months (range 10-27 months). CONCLUSION In selected cases, TEA is a safe and feasible minimally invasive alternative in treating primary ventral hernias. This technique preserves the anatomical and physiological structure of the abdominal wall and may significantly reduce trauma and postoperative complications. Additionally, anti-adhesion-coated meshes and fixation tackers are not required, thus being cost-effective. Further studies are necessary to proof the true clinical efficacy in comparison to well-known alternative techniques.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Binggen; Qin, Changfu; Bittner, Reinhard","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07575-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["abdominal wall hernias","primary ventral hernias","epigastric hernias","consecutive primary midline ventral hernias","TEA","treatment of inguinal hernias","anterior abdominal wall","range","days","postoperative pain","anatomical space","postoperative complications","midline extraperitoneal plane","hernia defect","hernia sac","hernia recurrences","extraperitoneal approach","preperitoneal space","months","postoperative day","mean follow-up period","mean operation time","anatomical repair concept","invasive alternative","mean pain visual analogue scale score","large mesh","mesh placement","preperitoneal position","minor complications","well-known alternative techniques","extensive endoscopic development","true clinical efficacy","comparison","peritoneum","physiological structure","selection criterions","reduction","selected cases","posterior rectus sheath","trauma","average hospital stay","conversion","CONCLUSION","Readmissions","anti-adhesion","fixation tackers","suprasymphysic area","long-term adverse effects","open surgery","studies","patients","TEP","operations","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The problem with vaccination is the time it takes to develop an effective vaccine, validate its safety and manufacture it in large quantities. Facing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we simply do not have the time to develop the vaccine before thousands of people die. Therefore, any treatment which can decrease the severe symptoms due to lung damage may help attenuate mortality rates. Inactivation of ACE2 during virus fusion into the host cell may be one of the underlying reasons for intense immunological reaction seen in the lung tissue. This overreaction is probably mediated through the bradykinin receptor activation. Noscapine, a medication used for the treatment of cough, has been shown to inhibit bradykinin enhanced cough response in man.

This study aimed to assess whether aminophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, improves early graft function and reduces incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) and slow graft function (SGF). METHODS Single center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. Pediatric patients admitted for renal transplantation from donation after brain death donors were randomized into a treatment arm receiving aminophylline and a placebo arm receiving normal saline infusions. Primary outcome was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 5 days post-transplant. Secondary outcomes were rates of DGF/SGF and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels. RESULTS Twenty-three patients were randomized to aminophylline and 27 to placebo. There was no difference in day 5 eGFR, rate of DGF/SGF, or urine NGAL/Creatinine level between aminophylline vs. placebo arm (eGFR 67.39 \u00B1 38.9 ml/min/1.73m2 vs. 80.48 \u00B1 52.1 ml/min/1.73m2p = 0.32; DGF/SGF 5/23 (21.7%) vs. 3/27 (11.1%) p = 0.31; urine NGAL/creatinine 300.5 ng/mg IQR 105.5-1464.5 ng/mg vs. 425.4 ng/mg IQR 140.3-1126.2 ng/mg, p = 0.95; respectively). At 12 months, there was 100% patient survival and 98% graft survival. eGFR at 12 months was similar between the two arms. CONCLUSIONS There was no benefit in peri-transplant aminophylline administration. Our results are limited by small sample size, since sample calculations were based on primary outcome of day 5 eGFR and low rate of DGF/SGF, which may have precluded us from demonstrating efficacy. Further clinical studies are necessary to determine any benefit of aminophylline in kidney transplant recipients, particularly from high-risk donors.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haskin, Orly; Shih, Weiwen; Wong, Cynthia J; Axelrod, David M; Grimm, Paul C","journal":"Pediatric nephrology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-020-04561-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418145/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DGF/SGF","NGAL/Creatinine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eGFR","SGF","benefit of aminophylline","placebo arm","low rate of DGF","rates of DGF","graft survival","peri-transplant aminophylline administration","early graft function","slow graft function","kidney transplantation","urine NGAL","kidney transplant recipients","incidence of delayed graft function","transplanted kidney","treatment arm","primary outcome of day","RESULTS","IQR","randomized clinical trial","months","glomerular filtration rate","days post-transplant","renal transplantation","sample calculations","Creatinine level","high-risk donors","patient survival","clinical studies","Pediatric patients","adenosine receptor antagonist","small sample size","brain death donors","urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin","donation","double-blinded","ischemia reperfusion injury","METHODS Single center","normal saline infusions","Secondary outcomes","levels","BACKGROUND","difference","major mediator","arms","CONCLUSIONS","study","73m2","efficacy"],"language":"en"},

A total of 360 1-day-old male broilers were randomly divided into three groups containing six replicates with 20 broilers per replicate. The negative control (NC) group and the positive control (PC) group were given non-GM maize and non-GM maize plus exogenous vitamin E (VE), respectively, and the VER group was given VER replacing the non-GM maize given to the NC group. Between days 1 and 21 and days 22 and 42, VE levels were 4.38 and 4.63 mg kg-1 in the NC group, and 14.11 and 14.91 mg kg-1 in the PC and VER group, respectively.

The IBV S-ectodomain protein, which is S excluding the transmembrane anchor and short cytoplasmic domain of S2, expressed from recombinant LS corresponds to an Arkansas (Ark)-type IBV. In a first experiment, chickens were primed at 1 day of age or primed at 1 day of age and boosted at 14 days of age with 104 50% embryo infectious doses (EID50)/bird of rLS/IBV.Se and challenged with a virulent Ark strain. A single vaccination proved completely ineffective at protecting chickens against challenge, whereas priming and boosting reduced clinical signs and tracheal lesions but did not reduce viral load in lachrymal fluids. In experiment 2, the vaccine dose was increased to 107 EID50/bird and a different virulent Ark strain was used for challenge. In addition, chickens were singly immunized on either day 1 or day 10 after hatch. NDV antibody levels detected in vaccinated chickens were moderate, with hemagglutination inhibition titers varying between 4 and 5 log2. Slightly higher antibody levels to NDV were observed in chickens vaccinated on day 10 versus day 1 but without the difference achieving statistical significance. In contrast, antibody responses measured using recombinant IBV S1 protein-coated ELISA plates were significantly greater in chickens vaccinated on day 10 than on day 1. The use of a higher rLS/IBV.Se dose substantially enhanced the success of a single vaccination compared to experiment 1. Signs and tracheal lesions were reduced more effectively in chickens vaccinated at day 10 after hatch. However, as in experiment 1, vaccination did not reduce the viral loads in tear fluids of challenged chickens. Similar results, in which no reduction in viral load in the trachea was apparent from rLS/IBV.S vaccination, have been obtained by others. Further work is needed to understand the immune responses induced by this recombinant virus that seems to provide some protection against the disease but does not reduce viral loads in the upper respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zegpi, R A; He, L; Yu, Q; Joiner, K S; van Santen, V L; Toro, H","journal":"Avian diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.1.53; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267125/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombinant Newcastle","IBV","LS","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV challenge","vaccinated chickens","day of age","type IBV","IBV S-ectodomain protein","S vaccination","experiment","recombinant virus","tear fluids of challenged chickens","viral loads","bird of rLS","recombinant LS","higher rLS","Se dose","single vaccination","recombinant IBV S1 protein-coated ELISA plates","NDV antibody levels","Recombinant Newcastle disease virus","antibody responses","higher antibody levels","infectious bronchitis virus","EID50","different virulent Ark strain","tracheal lesions","days of age","protection","hatch","reduced clinical signs","immune responses","lachrymal fluids","vaccine dose","embryo infectious doses","LaSota","short cytoplasmic domain of S2","transmembrane anchor","secreted trimeric spike","reduction","Arkansas","hemagglutination inhibition titers","upper respiratory tract","success","difference","contrast","use","statistical significance","Similar results","log2","work","addition"],"language":"en"},

An optimal threshold of blood eosinophil count for prescribing ICS has not been agreed. Doubt has been cast on the role by observational studies. The role of inhaled corticosteroids in this relationship, independent of long-acting bronchodilators, has not been examined. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of post-hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies examining three blood eosinophil thresholds and the independent role of ICS. Included studies were categorised by the form (relative or absolute count) and cut point of eosinophil threshold used. Thresholds assessed were relative eosinophil count of 2%, and absolute counts of 150 cells/\u03BCL and 300 cells/\u03BCL. Three meta-analyses of the effect of ICS use in post-hoc analyses of RCTs based on these counts were carried out. Initial analysis included all studies of ICS vs. any non-ICS regimen. Further analysis examined the effect of ICS, independent of the effect of long-acting bronchodilators. RESULTS Sixteen studies examined the association between blood eosinophil count and response of exacerbation risk to ICS, in COPD patients. Eleven studies (25,881 patients) were post-hoc analyses of RCTs. Five studies (109,704 patients) were retrospective observational studies. The independent effect of ICS on the reduction of exacerbation risk was 20% at \u22652% blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85), 35% at \u2265150 cells/\u03BCL blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.65; 0.52-0.79), and 39% at \u2265300 cells/\u03BCL blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.61; 0.44-0.78). No association was found in four out of five observational studies. CONCLUSION This is the first systematic review to assess, in post-hoc analyses of RCTs, the independent effect of ICS in reducing the risk of COPD exacerbation across a range of blood eosinophil thresholds. Association between ICS prescription and reduced exacerbation risk at these thresholds was confirmed. The lack of association found in the observational studies questions the relevance of these observations to a \u0022real world\u0022 COPD population. To clarify the clinical utility of this biomarker, the association should be tested in prospective effectiveness studies.","publish_time":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harries, Timothy H; Rowland, Victoria; Corrigan, Christopher J; Marshall, Iain J; McDonnell, Lucy; Prasad, Vibhore; Schofield, Peter; Armstrong, David; White, Patrick","journal":"Respiratory research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1268-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31900184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","ICS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["studies of ICS","independent effect of ICS","\u03BCL blood eosinophil threshold","independent role of ICS","ICS prescription","prescribing ICS","BACKGROUND Blood eosinophil count","optimal threshold of blood eosinophil count","range of blood eosinophil thresholds","effect of ICS use","relative eosinophil count","retrospective observational studies","point of eosinophil threshold","analyses of RCTs","non-ICS regimen","prospective effectiveness studies","risk of COPD exacerbation","cells","COPD patients","response of exacerbation risk","reduced exacerbation risk","reduction of exacerbation risk","meta-analyses","RR","lack of association","systematic review of post-","COPD population","analyses of randomised controlled trials","role of inhaled corticosteroids","absolute counts","acting bronchodilators","prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD","predictor of response","Initial analysis","relationship","real world","observations","form","biomarker","relevance","clinical utility","METHODS","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Doubt"],"language":"en"},

Liver heterogeneity and sampling variability can affect the reliability of results. This study aimed to compare histological variability of intraoperative wedge and core liver biopsies from different lobes in bariatric patients, to better inform surgeons on biopsy method and guide interpretation of results. METHODS We prospectively recruited bariatric surgical patients. Intraoperative core biopsies were taken from the left and right lobe, with a wedge biopsy taken from the left. All biopsies were graded by a specialist liver pathologist, blinded to clinical details and biopsy site. Concordance of histological findings between sites was evaluated. RESULTS There were 91 participants (72.2% female), mean age 46.8 \u00B1 12.0 years, body mass index 45.9 \u00B1 9.4 kg/m2. There was no significant pattern for up- or down-grading disease dependent on biopsy technique. Moderate to strong agreement was seen in the presence of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, \u03BA = 0.609-0.865, p \u003C 0.001) between biopsy sites. Individual components (steatosis, inflammation, ballooning) showed weaker agreement (\u03BA = 0.386-0.656, p \u003C 0.01). Fibrosis showed particularly poor agreement (\u03BA = 0.223-0.496, p \u003C 0.01). Detection of pathology improved with a combination of biopsy techniques, compared to a single biopsy method. CONCLUSION Overall diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH shows good agreement between biopsy sites, but individual components, particularly fibrosis stage, vary significantly. Clinicians should consider biopsies from varied sites, to better assess liver disease severity. These data have important implications in fibrosis assessment of NAFLD and are relevant in the interpretation of histological efficacy of investigational pharmacotherapies.

This paper describes the impact of sedentarism on the human body at the level of the muscular, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine and nervous systems and is based on evidence from several models of inactivity, including bed rest, unilateral limb suspension, and step-reduction. Data form these studies show that muscle wasting occurs rapidly, being detectable within two days of inactivity. This loss of muscle mass is associated with fibre denervation, neuromuscular junction damage and upregulation of protein breakdown, but is mostly explained by the suppression of muscle protein synthesis. Inactivity also affects glucose homeostasis as just few days of step reduction or bed rest, reduce insulin sensitivity, principally in muscle. Additionally, aerobic capacity is impaired at all levels of the O2 cascade, from the cardiovascular system, including peripheral circulation, to skeletal muscle oxidative function. Positive energy balance during physical inactivity is associated with fat deposition, associated with systemic inflammation and activation of antioxidant defences, exacerbating muscle loss. Importantly, these deleterious effects of inactivity can be diminished by routine exercise practice, but the exercise dose-response relationship is currently unknown. Nevertheless, low to medium-intensity high volume resistive exercise, easily implementable in home-settings, will have positive effects, particularly if combined with a 15-25% reduction in daily energy intake. This combined regimen seems ideal for preserving neuromuscular, metabolic and cardiovascular health.Highlights This paper describes the impact of sedentarism, caused by the COVID-19 home confinement on the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine systems.Just few days of sedentary lifestyle are sufficient to induce muscle loss, neuromuscular junction damage and fibre denervation, insulin resistance, decreased aerobic capacity, fat deposition and low-grade systemic inflammation.Regular low/medium intensity high volume exercise, together with a 15-25% reduction in caloric intake are recommended for preserving neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine health.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narici, Marco; De Vito, Giuseppe; Franchi, Martino; Paoli, Antonio; Moro, Tatiana; Marcolin, Giuseppe; Grassi, Bruno; Baldassarre, Giovanni; Zuccarelli, Lucrezia; Biolo, Gianni; di Girolamo, Filippo Giorgio; Fiotti, Nicola; Dela, Flemming; Greenhaff, Paul; Maganaris, Constantinos","journal":"European journal of sport science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2020.1761076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["muscle loss","cardiovascular health","days of inactivity","loss of muscle mass","endocrine health","neuromuscular junction damage","cardiovascular system","physical inactivity","days of step reduction","models of inactivity","step-reduction","suppression of muscle protein synthesis","deleterious effects of inactivity","endocrine systems","skeletal muscle oxidative function","home-confinement","home confinement","medium intensity high volume exercise","medium-intensity high volume resistive exercise","fibre denervation","bed rest","fat deposition","routine exercise practice","unprecedented health crisis","aerobic capacity","home-settings","significant health risks","impact of sedentarism","paper","positive effects","COVID","exercise dose-response relationship","low-grade systemic inflammation","days of sedentary lifestyle","Positive energy balance","daily energy intake","Regular low","insulin resistance","insulin sensitivity","nervous systems","caloric intake","combined regimen","upregulation of protein breakdown","peripheral circulation","unilateral limb suspension","entire populations","activation of antioxidant defences","human body","physiological challenge","levels","O2 cascade","pandemic","evidence","glucose homeostasis","weeks","months","Data","studies"],"language":"en"},

However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called \u0022knowns\u0022, and there are more we do not know called \u0022unknowns\u0022. Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently, it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype-based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to \u0022open\u0022 the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speeds up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Yu; Shi, Yemin; Wang, Yaowei; Huang, Tiejun; Tian, Yonghong","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63649-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new categories","unknowns","open set recognition tasks","open set problem","new category","weights of new predictors","closed set recognition methods","Open Deep Network","P-ODN","closed set scenarios","existing recognition algorithms","initialization method","prototype learning","prototype radiuses","Prototypes","sufficient training samples","CNN network","fine-tuning process","previous process","discriminative features","multi-class triplet thresholding method","deep neural networks","real world scenarios","unseen-category errors","UCF50","UCF11","state-of-the-art performance","distance metric","UCF101","human intervention","classification layer","HMDB51 datasets","Extensive experiments","learned knowledge","distances","practice","Manual"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current evidence surrounding the treatment of these patients during this pandemic and to provide evidence-based recommendations with attention to increased risk in this setting. DATA SOURCES A review of the literature was performed with PubMed. Because recently published articles on this topic may not yet be indexed into PubMed, otolaryngology journals were hand searched for relevant articles. Guidelines from national organizations were reviewed to identify additional relevant sources of information. REVIEW METHODS Two groups of search terms were created: one with terms related to COVID-19 and another with terms related to head and neck cancer and its management. Searches were performed of all terms in each group as well as combinations of terms between groups. Searches and subsequent exclusion of articles were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Additional articles were identified after relevant journals and guidelines from national organizations were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS Patients with head and neck mucosal malignancy require continued treatment despite the current pandemic state.

Peri-operative multimodal analgesia has been used for many years; however, its efficacy still needs improvement. In the present study, a thorough peri-operative pain counseling and stratified management program based on risk assessment was implemented, with the goal of improving post-operative analgesia and patient satisfaction. METHODS This prospective, controlled, pilot study included 361 patients who underwent elective surgery. Of these 361 patients, 187 received peri-operative pain risk assessment and stratified analgesia and counseling (stratified analgesia group), while 174 received conventional multimodal analgesia (conventional group). The two groups were compared regarding the post-operative pain intensity, rescue analgesia administration, post-operative quality of recovery as assessed via the quality of recovery 40 questionnaire, total dosage of peri-operative opioids, analgesic satisfaction, and analgesic costs. RESULTS Compared with the conventional group, the stratified analgesia group reported decreased pain intensity during motion at 24 h post-operatively and required lower dosages of rescue analgesia (P = 0.03). The total quality of recovery 40 questionnaire score and the scores for physical wellbeing and pain were significantly better in the stratified analgesia group than the conventional group (P = 0.04); the stratified analgesia group also reported better scores for analgesic satisfaction (P = 0.03) and received lower dosages of opioids (P = 0.03). Analgesic costs were lower in the stratified analgesia group than the conventional group; the cost-effective ratio was 109 in the conventional group and 62 in the stratified analgesia group. CONCLUSIONS The analgesic efficacy was improved by the implementation of stratified analgesia based on surgical pain risk assessment and counseling.

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6-8. There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 \u00D7 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness. Active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract puts the prospects of COVID-19 containment in perspective.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"W\u00F6lfel, Roman; Corman, Victor M; Guggemos, Wolfgang; Seilmaier, Michael; Zange, Sabine; M\u00FCller, Marcel A; Niemeyer, Daniela; Jones, Terry C; Vollmar, Patrick; Rothe, Camilla; Hoelscher, Michael; Bleicker, Tobias; Br\u00FCnink, Sebastian; Schneider, Julia; Ehmann, Rosina; Zwirglmaier, Katrin; Drosten, Christian; Wendtner, Clemens","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["virus receptor","Infectious virus","throat samples","proof of active virus replication","mild upper respiratory tract symptoms","upper respiratory tract tissues","body site-specific virus replication","Active replication","Pharyngeal virus shedding","mild upper respiratory tract illness","acute respiratory tract infection","viral RNA","spite of high virus RNA concentration","severe acute respiratory syndrome","cases","throat swab","lung samples","Sequence-distinct virus populations","independent replication","RNA copies","stool samples","end of symptoms","week of symptoms","early onset of severe symptoms","severe presentation","prospects of COVID","lung-derived samples","viral replicative RNA intermediates","viral load","days","receptor tropism","information","potential","immunity","control","urgent need","China","peak","SARS","sputum","usage","detailed virological analysis","oligosymptomatic transmission6","rapid decline","containment","infectivity","Initial outbreaks","pathogenicity","Coronavirus disease","perspective","patients","Blood","urine","critical courses3","Seroconversion","lung2"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent vaccine formulation (P2-VP8-P[4],[6],[8]). METHODS A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 study was done at three South African research sites. Healthy adults (aged 18-45 years), toddlers (aged 2-3 years), and infants (aged 6-8 weeks, \u226537 weeks\u0027 gestation, and without previous receipt of rotavirus vaccination), all without HIV infection, were eligible for enrolment. In the dose-escalation phase, adults and toddlers were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of five) to receive 30 \u03BCg or 90 \u03BCg of vaccine, or placebo, and infants were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of four) to receive 15 \u03BCg, 30 \u03BCg, or 90 \u03BCg of vaccine, or placebo. In the expanded phase, infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 15 \u03BCg, 30 \u03BCg, or 90 \u03BCg of vaccine, or placebo, in block sizes of four. Participants, parents of participants, and clinical, data, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. Adults received an intramuscular injection of vaccine or placebo in the deltoid muscle on the day of randomisation (day 0), day 28, and day 56; toddlers received a single injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on day 0. Infants in both phases received an injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on days 0, 28, and 56, at approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Primary safety endpoints were local and systemic reactions (grade 2 or worse) within 7 days and adverse events and serious adverse events within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one injection. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were analysed in infants in either phase who received all planned injections, had blood samples analysed at the relevant timepoints, and presented no major protocol violations considered to have an effect on the immunogenicity results of the study, and included serum anti-P2-VP8 IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibody geometric mean titres and responses measured 4 weeks after the final injection in vaccine compared with placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02646891. FINDINGS Between Feb 15, 2016, and Dec 22, 2017, 30 adults (12 each in the 30 \u03BCg and 90 \u03BCg groups and six in the placebo group), 30 toddlers (12 each in the 30 \u03BCg and 90 \u03BCg groups and six in the placebo group), and 557 infants (139 in the 15 \u03BCg group, 140 in the 30 \u03BCg group, 139 in the 90 \u03BCg group, and 139 in the placebo group) were randomly assigned, received at least one dose, and were assessed for safety. There were no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events, or unsolicited adverse events, between vaccine and placebo groups. There were no serious adverse events within 28 days of injection in adults, whereas one serious adverse event occurred in a toddler (febrile convulsion in the 30 \u03BCg group) and 23 serious adverse events (four in placebo, ten in 15 \u03BCg, four in 30 \u03BCg, and five in 90 \u03BCg groups) occurred among 20 infants, most commonly respiratory tract infections. One death occurred in an infant within 28 days of injection due to pneumococcal meningitis. In 528 infants (130 in placebo, 132 in 15 \u03BCg, 132 in 30 \u03BCg, and 134 in 90 \u03BCg groups), adjusted anti-P2-VP8 IgG seroresponses (\u22654-fold increase from baseline) to P[4], P[6], and P[8] antigens were significantly higher in the 15 \u03BCg, 30 \u03BCg, and 90 \u03BCg groups (99-100%) than in the placebo group (10-29%; p\u003C0\u00B70001). Although significantly higher than in placebo recipients (9-10%), anti-P2-VP8 IgA seroresponses (\u22654-fold increase from baseline) to each individual antigen were modest (20-34%) across the 15 \u03BCg, 30 \u03BCg, and 90 \u03BCg groups. Adjusted neutralising antibody seroresponses in infants (\u22652\u00B77-fold increase from baseline) to DS-1 (P[4]), 1076 (P[6]), and Wa (P[8]) were higher in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients: p\u003C0\u00B70001 for all comparisons. INTERPRETATION The trivalent P2-VP8 vaccine was well tolerated, with promising anti-P2-VP8 IgG and neutralising antibody responses across the three vaccine P types.

However, accuracy of visual evaluation is impaired by inter- and intra-reader variability, artifacts in the posterior fossa and limited sensitivity for subtle density shifts. We propose a machine learning approach for detecting early ischemic changes in pc-ASPECTS regions (Posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) based on admission NCCTs. METHODS The retrospective study includes 552 pc-ASPECTS regions (144 with infarctions in follow-up NCCTs) extracted from pre-therapeutic early hyperacute scans of 69 patients with basilar artery occlusion that later underwent successful recanalization. We evaluated 1218 quantitative image features utilizing random forest algorithms with fivefold cross-validation for the ability to detect early ischemic changes in hyperacute images that lead to definitive infarctions in follow-up imaging. Classifier performance was compared to conventional readings of two neuroradiologists. RESULTS Receiver operating characteristic area under the curves for detection of early ischemic changes were 0.70 (95% CI [0.64; 0.75]) for cerebellum to 0.82 (95% CI [0.77; 0.86]) for thalamus. Predictive performance of the classifier was significantly higher compared to visual reading for thalamus, midbrain, and pons (P value \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative features of early hyperacute NCCTs can be used to detect early ischemic changes in pc-ASPECTS regions. The classifier performance was higher or equal to results of human raters. The proposed approach could facilitate reproducible analysis in research and may allow standardized assessments for outcome prediction and therapy planning in clinical routine.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kniep, Helge C; Sporns, Peter B; Broocks, Gabriel; Kemmling, Andr\u00E9; Nawabi, Jawed; Rusche, Thilo; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta","journal":"Journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09859-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assessment of early ischemic changes","detection of early ischemic changes","CONCLUSIONS Quantitative features of early hyperacute NCCTs","pre-therapeutic early hyperacute scans","pc-ASPECTS regions","Classifier performance","early hyperacute non-contrast computed tomography","hyperacute images","follow-up NCCTs","Posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score","basilar artery occlusion","therapy planning","follow-up imaging","admission NCCTs","Predictive performance","thalamus","initial outcome prediction","quantitative image features","posterior fossa","definitive infarctions","visual reading","proposed approach","RESULTS Receiver","additional imaging diagnostics","OBJECTIVES Triage of patients","machine learning approach","accuracy of visual evaluation","random forest algorithms","artifacts","curves","limited sensitivity","fivefold cross-validation","midbrain","standardized assessments","intra-reader variability","subtle density shifts","characteristic area","research","reproducible analysis","retrospective study","pons","conventional readings","successful recanalization","clinical routine","P value","METHODS","human raters","neuroradiologists","cerebellum"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS The severity score post-HFNC initiation was significantly associated with coinfection [odds ratio (OR): 1.361; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.786; P = 0.027]. The likelihood of coinfection decreased by 23.1% for each increase of saturation O2 after HFNC initiation (OR: 0.769; 95% CI: 0.609-0.972; P = 0.028). Atelectasis was more likely to occur in coinfection (OR: 2.923; 95% CI: 1.049-8.148; P = 0.04). The duration of HFNC treatment increased significantly in coinfection (OR: 1.018; 95% CI: 1.006-1.029; P = 0.002). No significant differences were described between HFNC failure and the number and the type of detected viruses. CONCLUSIONS The detection of multiple viruses and the type of virus did not influence the HFNC failure, although the coinfection was associated with a deterioration of severity score, a longer HFNC treatment and a major presence of atelectasis. The role of coinfection on HFNC treatment might subtend a complex interplay between multiple viruses and host susceptibility.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferro, Valentina; Boccuzzi, Elena; Battaglia, Massimo; Rossi, Francesco Paolo; Olita, Carla; Giglioni, Emanuele; Concato, Carlo; Piccioni, Livia; Perrotta, Daniela; Reale, Antonino; Raucci, Umberto","journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31725117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Atelectasis"],"organizations":["HFNC","Emergency Department"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HFNC failure","longer HFNC treatment","duration of HFNC treatment","time of HFNC initiation","post-HFNC initiation","role of coinfection","detection of multiple viruses","type of virus","contribution of coinfection","likelihood of coinfection","multiple virus infections","number of virus","failure groups","role of multiple respiratory viruses","type of detected viruses","clinical course of bronchiolitis","clinical response","deterioration of severity score","higher level of care","major presence of atelectasis","pediatric intensive care unit","invasive ventilation","transfer","Helmet-Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","hours","specific outcomes","complex interplay","relation","high-flow nasal cannula","escalation","host susceptibility","months","single","increase of saturation O2","BACKGROUND","children","CONCLUSIONS","significant differences","comparison","Emergency Department","METHODS","confidence interval","nasopharyngeal aspirates","odds ratio"],"language":"en"},

This may provide increased access to diabetes health care in certain settings. However, health care disparities continue to challenge availability of diabetes technologies for underprivileged communities. We report our experience with two patients providing diabetes care effectively and preventing hospital admissions by using telehealth. Methods: Two adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D): one new onset and the other one with established T1D are presented where telehealth facilitated by Clarity Software and the \u0022Share\u0022 feature with the use of Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for management of diabetic ketosis and hyperglycemia. Results: Both patients were managed effectively virtually despite higher risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Shared glucose data through CGM facilitated frequent insulin dose adjustments, increased fluid and carbohydrate intake, and prevented hospital admissions in both cases. In the case of new onset patient with T1D, most of the education was done remotely by certified diabetes care and education specialists. Conclusion: Acute diabetes complication like DKA increases morbidity and mortality in addition to adding cost to the health care system.

Most common toxicities of any grade were fatigue (54%), anaemia (38%), neutropenia (29%), leukopenia (26%) and diarrhoea (21%). Median PFS was similar in both refractory (1.8 months) and sensitive cohorts (1.9 months), while median OS was longer in sensitive one (6.6 versus 3.6 months). CONCLUSIONS Although nab-paclitaxel has shown some modest anti-tumour activity in relapsed SCLC, associated with a favourable toxicity profile, the primary end-point of the study was not met.

General anesthesia was induced in eight healthy adult male Beagles. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed in the pulmonary artery via the jugular vein for cardiac output measurements. A Foley urethral catheter was placed to monitor transvesical IAP. A 10 mm balloon blunt-tip trocar was inserted into the retroperitoneal space. With a fixed respiratory rate and tidal volume by mechanical ventilation, insufflation pressure was sequentially increased from 0 to 10 mmHg in 5 mmHg increments, followed by desufflation. All variables were measured before insufflation, 5 min after the establishment of each insufflation pressure, and after desufflation. At 10 mmHg, the IAP was nearly equal to insufflation pressure. Cardiopulmonary function was not compromised at any point, although the cardiac index (CI), heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased within normal ranges. End-tidal CO2 concentration, arterial CO2 partial pressure, and oxygen delivery index (DO2I) increased, whereas pH decreased, at 10 mmHg. CI, MAP, and DO2I did not recover to baseline after decompression. Thus, retroperitoneal CO2 insufflation up to 10 mmHg is well tolerated by mechanically ventilated dogs positioned in sternal recumbency with the abdomen unsupported, although sympathetic changes may occur with an insufflation pressure increase.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Son, Hyunglak; Ko, Jonghyeok; Jeong, Junemoe; Lee, Sungin; Sihn, Dongmin; Kweon, Oh-Kyeong; Kim, Wan Hee","journal":"The Journal of veterinary medical science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.19-0330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["insufflation pressure increase","retroperitoneal CO2 insufflation","pulmonary arterial pressure","arterial CO2 partial pressure","intra-abdominal pressure","mmHg increments","End-tidal CO2 concentration","abdomen unsupported","sternal recumbency","cardiac index","ventilated dogs","cardiopulmonary variables","transvesical IAP","retroperitoneal space","MAP","DO2I","CI","desufflation","tidal volume","heart rate","pulmonary artery","effects of retroperitoneal carbon dioxide","Cardiopulmonary function","oxygen delivery index","fixed respiratory rate","cardiac output measurements","Foley urethral catheter","Swan-Ganz catheter","mechanical ventilation","towels","jugular vein","pectoral","placement","positioning kit","sympathetic changes","normal ranges","healthy adult male Beagles","tip trocar","pelvic regions","study","point","establishment","General anesthesia","balloon","pH","decompression"],"language":"en"},

Early initiation of caffeine administration has increased in the past decades with the purpose of reducing respiratory morbidity. However, there might be harms associated with this approach. This systematic review aims to assess whether early administration of caffeine reduces morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. METHODS The methods were published in a preregistered protocol. The literature search was performed in February 2019 with no restrictions for language or publication date. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing early versus late caffeine administration to infants born before week 34 were included. RESULTS Two RCTs and 14 cohort studies were included. All studies but one had a serious/critical overall risk of bias. Few studies reported on long-term or patient-relevant outcomes. No meta-analysis could be performed. CONCLUSION Based on the available evidence, no conclusions about the optimal timing of caffeine administration can be drawn. There are inherent methodological problems in the cohort studies. RCTs are needed to answer the question of optimal timing for caffeine administration in neonatal care.

Pharmaceutical therapy is a valuable component of conservative obesity therapy. Herein, medications currently in the phase of preclinical or clinical testing are reviewed, along with an overview of the mechanisms that regulate energy intake and expenditure. In addition, the current and potential future directions of obesity drug therapy are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Although the current arsenal of obesity pharmacotherapy is limited, a considerable number of agents that exert their actions through a variety of pharmacodynamic targets and mechanisms are in the pipeline. This expansion shapes a potential near future of obesity conservative management, characterized by tailored combined therapeutic regimens, targeting not only weight loss but also improved overall health outcomes. The progress regarding the elucidation of the mechanisms which regulate the bodily energy equilibrium has led to medications which mimic hormonal adaptations that follow bariatric surgery, in the quest for a \u0022Medical bypass.\u0022 These, combined with agents which could increase energy expenditure, point to a brilliant future in the conservative treatment of obesity.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsilingiris, Dimitrios; Liatis, Stavros; Dalamaga, Maria; Kokkinos, Alexander","journal":"Current obesity reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-020-00378-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conservative treatment of obesity","future of obesity conservative management","mechanisms","valuable component of conservative obesity therapy","potential future directions of obesity drug therapy","global prevalence of obesity","current arsenal of obesity pharmacotherapy","energy expenditure","brilliant future","Pharmaceutical therapy","medications","energy intake","bodily energy equilibrium","considerable number of agents","combined therapeutic regimens","weight loss","actions","steep rise","variety of pharmacodynamic targets","quest","bariatric surgery","phase of preclinical","hormonal adaptations","overall health outcomes","RECENT FINDINGS","expansion shapes","clinical testing","addition","Medical bypass","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","progress","elucidation","pipeline","overview"],"language":"en"},

Surgeons rely on preoperative imaging to guide their resection; however, large tissue deformations occur during trans-oral procedures due to placement of necessary retractors and laryngoscopes which hinders the surgeon\u0027s ability to accurately assess tumor extent and location of critical structures. We propose an image-guided framework utilizing intraoperative imaging and deformation modeling to improve surgeon accuracy and confidence. A CT-compatible laryngoscopy system previously developed was evaluated in this framework. Intraoperative images were acquired during laryngoscopy; force-sensing capabilities were enabled in the laryngoscope; and tracking of the scope and anatomic features was trialed. Tissue deformation and displacement were quantified and determined to be extensive, with values \u003C; 4.6 cm in the tongue, \u003C; 1.8 cm in bony structures, and \u003C; 108.9 cm3 in airway volume change. Surgical navigation using intraoperative imaging and tracking was evaluated. Preliminary assessment of deformation modeling showed potential to supplement intraoperative imaging.

For hospices with terminally ill patients, the trade-off between compassion and infection control becomes a difficult decision. This study aimed to survey the changes in visiting policy for all 76 hospice wards in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The altered visiting policies were assessed by the number of visitors per patient allowed at one time, the daily number of visiting slots, the number of hours open daily, and requisites for hospice ward entry. The differences in visiting policies between hospice wards and ordinary wards were also investigated. Data were collected by reviewing the official website of each hospital and were supplemented by phone calls in cases where no information was posted on the website. One quarter (n = 20) of hospice wards had different visiting policies to those of ordinary wards in the same hospital. Only one hospice ward operated an open policy, and in contrast, nine (11.8%) stopped visits entirely. Among the 67 hospice wards that allowed visiting, at most, two visitors at one time per patient were allowed in 46 (68.6%), one visiting time daily was allowed in 32 (47.8%), one hour of visiting per day was allowed in 29 (43.3%), and checking of identity and travel history was carried out in 12 wards (17.9%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all hospice wards in Taiwan changed their visiting policies, but the degree of restriction varied.

We aimed to investigate the differential expression of five miRNAs (21, 200c, 204, 205, and 211) in benign naevi (n = 42), dysplastic naevi (n = 41), melanoma in situ (n = 42), and melanoma (n = 42) and evaluate their potential as diagnostic biomarkers of melanocytic lesions. Real-time PCR showed differential miRNA expression profiles between benign naevi; dysplastic naevi and melanoma in situ; and invasive melanoma. We applied a random forest machine learning algorithm to classify cases based on their miRNA expression profiles, which resulted in a ROC curve analysis of 0.99 for malignant melanoma and greater than 0.9 for all other groups. This indicates an overall very high accuracy of our panel of miRNAs as a diagnostic biomarker of benign, dysplastic, and malignant melanocytic lesions. However, the impact of variable lesion percentage and spatial expression patterns of miRNAs on these real-time PCR results was also considered. In situ hybridisation confirmed the expression of miRNA 21 and 211 in melanocytes, while demonstrating expression of miRNA 205 only in keratinocytes, thus calling into question its value as a biomarker of melanocytic lesions. In conclusion, we have validated some miRNAs, including miRNA 21 and 211, as potential diagnostic biomarkers of benign, dysplastic, and malignant melanocytic lesions. However, we also highlight the crucial importance of considering tissue morphology and spatial expression patterns when using molecular techniques for the discovery and validation of new biomarkers.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quiohilag, Katherine; Caie, Peter; Oniscu, Anca; Brenn, Thomas; Harrison, David","journal":"Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-020-02817-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388720/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of miRNA","malignant lesions","malignant melanocytic lesions","benign naevi","differential expression","malignant melanoma","diagnostic biomarkers of melanocytic lesions","biomarker of melanocytic lesions","dysplastic naevi","differential miRNA expression profiles","diagnosis of melanocytic lesions","spatial expression patterns of miRNAs","diagnostic biomarker of benign","potential diagnostic biomarkers of benign","invasive melanoma","panel of miRNAs","situ hybridisation","lack of firm diagnostic criteria","real-time PCR results","validation of new biomarkers","high accuracy","high rates of inter-observer variation","malignancy result","cases","tissue morphology","molecular techniques","impact of variable lesion percentage","discovery","random forest machine learning algorithm","ROC curve analysis","value","histological features","crucial importance","question","keratinocytes","melanocytes","groups","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The 2-year follow-up results of ATTRACTION-2 are presented herein. METHODS ATTRACTION-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (49 sites; Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The median (min-max) follow-up period was 27.3 (24.1-36.3) months. The primary endpoint was OS. A subanalysis of OS was performed based on best overall response and tumor-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression status. RESULTS Overall, 493 of 601 screened patients were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (330) or placebo (163). OS (median [95% confidence interval; CI]) was significantly longer in the nivolumab group (5.26 [4.60-6.37] vs 4.14 [3.42-4.86] months in placebo group) at the 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.62 [0.51-0.76]; P \u003C 0.0001). A higher OS rate was observed in the nivolumab vs placebo group at 1 (27.3% vs 11.6%) and 2 years (10.6% vs 3.2%). The OS benefit was observed regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Among patients with a complete or partial response (CR or PR) in the nivolumab group, the median OS (95% CI) was 26.6 (21.65-not applicable) months; the OS rates at 1 and 2 years were 87.1% and 61.3%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS Nivolumab treatment resulted in clinically meaningful long-term improvements in OS in patients with previously treated G/GEJ cancer. The long-term survival benefit of nivolumab was most evident in patients with a CR or PR.","publish_time":"2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Li-Tzong; Satoh, Taroh; Ryu, Min-Hee; Chao, Yee; Kato, Ken; Chung, Hyun Cheol; Chen, Jen-Shi; Muro, Kei; Kang, Won Ki; Yeh, Kun-Huei; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Oh, Sang Cheul; Bai, Li-Yuan; Tamura, Takao; Lee, Keun-Wook; Hamamoto, Yasuo; Kim, Jong Gwang; Chin, Keisho; Oh, Do-Youn; Minashi, Keiko; Cho, Jae Yong; Tsuda, Masahiro; Sameshima, Hiroki; Kang, Yoon-Koo; Boku, Narikazu","journal":"Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-019-01034-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31863227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Nivolumab","G/GEJ"],"locations":["Japan","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["median OS","OS benefit","nivolumab group","OS rates","subanalysis of OS","nivolumab vs placebo group","BACKGROUND Nivolumab","higher OS rate","long-term survival benefit of nivolumab","CONCLUSIONS Nivolumab treatment","screened patients","CI","months","overall survival","year follow-up results of ATTRACTION","best overall response","tumor PD-L1 expression","phase","GEJ cancer","treated G","follow-up period","METHODS ATTRACTION","years","partial response","expression status","meaningful long-term improvements","tumor-programmed death ligand","gastroesophageal junction","Japan","sites","South Korea","trial","study","hazard ratio","confidence interval","Taiwan","max","new safety signals","chemotherapy regimens","primary endpoint"],"language":"en"},

Evidence suggests that the biosynthesis of indigo alkaloids in plants occurs via the shikimate pathway. The enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) is involved in plant metabolism; however, its underlying putative mechanism of regulating the production of indigo alkaloids is currently unknown. RESULTS One gene encoding EPSPS was isolated from B. cusia. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that BcEPSPS was expressed at the highest level in the stem and upregulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The results of subcellular localization indicated that BcEPSPS is mainly expressed in both the plastids and cytosol, which has not been previously reported. An enzyme assay revealed that the heterogeneously expressed BcEPSPS protein catalysed the generation of 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate. The overexpression of BcEPSPS in Isatis indigotica hairy roots resulted in the high accumulation of indigo alkaloids, such as indigo, secologanin, indole and isorhamnetin. CONCLUSIONS The function of BcEPSPS in catalysing the production of EPSP and regulating indigo alkaloid biosynthesis was revealed, which provided a distinct view of plant metabolic engineering.

However, it remains unclear whether patients who do not show overt seizure behavior develop neurological consequences. Therefore, this study compared two subpopulations of rats with a low versus high seizure response to diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to evaluate whether acute OP intoxication causes persistent neuropathology in non-seizing individuals. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im), and pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im) were monitored for seizure activity for 4 h post-exposure. Animals were separated into groups with low versus high seizure response based on behavioral criteria and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Cholinesterase activity was evaluated by Ellman assay, and neuropathology was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, and 60 days post-exposure by Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining and micro-CT imaging. DFP significantly inhibited cholinesterase activity in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala to the same extent in low and high responders. FJC staining revealed significant neurodegeneration in DFP low responders albeit this response was delayed, less persistent, and decreased in magnitude compared to DFP high responders. Micro-CT scans at 60 days revealed extensive mineralization that was not significantly different between low versus high DFP responders. These findings highlight the importance of considering non-seizing patients for medical care in the event of acute OP intoxication. They also suggest that OP intoxication may induce neurological damage via seizure-independent mechanisms, which if identified, might provide insight into novel therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez, Eduardo A; Rindy, Alexa C; Guignet, Michelle A; Calsbeek, Jonas J; Bruun, Donald A; Dhir, Ashish; Andrew, Peter; Saito, Naomi; Rowland, Douglas J; Harvey, Danielle J; Rogawski, Michael A; Lein, Pamela J","journal":"Archives of toxicology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-020-02747-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OP","DFP","Fluoro-Jade C","FJC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DFP low responders","DFP high responders","high DFP responders","high seizure response","seizure activity","persistent neuropathology","event of acute OP intoxication","overt seizure behavior","seizure-independent mechanisms","FJC staining","non-seizing patients","days post-exposure","inhibited cholinesterase activity","non-seizing individuals","h post-exposure","Micro-CT scans","micro-CT imaging","neurological damage","neurological consequences","subpopulations of rats","Adult male Sprague Dawley rats","Fluoro-Jade C","medical care","behavioral criteria","cognitive deficits","humans","significant neurodegeneration","electroencephalogram","seizures","cortex","groups","diisopropylfluorophosphate","extensive mineralization","preclinical models","EEG","threat agents","amygdala","hippocampus","importance","status epilepticus","Ellman assay","extent","magnitude","insight","novel therapeutic targets","recordings","Organophosphate","atropine sulfate","study","findings","Animals","pralidoxime"],"language":"en"},

The aim was to identify the key domains that should be considered when developing pandemic preparedness plans for surgical services. METHODS A scoping search was conducted to identify published articles relating to management of surgical patients during pandemics. Key informant interviews were conducted with surgeons and anaesthetists with direct experience of working during infectious disease outbreaks, in order to identify key challenges and solutions to delivering effective surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Thirteen articles were identified from the scoping search, and surgeons and anaesthetists representing 11 territories were interviewed. To mount an effective response to COVID-19, a pandemic response plan for surgical services should be developed in advance. Key domains that should be included are: provision of staff training (such as patient transfers, donning and doffing personal protection equipment, recognizing and managing COVID-19 infection); support for the overall hospital response to COVID-19 (reduction in non-urgent activities such as clinics, endoscopy, non-urgent elective surgery); establishment of a team-based approach for running emergency services; and recognition and management of COVID-19 infection in patients treated as an emergency and those who have had surgery. A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes.

Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as \u0027Lungene\u0027.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 v\u00EDrus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.

The S1 genes of 37 PEDV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced, and compared to the standard CV777 strain, 120 nucleotides were found to have mutations. RESULTS The nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between the sequences and those of the CV777 strain were 90%-91% and 88.2%-90%, respectively, and their homologies to the vaccine strain were 88.6%-89.7% and 86.2%-87.8%, respectively. Genetic evolution and variation analyses indicated that the 37 PEDV strains belonged to genogroup 2-1, while the CV777 strain, vaccine strain, and earlier Chinese strains all belonged to genogroup 1-1.

This research aims to build a classifier prediction model to predict the status of recovered and death coronavirus CovID-19 patients in South Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS Artificial neural network principle is used to classify the collected data between February 20, 2020 and March 9, 2020. The proposed classifier used different seven variables, namely, country, infection reason, sex, group, confirmation date, birth year, and region. The most effective variables on recovered and fatal cases are analyzed based on the neural network model. RESULTS The results found that the proposed predictive classifier efficiently predicted recovered and death cases. Besides, it is found that discovering the infection reason would increase the probability to recover the patient. This indicates that the virus might be controllable based on infection reasons. In addition, the earlier discovery of the disease affords better control and a higher probability of being recovered. CONCLUSIONS Our recommendation is to use this model to predict the status of the patients globally.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Najjar, H; Al-Rousan, N","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["status","proposed classifier","death cases","classifier prediction model","neural network model","proposed predictive classifier","death coronavirus CovID","infection reasons","fatal cases","infected cases","patients","results","OBJECTIVE Coronavirus COVID","effective variables","higher probability","METHODS Artificial neural network principle","group","confirmation date","sex","better control","disease","birth year","MATERIALS","country","earlier discovery","basing","South Korea","treatment process","region","factors","addition","recommendation","research","collected data","CONCLUSIONS","countries"],"language":"en"},

At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, M L; Yang, J M; Sun, Y P; Su, G H","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.03.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II"],"organizations":["ACE/Ang II","RAS","ACEI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ang","RAS system","human ACE2","exhaustion of ACE2","symptoms of acute severe pneumonia","exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia","RAS inhibitors","binding of COVID","AT1R pathway","Mas receptor pathway","AT1R inhibitors","infected patients","multi-system inflammation","Increased ACE","mortality rate","poor prognostic factors","respiratory failure","condition of controlling blood pressure","pulmonary inflammatory response","effective treatment","Animal studies","important role","imbalance","novel coronavirus","ACEI","present"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses among Malaysian children with confirmed respiratory infections between July 2014 and July 2015. Methods A total of 394 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected prospectively from children age 0-5 years old with ARTIs from hospitals in Kuala Lumpur. Respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay was used to identify the viral aetiology of respiratory infections. Results From a total of 394 samples, the positive detection rate was 79.9% (n=315). A total of 15 types of RNA viruses and a single type of DNA virus were detected. Enterovirus/rhinovirus (n=112, 28.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n=85, 21.6%), adenovirus (n=64, 16.2%), human bocavirus (n=34, 8.6%), and human metapneumovirus (n=29, 7.4%) were the five predominant viruses. Enterovirus/rhinovirus and RSV constituted most of the viral respiratory infections among young children, especially among children less than 1 year old. No coronavirus was detected among children between 3 and 5 years old. Co-infection caused by 2 or 3 respiratory viruses were detected in 52 patients (13.2%). Enterovirus/rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus demonstrated pronounced seasonality. The infection rate peaked during mid-year, while the lowest activity occurred during early of the year. Conclusions The use of molecular assay as a routine diagnostic in the hospitals can improve the diagnosis and management of respiratory tract infections among children.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yew, Su Mei; Tan, Ka-Liong; Yeo, Siok Koon; Ng, Kee Peng; Kuan, Chee Sian","journal":"Journal of thoracic disease","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2019.10.69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Kuala Lumpur"],"keyphrases":["viral respiratory infections","confirmed respiratory infections","viral aetiology of respiratory infections","young children","Respiratory viral panel","acute respiratory tract infections","management of respiratory tract infections","Malaysian children","molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses","children age","respiratory syncytial virus","total","year old","rhinovirus","Enterovirus","predominant viruses","human bocavirus","years old","ARTIs","hospitals","types of RNA viruses","RSV","adenovirus","mid-year","infection rate","human metapneumovirus","use of molecular assay","Co-infection","positive detection rate","single type of DNA virus","developing countries","samples","main cause of morbidity","mortality","diagnosis","routine diagnostic","nasopharyngeal swabs","RVP","lowest activity","Kuala Lumpur","pronounced seasonality","Background","Methods","Conclusions","study","Results","patients","coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

One of the most important public health problems is \u0022war\u0022. The aim of the present paper, therefore, is threefold: firstly, to determine to what extent war has been investigated from an epidemiological point of view; secondly, what the definition and scope of \u0022war epidemiology\u0022 would be; and thirdly, if it would be possible to introduce a new branch of epidemiology entitled \u0022peace epidemiology\u0022. In the present study, I have tried to fulfill the aims of the study based on my experiences in war and peace epidemiology and also by reviewing the most relevant websites, documents and papers. Evidence suggests that enough epidemiological studies have not been carried out to determine the sheer public health consequences of war. \u0022War epidemiology\u0022 can be defined as \u0022the study of the distribution and determinants of war-related events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of war\u0022. \u0022Peace epidemiology\u0022 is a new branch of epidemiology which \u0022highlights how peace could positively shape our world\u0022.

IBV was detected in the small intestine, but not in the respiratory tract or kidney. During virus isolation in embryos, it did not replicate in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) but could be recovered from intestines. Its S1 protein showed 93% amino acid sequence identity to a California variant isolated in 1999 (Cal99). Intestinal lesions were reproduced following ocular/nasal inoculation of specific-pathogen-free chickens, but respiratory signs and lesions were also present. The virus was detected in both respiratory and intestinal tissues. To determine whether the novel tropism of IBV CalEnt was due to an increased ability of its S1 protein to bind to the intestinal epithelium, we compared the binding of soluble trimeric recombinant S1 proteins derived from CalEnt and Cal99 to chicken tissues. Contrary to expectations, the CalEnt S1 protein did not bind to small intestine and, unlike Cal99 S1, did not bind to the respiratory epithelium or CAM. Using only the CalEnt S1 N-terminal domain or including the S2 ectodomain (lacking membrane and cytoplasmic domains), which have been shown to improve ArkDPI S1 protein binding, did not lead to detectable binding at the standard protein concentration to any tissue tested. Our results indicate no/poor binding of the CalEnt spike protein to both respiratory and intestinal tissues and thus do not support better attachment to intestinal epithelial cells as a reason for CalEnt\u0027s extended tropism. These results might reflect shortcomings of the assay, including that it does not detect potential contributions of the S1 C-terminal domain to attachment. We used bioinformatic approaches to explore the possibility that the unique tropism of CalEnt might be a result of functions of the S protein in cell-entry steps subsequent to attachment. These analyses suggest that CalEnt\u0027s S2 coding region was acquired through a recombination event and encodes a unique amino acid sequence at the putative recognition site for the protease that activates the S protein for fusion. Thus, S2 activation by tissue-specific proteases might facilitate CalEnt entry into intestinal epithelial cells and compensate for poor binding by its S1 protein.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saiada, Farjana; Gallardo, Rodrigo A; Shivaprasad, H L; Corsiglia, Charles; Van Santen, Vicky L","journal":"Avian diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.1.23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","CAM"],"locations":["California"],"keyphrases":["CalEnt S1 protein","CalEnt spike protein","ArkDPI S1 protein binding","Cal99 S1","S protein","CalEnt entry","unique tropism of CalEnt","intestinal tissues","CalEnt S1 N-terminal domain","novel tropism of IBV CalEnt","Intestinal lesions","intestinal epithelium","standard protein concentration","poor binding","S1 C-terminal domain","respiratory epithelium","intestinal epithelial cells","detectable binding","binding of soluble trimeric recombinant S1 proteins","respiratory signs","respiratory tract","CalEnt\u0027s extended tropism","unique amino acid sequence","S2 ectodomain","S2 activation","better attachment","unusual enteric tropism","small intestine","chicken tissues","virus isolation","results","CAM","amino acid sequence identity","CalEnt\u0027s S2 coding region","tissue-specific proteases","California variant isolated","infectious bronchitis virus","lacking membrane","chorioallantoic membrane","nasal inoculation of specific","California broiler flock","cell-entry steps subsequent","putative recognition site","pathogen-free chickens","following ocular","reason","recombination event","possibility","result of functions","runting-stunting syndrome","cytoplasmic domains","increased ability","analyses","expectations","potential contributions","bioinformatic approaches","shortcomings","assay","embryos","kidney","fusion","intestines"],"language":"en"},

Serum antibody testing is becoming one of the critical methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. We investigated IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein after symptom onset in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. 130 blood samples from 38 COVID-19 patients were collected. The levels of IgM and IgG specific to N and S protein were detected by ELISA. A series of blood samples were collected along the disease course from the same patient, including 11 ICU patients and 27 non-ICU patients for longitudinal analysis. N and S specific IgM and IgG (N-IgM, N-IgG, S-IgM, S-IgG) in non-ICU patients increased after symptom onset. N-IgM and S-IgM in some non-ICU patients reached a peak in the second week, while N-IgG and S-IgG continued to increase in the third week. The combined detection of N and S specific IgM and IgG could identify up to 75% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the first week. S-IgG was significantly higher in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients in the third week. In contrast, N-IgG was significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. The increase of S-IgG positively correlated with the decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-ICU patients. N and S specific IgM and IgG increased gradually after symptom onset and can be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, commonly used models are often highly simplified representations of incredibly complex systems. Because of these simplifications, the model output, of say new cases of a disease over time, or when an epidemic will occur, may be inconsistent with available data. In this case, we must improve the model, especially if we plan to make decisions based on it that could affect human health and safety, but direct improvements are often beyond our reach. In this work, we explore this problem through a case study of the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2016. We propose an embedded discrepancy operator---a modification to the model equations that requires modest information about the system and is calibrated by all relevant data. We show that the new enriched model demonstrates greatly increased consistency with real data.

Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual\u0027s phone establishes bluetooth contact with the phone of an infected person. We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of binary \u0022infected\u0022 or \u0022uninfected\u0022 statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated. In the real world, where most known-infected persons are isolated or quarantined and where many individuals may not carry their mobiles in public, we believe the improvement offered by our method warrants consideration. Importantly, in view of widespread concerns on privacy and contact-tracing, our method relies mainly on direct contact data that can be stored locally on users\u0027 phones, and uses limited communication via intermediary servers only upon testing, mitigating privacy concerns.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guttal, V.; Krishna, S.; Siddharthan, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5146431b0190f95e02829a06ac2f73729ef6c98.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20080648v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["contact-tracing","bluetooth contact","contact information","naive immediate-contact method","naive method","individuals","direct contact data","known-infected persons","tracing contacts of infectious patients","network of contacts","risk of infection","privacy concerns","probabilities of recent contacts","governments","infection risk probability","infectious peak","mobile technologies","individual\u0027s phone","mobile apps","warning system","strong flattening","users\u0027 phones","real world","real life","view of widespread concerns","pandemic","limited communication","testing","statuses","ideal circumstance","intermediary servers","current COVID","targeted intervention strategy","small fraction of cases","India","purpose","improvement","public","model","mobiles","binary","methodology","realistic networks","consideration","robustness","disease"],"language":"en"},

Methods: From 16th to 24th March 2020, 241 consecutive patients addressed to hospital for COVID-19 suspicion had both chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 3 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, and not evocative or normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. Results: Observer agreement across the 3 categories was good between all readers (kappa value 0.68 95%CI 0.67-0.70) and good to very good between pairs of readers (0.64-0.85). It was very good (0.81 95%CI 0.79-0.83), fair (0.32 95%CI 0.29-0.34) and good (0.74 95%CI 0.71-0.76) for the categories evocative, compatible and not evocative or normal, respectively. RT-PCR was positive in 97%, 50% and 27% of cases classified in the respective categories. Observer agreement was lower (p=0.045) and RT-PCR positive cases were less frequently categorized evocative in presence of an underlying pulmonary disease (p\u003C0.001). Conclusion: Inter-observer agreement for chest CT reporting using categorization of findings is good in patients suspected of COVID-19. Among patients considered for hospitalization in an epidemic context, CT categorized evocative is highly predictive of COVID-19, whereas the predictive value of CT decreases between the categories compatible and not evocative.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Debray, M.-P.; Tarabay, H.; Males, L.; Chalhoub, N.; Mahdjoub, E.; Pavlovsky, T.; Visseaux, B.; Bouzid, D.; Borie, R.; Wackenheim, C.; Crestani, B.; Rioux, C.; Saker, L.; Choquet, C.; Mullaert, J.; Khalil, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89c8e878cb23dfefe7c66c728f6392505fa5e146.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20094102v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","Kappa"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["categories evocative","inter-observer agreement","categories compatible","predictive of COVID","pairs of readers","respective categories","RT-PCR positive cases","predictive value of CT decreases","clinical significance of chest CT reporting","consecutive patients","categorization of findings","consensus categorization","kappa value","results","junior radiologists","Kappa coefficient","general senior radiologists","similar experience","suspicion","SARS-CoV","underlying pulmonary disease","epidemic context","presence","emergency physicians","hospitalization","Conclusion","pneumonia","Objectives","observers","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Using the vector autoregression (VAR) model, this study analyzes the impact of urbanization on pollution-related agricultural input intensity in Hubei, China. Results of an impulse response function analysis reveal that pesticide use intensity continues to rise following shocks from the urban population proportion and the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. Responses of chemical fertilizer intensity first decrease and then increase subjected to the shocks from the urban population proportion and secondary and tertiary industry proportion. The intensity of agricultural plastic film use first increases and then decreases when receives the shocks from the urban population proportion which is the opposite to the response to the shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. In addition, the responses of pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity trend decrease following their own shocks after positive initial responses. The variance decomposition results demonstrate that the shocks due to pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity generally explain the largest proportion of their own variation over the 10-year horizon. However, an increase in the urban population proportion plays a critical role in determining the variations of pesticide use intensity in late periods, it account for 56.88% the variations in the tenth period. And the contribution of the urban population proportion to the variations in agricultural plastic film use intensity increases consistently, it account for 33.74% of the variations in the tenth period. Therefore, the hidden drivers of these phenomena need to be further understood regarding the relationships between urbanization and diffuse pollution from agricultural production.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"You, Heyuan","journal":"Ecological Indicators","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46c645c9ad604d7cb3740e444618b75e32012d66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1470160X15006330; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X15006330","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["variations of pesticide use intensity","responses of pesticide use intensity","chemical fertilizer use intensity","intensity trend","intensity of agricultural plastic film","urban population proportion","Abstract Agricultural input intensity","Responses of chemical fertilizer intensity","pollution-related agricultural input intensity","tertiary industry proportion","largest proportion","agricultural production","following shocks","impact of urbanization","diffuse pollution","rapid urbanization","China","increase","positive initial responses","serious non-point pollution","variance decomposition results","impulse response function analysis","critical role","model","Hubei","opposite","late periods","study","vector autoregression","relationships","addition","contribution","hidden drivers","phenomena","year horizon"],"language":"en"},

Simulation studies were carried out to understand the outcomes under the scenarios if early-implementation and removal of stay-at-home order occurred. SETTING: Population data in the United States PARTICIPANTS: Residents in the U.S., who were affected by the stay-at-home and face-masking policies MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Turning-points of the daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) in the U.S. RESULTS: The number and the proportion of U.S. residents under SAHO increased between March 19 and April 7, and plateaued at 29,0829,980 and 88.6%, respectively. The trend in COVID-19 daily cases reduced after March 23 (P\u003C0.001) and further reduced on April 3 (P\u003C0.001), which was associated with implementation of SAHO by 10 states on March 23, and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recommendation of face-masking, respectively. Similar turning points were identified in the trends of daily deaths with a lag time. The estimates of Rt based on the 3 reported mean serial-intervals of COVID-19 all started to decline on March 19, when SAHO was first implemented in the U.S. and declined faster after March 23. After a short plateau, Rt continued to decline after April 3 and fell below/around 1.0 on April 13. CONCLUSIONS: There were 2 turning points of COVID-19 daily new cases or deaths in the U.S., which appeared to associate with implementation of SAHO and the CDC face-masking recommendation. Simulation on early-implementation and removal of SAHO reveals considerable impact on COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths. These findings may inform decision-making of lifting SAHO and face.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, J.; Hussain, S.; Lu, G.; Wei, S.; Bao, W.; Zhang, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d94a3407f415fbd7ac9cdfdf2e0a32e8bc52c27.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20088237v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAHO","CDC"],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["deaths of COVID","points of COVID","daily cases","daily new cases","implementation of SAHO","trends of daily deaths","removal of SAHO","CDC face-masking recommendation","Similar turning points","Preventions recommendation of face","deaths of laboratory","early-implementation","decision-making of lifting SAHO","removal of stay-at-home order","face-masking policies MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","United States DESIGN","United States PARTICIPANTS","associations of stay-at-home order","Residents","estimates of Rt","Disease Control","coronavirus disease","lag time","Simulation studies","Piecewise log-linear modelling of temporal trends","time-varying reproduction numbers","Population data","considerable impact","quasi-experimental study","reported mean serial-intervals","Centers","proportion of","SETTING","RESULTS","findings","scenarios","short plateau","outcomes","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

With such improvements, the world might find cures for incurable diseases like HIV disease and Cancer sooner. Our approach presented in this paper is to utilize a multi-core environment to introduce Data Level Parallelism (DLP) to the Autodock Vina software, which is a widely used for molecular docking software. Autodock Vina already exploits Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) in multi-core environments and therefore optimized for such environments. However, with the results we have obtained, it can be clearly seen that our approach has enhanced the throughput of the already optimized software by more than six times. This will dramatically reduce the time consumed for the lead identification phase in drug designing along with the shift in the processor technology from multi-core to many-core of the current era. Therefore, we believe that the contribution of this project will effectively make it possible to expand the number of small molecules docked against a drug target and improving the chances to design drugs for incurable diseases.","publish_time":"2013-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Senanayake, Upul; Prabuddha, Rahal; Ragel, Roshan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20694e3ba90fd8cea22a74338bc3c43fbe956256.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.1003v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multi-core environments","optimized software","drug designing process","Autodock Vina software","molecular docking software","incurable diseases","drug target","throughput of molecular docking","approach","Data Level Parallelism","Instruction Level Parallelism","intensive phase","virtual screening process","lead identification phase","cures","DLP","ILP","HIV disease","chances","significant weight","number of small molecules","world","Cancer","shift","processor technology","sought area of research","drugs","paper","project","improvements","current era","times","contribution","results"],"language":"en"},

The fast and relentless spread nCOVID-19 has basically segmented the populace only into merely into three classes, such as susceptible, infected and recovered compartments. Adapting the classical SEIR- type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model. The SEIR dynamics are expressed using ordinary differential equations. The creators initially determined the parameters of the model from the accessible day by day information for Indian States dependent on around 35 days history of diseases, recuperation and deaths. The determined parameters have been amassed to extend future patterns for the Indian subcontinent, which is right now at a beginning time in the contamination cycle. The novelty of the study lies in the prediction of both the pessimistic and optimistic mathematical model based comprehensive analysis of nCOVID-19 infection spreading, for two different conditions: (a) if lock down gets withdrawn and (b) if lock down continues as a whole. If the complete lock down in India is withdrawn on 14th April 2020, as a whole, then from the simulation, the authors have predicted that the infected population will flare-up to a large extent , suddenly, however, gradual or zone specific withdrawal would be more effective solution. This study also suggested some possible way-out to get rid of this situation by providing a trade-off between \u0022flattening of the curve\u0022 as well as less economic turbulence. The projections are intended to provide a base/ action plan for the socio-economic counter measures to alleviate nCOVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biswas, Swarnava; Mukherjee, Moumita","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ab454ee5185aade40b2bc051a2fea8d145ec9cb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060830","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of nCOVID","SEIR Model","comprehensive analysis of nCOVID","relentless spread nCOVID","direct person","optimistic mathematical model","infection","SEIR dynamics","authors","complete lock","study","determined parameters","direct route of transmission","day information","accessible day","Indian subcontinent","infected population","Indian States dependent","classical SEIR- type epidemic modelling framework","corona virus outbreak","days history of diseases","socio-economic counter measures","action plan","zone specific withdrawal","base","recuperation","large extent","flare-up","outburst","ordinary differential equations","effective solution","future patterns","nation-wide trends","beginning time","contamination cycle","situation","deaths","classes","prediction","different conditions","curve","trade-off","compartments","pandemic","economic turbulence","entire world","populace","projections","novelty","research","simulation","creators"],"language":"en"},

During the outbreak of a novel virus, estimating early a reliable ICU_ALOS estimate of infected patients is critical to accurately parameterize models examining mitigation and preparedness scenarios. Methods: Two estimation methods of ICU ALOS were compared: the average LOS of already discharged patients at the date of estimation (DPE), and a standard parametric method used for analyzing time-to-event data which fits a given distribution to observed data and includes the censored stays of patients still treated in the ICU at the date of estimation (CPE). Methods were compared on a series of all COVID-19 consecutive cases (n=59) admitted in an ICU devoted to such patients. At the last follow-up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. A simulation study investigated the generalizability of the methods\u0027 patterns. CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID-19 estimates reported to date. Findings: LOS [\u2265] 30 days concerned 14 out of the 59 patients (24%), including 8 of the 21 deaths observed. Two months after the first admission, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged, with corresponding DPE and CPE estimates of ICU_ALOS (95%CI) at 13.0 days (10.4, 15.6) and 23.1 days (18.1, 29.7), respectively. Series\u0027 true ICU_ALOS was greater than 21 days, well above reported estimates to date. Interpretation: Discharges of short stays are more likely observed earlier during the course of an outbreak. Cautious unbiased ICU_ALOS estimates suggest parameterizing a higher burden of ICU bed occupancy than that adopted to date in COVID-19 forecasting models.

Methods: This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Results: Forty-eight (20.6%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95% CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95% CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission. Conclusions: Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20%.

The coagulation function of the two groups (mild and severe) was compared. Compared with the mild group, majority of patients in the severe group were male (76.9% vs. 49.8%) and elderly (median age 65 vs. 50), and the proportion with chronic underlying diseases was higher (73.1% vs. 36.1%). There were 209 abnormalities (69.0%) of coagulation parameters in 303 patients admitted to hospital. Comparison of various indexes of coagulation function between the two groups in admission, the proportion of abnormal coagulation indicators in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group (100% vs. 66.1%). The median coagulation parameters in the severe group were higher than those in the mild group: international normalized ratio (1.04 vs. 1.01), prothrombin time (13.8 vs. 13.4) seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (43.2 vs. 39.2) seconds, fibrinogen (4.74 vs. 4.33) g/L, fibrinogen degradation products (2.61 vs. 0.99) \u00B5g/mL, and D-dimer (1.04 vs. 0.43) \u00B5g/mL, the differences were statistically significant (p \u003C 0.05).

Multiple studies suggest CT should be a primary diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) because they reported sensitivities with CT far superior to that of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. This review aimed to assess these reports and found chest CT to have a clinical utility that is limited, particularly for patients who show no symptoms and patients who are screened early in disease progression. CONCLUSION. CT has limited sensitivity for COVID-19 and a lower specificity than RT-PCR testing, and it carries a risk of exposing providers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

A collection of 295 bacterial isolates was constituted from droppings of capybara, alpaca, muntjac, zebra, tapir, rhinoceros, binturong, armadillo, saki monkey and cockatoo. Of 295 isolates, 51 exhibited antagonism against a panel of pathogenic target bacteria like Escherichia coli MC4100, Clostridium perfringens DSM 756 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Newport ATCC6962. Remarkably, within this collection, only 2 Gram-negative bacilli exhibited activity against E. coli MC4100 strain used as target organism. Then, the 16S rDNA sequencing revealed these thereafter cited species, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella cibaria, E. coli, Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus faecalis. Characterization of this antagonism has revealed 11 strains able producing extracellular protease-sensitive inhibitory compounds. These strains included E. coli ICVB442 and ICVB443, Ent. faecalis ICVB472, ICVB474, ICVB477 ICVB479, ICVB481, ICVB497 and ICVB501 and Ped. pentosaceus ICVB491 and ICVB492. The genomes of the 5 most promising bacteriocinogenic strains were sequenced and analysed with Bagel4 software. Afterwards, this bioinformatics analysis permitted to locate genes encoding bacteriocins like colicin Y (E. coli), enterocin 1071A, enterocin 107 B (Ent. faecalis) and penocin A (Ped. pentosaceus), associating the above-mentioned antibacterial activity of proteinaceous nature to possible production of bacteriocins.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In 24 German blackhead sheep, a surgically created gastroschisis was managed by fetoscopic placement of the extruded intestines into a bag. The bag was then fastened onto the fetal abdominal wall. Different materials (sterile gloves, latex condoms, laparosopic retrieval bags) and different fixation techniques (laparoscopic staplers, interrupted and continuous sutures) have been examined. The fetuses were retrieved and evaluated at the end of gestation. RESULTS Uterine bag insertion was successful in 15 of 24 (62.5%) and intestinal bag placement in 10 of 15 available fetuses (66.6%). The main factor limiting fetoscopic procedures was chorioamniotic separation (CAS). Sterilized condoms provided the most appropriate type of bags and the V-Loc\u2122 running suture, the most expedient type of fixation, which was achieved in 9 of the 10 fetuses (complete = 2, partially = 7) by using a three port access (5 mm and 2 \u00D7 3 mm).

However, none of these studies paid specific attention to the differences between the methods of accessing the bile duct during laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to report outcomes of transcystic versus transductal laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) from our experience of over four hundred cases. METHODS Retrospective review of 416 consecutive patients who underwent LCBDE at a single-centre between 1998 and 2018 was performed. Data collected included pre-operative demographic information, medical co-morbidity, pre-operative investigations, intra-operative findings (including negative choledochoscopy rates, use of holmium laser lithotripsy and operative time) and post-operative outcomes. RESULTS Transductal LCBDE via choledochotomy was achieved in 242 patients (58.2%), whereas 174 patients (41.8%) underwent transcystic LCBDE. Stone clearance rates, conversion to open surgery and mortality were similar between the two groups. Overall morbidity as well as minor and major post-operative complications were significantly higher in the transductal group. The main surgery-related complications were bile leak (5.8% vs 1.1%, p = 0.0181) and pancreatitis (7.4% vs 0.6%, p = 0.0005). Median length of post-operative stay was also significantly greater in the transductal group. CONCLUSION This study represents the largest single study to date comparing outcomes from transcystic and transductal LCBDE. Where possibly, the transcystic route should be used for LCBDE and this approach can be augmented with various techniques to increase successful stone clearance and reduce the need for choledochotomy.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Navaratne, Lalin; Martinez Isla, Alberto","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07522-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246237/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["post-operative outcomes","transcystic LCBDE","operative time","terms of post-operative morbidity","RESULTS Transductal LCBDE","major post-operative complications","pre-operative investigations","outcomes of transcystic","transductal group","intra-operative findings","pre-operative demographic information","Median length of post-operative stay","transcystic route","largest single study","transductal laparoscopic common bile duct exploration","Stone clearance rates","bile leak","Overall morbidity","single-centre","consecutive patients","studies","choledochotomy","vs","medical co-morbidity","successful stone clearance","open surgery","main surgery-related complications","significant differences","negative choledochoscopy rates","METHODS Retrospective review","concomitant gallstones","holmium laser lithotripsy","conversion","date","management of choledocholithiasis","mortality","various techniques","staged approaches","need","Data","specific attention","experience","CONCLUSION","groups","pancreatitis","laparoscopy","cases","BACKGROUND","aim"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed the yield of signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) during surveillance gastroscopy in CDH1 mutation carriers. METHODS : A retrospective analysis on surveillance gastroscopies in CDH1 mutation carriers was performed. The yield of SRCC in both targeted and random biopsies was studied. Endoscopic (biopsy) results were compared with the histopathologic outcomes in gastrectomy specimens. RESULTS : 42 CDH1 mutation carriers (18 men; mean age 43, range 20-82 years) underwent 96 surveillance gastroscopies. SRCC lesions were identified on surveillance gastroscopy in 21 patients (50 %), by either targeted biopsies only (n = 11), random biopsies only (n = 3), or both random and targeted biopsies (n = 7). SRCC was detected in 41 /377 targeted biopsies (11 %), whereas random biopsies revealed SRCC in 14/1563 biopsies (0.9 %). At least one SRCC lesion was found in 26 of 30 gastrectomy specimens. In 18 of these 26 specimens (69 %), SRCC had been identified by endoscopic biopsies. Missed lesions were all small superficial SRCC foci, mainly in the body of the stomach. CONCLUSION : In our cohort of CDH1 mutation carriers, SRCC lesions were identified by an extensive endoscopic surveillance protocol in 69 % of SRCC-positive patients who underwent a gastric resection. The low number of SRCC detected through random sampling demands a critical reappraisal of random biopsy sampling in the IGCLC guideline.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Dieren, Jolanda M; Kodach, Liudmila L; den Hartog, Peggy; van der Kolk, Lizet E; Sikorska, Karolina; van Velthuysen, Marie-Louise F; van Sandick, Johanna W; Koemans, Willem J; Snaebjornsson, Petur; Cats, Annemieke","journal":"Endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1157-8678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium","SRCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SRCC lesions","random biopsies","yield of SRCC","targeted biopsies","endoscopic biopsies","SRCC-positive patients","low number of SRCC","CDH1 germline mutation carriers","cohort of CDH1 mutation carriers","random sampling","surveillance gastroscopy","surveillance gastroscopies","small superficial SRCC foci","gastrectomy specimens","prophylactic gastrectomy","extensive endoscopic surveillance protocol","critical reappraisal of random biopsy sampling","gastric cancer development","IGCLC guideline","gastric resection","results","International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium","consensus guideline","yield of signet","early adulthood","ring cell carcinoma","psychosocial reasons","retrospective analysis","BACKGROUND","histopathologic outcomes","mean age","METHODS","body","CONCLUSION","years","stomach"],"language":"en"},

In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui\u0027an People\u0027s Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared. RESULTS Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, X-T; Luo, Y-L; Xia, S-C; Sun, Q-F; Ding, J-G; Zhou, Y; Chen, W; Wang, X-F; Zhang, W-W; Du, W-J; Ruan, Z-W; Hong, L","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OBJECTIVE The Coronavirus","LPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["test group","control group","body temperature of patients","proportion of patients","COVID","pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs","treatment of pneumonia","adjuvant medicine","combination treatment","evident therapeutic effect","changes of body temperature","clinical treatment","blood biochemistry","Blood routine indexes","day of treatment","use of LPV","better therapeutic effect","good therapeutic effect","Blood biochemical indexes","abnormal proportion of white blood cells","appropriate therapeutic scheme","groups","CONCLUSIONS","view","abnormal alanine aminotransferase","aspartate aminotransferase","lymphocytes","normal physiological mechanisms","C-reactive protein","nCoV-RNA","lopinavir","infection","admission","number of days","low cure rate","OBJECTIVE","Coronavirus disease","ritonavir","Rui\u0027an People\u0027s Hospital","METHODS","urgent need","effects","hospitalization","study","extent"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed the selective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this aim, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results indicated that most sites in the viral ORFs evolved under strong to moderate purifying selection. The most constrained sequences corresponded to some non-structural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein. Conversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a non-negligible proportion of codons evolving under very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection was detected. The 6 bona fide positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor still exists and which animals it infects. Our data however indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common ancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are dangerous zoonotic pathogens: in the last two decades three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused human epidemics. One of these is the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how, since its divergence from a closely related bat virus, natural selection shaped the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We found that distinct coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolve under different degrees of constraint and are consequently more or less prone to tolerate amino acid substitutions. In practical terms, the level of constraint provides indications about which proteins/protein regions are better suited as possible targets for the development of antivirals or vaccines. We also detected limited signals of positive selection in three viral ORFs. However, we warn that, in the absence of knowledge about the chain of events that determined the human spill-over, these signals should not be necessarily interpreted as evidence of an adaptation to our species.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00411-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["divergence of SARS","emerged SARS-CoV","genome of SARS","common ancestor of SARS","limited signals of positive selection","limited evidence of positive selection","BatCoV RaTG13 sequence","signal of positive selection","limited episodes of positive selection","weak purifying selection","moderate purifying selection","protein regions","viral ORFs","N protein","spike protein","human infection","ORF8","human epidemics","human spill","accessory ORFs","selective events","nsp1","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","level of constraint","bat origin","non-structural proteins","RBM similar","population variation","species barrier","chain of events","selective neutrality","selected sites","previous data","pangolin viruses","distinct coding regions","different degrees of constraint","related bat virus","population genetics-phylogenetics approach","dangerous zoonotic pathogens","indications","non-negligible proportion of codons","possible targets","development of antivirals","receptor-binding motif","recombination event","amino acid substitutions","practical terms","constrained sequences","decades","nsps","outgroup","novel coronavirus","absence of knowledge","horseshoe bats","vaccines","line","aim","adaptation","animals","Results","China"],"language":"en"},

Although there are ongoing clinical trials of repurposed and investigational antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are as yet no scientifically proven, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy. Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined. Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses. Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations. Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts. Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abena, Pascale M; Decloedt, Eric H; Bottieau, Emmanuel; Suleman, Fatima; Adejumo, Prisca; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Muyembe TamFum, Jean-Jacques; Seydi, Moussa; Eholie, Serge P; Mills, Edward J; Kallay, Oscar; Zumla, Alimuddin; Nachega, Jean B","journal":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32323646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CQ/HCQ"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["HCQ use","safety of CQ","label CQ","approved COVID","treatment of COVID","widespread use of CQ","countries vulnerable","African countries","pandemic","efficacy","used antimalarials chloroquine","hydroxychloroquine","ongoing clinical trials of repurposed","low-cost distribution","cases of novel coronavirus disease","lack of randomized clinical trials","extensive shortages","repurposed drugs","safety issues","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","focus of global scientific","existing global aid efforts","investigational antiviral","coordinated production","falsified medical products","political attention","cross-continental collaborative network","post-marketing surveillance","increased market prices","media","immune-based therapies","self-treatment","Indiscriminate promotion","laboratory","fatal overdoses","therapy","prescription monitoring schemes","healthcare system limitations","effective pharmacological treatments","essential medicine","autoimmune diseases","years"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated whether ambulance dispatch calls of highest urgency reflect the circulation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenzavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). METHODS We analysed calls from four ambulance call centres serving 25% of the population in the Netherlands (2014-2016). The chief symptom and urgency level is recorded during triage; we restricted our analysis to calls with the highest urgency and identified those compatible with a respiratory syndrome. We modelled the relation between respiratory syndrome calls (RSC) and respiratory virus trends using binomial regression with identity link function. RESULTS We included 211 739 calls, of which 15 385 (7.3%) were RSC. Proportion of RSC showed periodicity with winter peaks and smaller interseasonal increases. Overall, 15% of RSC were attributable to respiratory viruses (20% in out-of-office hour calls). There was large variation by age group: in \u003C15 years, only RSV was associated and explained 11% of RSC; in 15-64 years, only influenza A (explained 3% of RSC); and in \u226565 years adenovirus explained 9% of RSC, distributed throughout the year, and hMPV (4%) and influenza A (1%) mainly during the winter peaks. Additionally, rhinovirus was associated with total RSC. CONCLUSION High urgency ambulance dispatches reflect the burden of different respiratory viruses and might be useful to monitor the respiratory season overall. Influenza plays a smaller role than other viruses: RSV is important in children while adenovirus and hMPV are the biggest contributors to emergency calls in the elderly.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monge, Susana; Duijster, Janneke; Kommer, Geert Jan; van de Kassteele, Jan; Krafft, Thomas; Engelen, Paul; Valk, Jens P; de Waard, Jan; de Nooij, Jan; Riezebos-Brilman, Annelies; van der Hoek, Wim; van Asten, Liselotte","journal":"Influenza and other respiratory viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410358/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","RSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory syndrome calls","respiratory season","Proportion of RSC","total RSC","respiratory virus trends","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza B virus","burden of different respiratory viruses","RSV","highest urgency","circulation of influenza","hMPV","years adenovirus","office hour calls","urgency level","syndromic surveillance of severe respiratory infections","CONCLUSION High urgency ambulance dispatches","BACKGROUND Ambulance dispatches","rhinovirus","winter peaks","smaller role","smaller interseasonal increases","binomial regression","parainfluenzavirus","periodicity","identity link function","coronavirus","children","human metapneumovirus","biggest contributors","age group","emergency","relation","large variation","chief symptom","triage","analysis","centres","population","elderly","METHODS","Netherlands"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Between December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020, 23 hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms. Descriptive analysis and correlation of patients\u0027 clinical and CT characteristics were performed. Laboratory results from time of first admission and CT absorption (defined as reduction in lesion area, decrease in density, and absorption of some solid components) were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. RESULTS Fifteen (65.2%) patients were asymptomatic with patchy ground-glass opacity in a single lung lobe. Eight (34.8%) patients were symptomatic with multiple patchy ground-glass shadows, consolidation, and fibrous stripes. Differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate between first admission and CT absorption were significant (P\u003C0.001). Median absorption time was shorter in the asymptomatic group compared with the symptomatic group (5 vs 10 days; P\u003C0.001). Median hospitalization time between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 14 vs 25.5 days; P\u003E0.001.

CONCLUSION Radiological findings and clinical characteristics in pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization in asymptomatic patients were significantly shorter than in symptomatic patients.

Findings could serve as a roadmap for further investigations and potentially inform efforts to prevent physician suicide. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched for English-language publications from August 21, 2017 through April 28, 2018. Inclusion criteria were a primary outcome or thesis focused on suicide (including suicide completion, attempts, and thoughts or ideation) among medical students, postgraduate trainees, or attending physicians. Opinion articles were included. Studies that were non-English, or those that only mentioned physician burnout, mental health or substance use disorders were excluded. Data extraction was performed by two authors. Results: The search yielded 1,596 articles, of which 347 articles passed to the full-text review round. The oldest article was an editorial from 1903; 210 (60.3%) articles were published from 2000 to present. Authors originated from 37 countries and 143 (41.2%) were opinion articles. Most discussed were suicide risk factors and culture of practice issues, while least discussed themes included public health and postvention. Conclusions: Consistency and reliability of data and information about physician suicides could be improved. Data limitations partly contribute to these issues. Also, various suicide risk factors for physicians have been explored, and several remain poorly understood. Based on this scoping review, a public health approach, including surveillance and early warning systems, investigations of sentinel cases, and postvention may be impactful next steps in preventing physician deaths by suicide.","publish_time":"2019-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, T.

The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the region was reported on February 14, but what lies ahead in terms of the course and magnitude of infection remains speculative. To the best of our knowledge, no study, using a robust methodology, provides the immediate and long-term trajectory of COVID-19 for the entire region or accounts for its local context. This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide estimates on how many people would contract the virus and how many would die in the coming few months across Africa. Methods: The forecasts on caseloads and incidences are from a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression model. Fatality rates from Italy and China were further applied to generate mortality estimates after adjustments were made for differences in age-structure, health service quality, and living standards between each of the African countries and those of the reference population. We cover all countries that reported a confirmed case as of March 31, 2020. Results: By the end of June, 16,283,085 people will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to 98, 358, 799). With a cumulative caseload of 5,413,4517 (95% CI 1,332,953 to 8,489,940) and 906,625 (95% CI 173, 821 to 4,742,917) Northern and Eastern Africa will respectively be the most and least affected sub-regions in the continent. Cumulative COVID-19 cases on June 30, 2020 are expected to reach 2,912, 864 (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2,787, 913 (95% CI 517, 489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1,185,742 (95% CI 229, 111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. New infections (incidence) for the month of April are expected to be the highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco 1045 (95% CI 167 to 6,547) will register the highest number of deaths. Conclusion: Our study shows that countries that are least urbanized and have a low level of socio-economic development, hence least connected to the outside world, are likely to register lower and slower transmissions, at least at the early stage of the epidemic. However, the same set of enabling factors that worked for their benefit are likely to go against them in implementing interventions that have lessened the impact of the disease elsewhere.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kinfu, Y.; Alam, U.; Achoki, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aca748230b163c9105c9a9b2f3ca97a096badb9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.09.20059154v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Africa","Eastern Africa","Southern Africa","Western Africa","Central Africa"],"keyphrases":["confirmed COVID","Cumulative COVID","Eastern Africa","Southern Africa","Western Africa","Central Africa","long-term trajectory of COVID","entire region","major region","study","African countries","confirmed case","people","mortality estimates","cumulative caseload","highest number of deaths","co-variate","age-structure","health service quality","differences","standards","instrumental variable regression model","slower transmissions","course","China","caseloads","low level of socio-economic development","incidences","adjustments","accounts","magnitude of infection","early stage","outside world","robust methodology","local context","affected sub-regions","continent","Fatality rates","Italy","forecasts","systematic attempt","SARS-CoV","New infections","reference population","impact","factors","paper","Methods","epidemic","terms","end","benefit","best","knowledge","Background","Conclusion","cases","interventions","disease","set","Results","Djibouti","virus","pandemic","months","Morocco"],"language":"en"},

We also aim to provide a searchable database to enable relevant stakeholders to compare between platforms. Study Design and Setting Preprint platforms that were launched up to 25th June 2019 and have a biomedical and medical scope according to MEDLINE\u2019s journal selection criteria were identified using existing lists, web-based searches and the expertise of both academic and non-academic publication scientists. A data extraction form was developed, pilot-tested and used to collect data from each preprint platform\u2019s webpage(s). Data collected were in relation to scope and ownership; content-specific characteristics and information relating to submission, journal transfer options, and external discoverability; screening, moderation, and permanence of content; usage metrics and metadata. Where possible, all online data were verified by the platform owner or representative by correspondence. Results A total of 44 preprint platforms were identified as having biomedical and medical scope, 17 (39%) were hosted by the Open Science Framework preprint infrastructure, six (14%) were provided by F1000 Research Ltd (the Open Research Central infrastructure) and 21 (48%) were other independent preprint platforms. Preprint platforms were either owned by non-profit academic groups, scientific societies or funding organisations (n=28; 64%), owned/partly owned by for-profit publishers or companies (n=14; 32%) or owned by individuals/small communities (n=2; 5%). Twenty-four (55%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journal\u2019s remit. Thirty-three (75%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. The three most common screening checks related to the scope of the article, plagiarism and legal/ethical/societal issues and compliance. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer-reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read-access, and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service. Forty-one (93%) platforms currently have usage metrics, with the most common metric being the number of downloads presented on the abstract page. Conclusion A large number of preprint platforms exist for use in biomedical and medical sciences, all of which offer researchers an opportunity to rapidly disseminate their research findings onto an open-access public server, subject to scope and eligibility. However, the process by which content is screened before online posting and withdrawn or removed after posting varies between platforms, which may be associated with platform operation, ownership, governance and financing. What is already known on this topic In concurrence with an increase in the number of preprint servers and platforms supporting biomedical and medical sciences research since 2013, there has been substantial growth in the number of preprints posted in this research area. The significant benefits of accelerated dissemination of research that preprints offer has attracted the support of many major funders. The raised profile of preprints has led to their wider acceptance in institutional and individual level assessment. What this study adds This is the first full examination of the characteristics and policies of 44 preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope. We use a robust methodological approach to extract relevant information from web-based material with input from preprint platform owners. Despite concerns regarding the permanence and quality of preprints, most preprint platforms have long-term preservation strategies and many have screening checks (for example, a basic check for the relevance of content) in place. For some platforms, these checks are performed by researchers with content expertise. We provide a searchable database as a valuable resource for researchers, funders and policymakers in the biomedical and medical science field to determine which preprint platforms are relevant to their research scope and which have the functionality and policies that they value most.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirkham, Jamie J; Penfold, Naomi; Murphy, Fiona; Boutron, Isabelle; Ioannidis, John PA; Polka, Jessica K; Moher, David","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29b78d7ee4606831cc5107b87004ebd4adfaec75.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.063578","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Design","MEDLINE","Open Science Framework","F1000 Research Ltd","Open Research Central"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["independent preprint platforms","large number of preprint platforms","medical scope","number of preprint servers","preprint platform owners","preprint platform\u2019s webpage","medical sciences research","Open Science Framework preprint infrastructure","research findings","F1000 Research","number of preprints","research area","article screening","Open Research Central infrastructure","screening process","online data","content-specific characteristics","common screening checks","number of downloads","permanence of content","relevant information","submission","significant benefits of accelerated dissemination of research","platform operation","ownership","policies","usage metrics","key characteristics","data extraction form","use","offer","online posting","open-access public server","web-based material","journal transfer options","web-based searches","peer-reviewed journal","raised profile of preprints","MEDLINE\u2019s journal selection criteria","scientific societies","context expertise","funding source","funding organisations","relevant stakeholders","scientific fields","common metric","basic checks","involved researchers","Study Design","non-profit academic groups","non-academic publication scientists","geographical region","existing lists","external discoverability","subject","input","details","wider acceptance","plagiarism","moderation","increase","individual level assessment","societal issues","affiliated journal\u2019s remit","robust methodological approach","retraction","restrictions","governance","Conclusion","preservation plan","sustainability","reasons","compliance","support","policy","financing","searchable database","for-profit publishers","companies","individuals","small communities","representative","correspondence","pilot","concurrence","eligibility","opportunity","substantial growth","metadata","relation","abstract page","major funders","service","Objectives","topic","examination","total","preprint platforms","researchers","screening checks","relevance of content","content expertise","policymakers","long-term preservation strategies","valuable resource","medical science field","funders","quality of preprints","basic check","research scope","example","functionality","permanence","concerns","place"],"language":"en"},

The rotation rate Omega under consideration is equivalent to the rotational Reynolds number Re=Omegab2/nu=9.5 x 104, where nu is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. This corresponds to a value at which an experiment carried out at the laboratory has shown that the stator boundary layer is turbulent, whereas the rotor boundary layer is still laminar. Comparisons of the 3D computed solution with velocity measurements have given good agreement for the mean and turbulent fields. The results enhance evidence of weak turbulence at this Reynolds number, by comparing the turbulence properties with available data in the literature. An approximately self-similar boundary layer behavior is observed along the stator side. The reduction of the structural parameter a1 under the typical value 0.15 and the variation in the wall-normal direction of the different characteristic angles show that this boundary layer is three-dimensional. A quadrant analysis of conditionally averaged velocities is performed to identify the contributions of different events (ejections and sweeps) on the Reynolds shear stress producing vortical structures. The asymmetries observed in the conditionally averaged quadrant analysis are dominated by Reynolds stress-producing events in this B\\\u0022{o}dewadt layer. Moreover, case 1 vortices (with a positive wall induced velocity) are found to be the major source of generation of special strong events, in agreement with the conclusions of Lygren and Andersson.","publish_time":"2006-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randriamampianina, Anthony; Poncet, S\u0027ebastien","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0607097v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Andersson"],"organizations":["Reynolds"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stator boundary layer","rotor boundary layer","Reynolds stress","dewadt layer","self-similar boundary layer behavior","rotational Reynolds number","Reynolds shear stress","turbulent flow","turbulent fields","contributions of different events","averaged quadrant analysis","special strong events","enclosed annular rotor-stator cavity","good agreement","velocity measurements","turbulence properties","positive wall induced velocity","laboratory study","typical value","averaged velocities","different characteristic angles","D computed solution","wall-normal direction","evidence of weak turbulence","small radius ratio","large aspect ratio G","consideration","sweeps","rotating disk","outer radii","structural parameter a1","variation","ejections","major source of generation","direct numerical simulation","rotation rate Omega","vortices","available data","mean","vortical structures","Omegab2","conclusions of Lygren","literature","reduction","kinematic viscosity","interdisk","results","Comparisons","fluid","Andersson","case","experiment","asymmetries"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in COVID-19 patients with death or survival. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19 using a fixed or random-effects model. Results: In the meta-analysis of 18 studies, which included a total of 2,862 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 30.9 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients with death and 26.3 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients discharged alive (p \u003C 0.0001). The pooled mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 45.3 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients with death while 30.1 IU/L in the patients discharged alive (p \u003C 0.0001). Compared with the discharged alive cases, the dead cases tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time, and international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction.

Methods: We retrospectively analysed the management and 28-day outcomes of 316 consecutive adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large NHS Foundation Trust with a tertiary High Consequence Infectious Diseases centre in the North of England. Findings: Most patients were elderly (median age 75) with multiple comorbidities. One quarter were admitted from residential or nursing care. Symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, with cough, fever and/or breathlessness in 90.5% of patients. Two thirds of patients had severe disease on admission. Mortality was 81/291 (27.8%). Most deaths were anticipated; decisions to initiate respiratory support were individualised after consideration of patient wishes, premorbid frailty and comorbidities, with specialist palliative care input where appropriate. 22/291 (7.6%) patients were intubated and 11/22 (50%) survived beyond discharge.

Despite efforts to carefully monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported number of confirmed cases is likely to underestimate the actual number of infections. We aim to estimate the total number of COVID-19 infections in a straightforward manner using a demographic scaling approach based on life tables. Methods: We use data on total number of COVID-19 attributable deaths, population counts, and life tables as well as information on infection fatality rates as reported in Verity et al. (2020) for Hubei, China. We develop a scaling approach based on life tables and remaining life expectancy to map infection fatality rates between two countries to account for differences in their age structure, health status, and the health care system. The scaled infection fatality rates can be used in combination with COVID-19 attributable deaths to calculate estimates of the total number of infected. We also introduce easy to apply formulas to quantify the bias that would be required in death counts and infection fatality rates in order to reproduce a certain estimate of infections. Findings: Across the 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of April 17, 2020, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 4 times the number of confirmed cases. The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval suggests on average twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound 10 times as many. Country-specific variation is high. For Italy, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 1 million, or almost 6 times the number of confirmed cases. For the U.S., our estimate of 1.4 million is close to being twice as large as the number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 3 million is more than 4 times the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infected is only 1.2 times (upper bound: 3 times) than the number of confirmed cases. Comparing our results with findings from local seroprevalence studies and applying our bias formulas shows that some of their infection estimates would only be possible if just a small fraction of COVID-19 related deaths were recorded, indicating that these seroprevalence estimates might not be representative for the total population. Interpretation: As many countries lack population based seroprevalence studies, straightforward demographic adjustment can be used to deliver useful estimates of the total number of infected cases. Our results imply that the total number COVID-19 cases may be approximately 4 times (95%: 2 to 10 times) that of the confirmed cases. Although these estimates are uncertain and vary across countries, they indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is much more broadly spread than what confirmed cases would suggest, and the number of asymptomatic cases or cases with mild symptoms may be high. In cases in which estimates from local seroprevalence studies or from simulation models exist, our approach can provide a simple benchmark to assess the quality of those estimates.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bohk-Ewald, C.; Dudel, C.; Myrskyla, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e73907c4e4d1dfd0a4dcdab2ef1f8fdd12b6ab4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077719v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","U.S."],"keyphrases":["total number of COVID","total number COVID","total number of infected cases","number of asymptomatic cases","reported number of confirmed cases","times","actual number of infections","infection estimates","total population","seroprevalence estimates","useful estimates","small fraction of COVID","life tables","scaled infection fatality rates","certain estimate of infections","local seroprevalence studies","attributable deaths","pandemic","countries lack population","related deaths","demographic scaling approach","remaining life expectancy","results","bias formulas","Findings","straightforward demographic adjustment","straightforward manner","health status","critical information","death counts","health care system","order","decision makers","simulation models","mild symptoms","combination","age structure","implications","progress","differences","Verity","data","prediction interval","Country-specific variation","simple benchmark","average","quality","Interpretation","Background","policy options","testing","Hubei","Methods","Germany","China","uncertainty","Italy","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Limited understanding about epidemics can lead to panic and disrupt public health efforts to contain transmission. It is important to understand perceptions of the population regarding the disease. This study reports results of a survey designed to understand attitudes and knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 virus among Georgian population, including health care workers (HCWs). Materials and methods The online survey was conducted using a Facebook advertisement. The target was the whole country and the language used was Georgian. We collected information on demographic data, knowledge of the disease, including perceived differences between coronavirus and influenza. We also included questions to capture the populations perceptions about government preparedness to combat the new coronavirus. Results The survey was open for three days (March 2-4, 2020). 5228 participants completed the survey. Of these, 40.3% were 25-45 years old, 58.2% were female, 20.7% had university degree and 10.3% were HCWs. For 25.8% of respondents, COVID-19 and influenza are the same diseases; 10.9% did not know if they are different. The majority correctly identified the transmission route and symptoms (96.9% and 98.0%, respectively). 19.1% think that Georgia is ready for COVID 19 epidemic, while according to 55% the county is not ready, but HCWs are trying hard to respond properly. For 18% response is inadequate. There was no difference in knowledge between HCWs, non-HCWs and unemployed. 20% of HCWs as well as other study subjects believe that SARS-COV-2 vaccine and medications do exist but are simply not available in Georgia. Conclusion Given that information regarding coronavirus is changing very rapidly, the need to reach people with time-sensitive educational messages as well as prevention strategies is vital.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butsashvili, M.; Gulbiani, L.; Kanchelashvili, G.; Kochlamazashvili, M.; Nioradze, G.; Kamkamidze, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4271eea047644586b4d4996b5cc8c96cebb19eda.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101642v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Introduction Georgia"],"locations":["Georgia"],"keyphrases":["non-HCWs","SARS-COV","knowledge","online survey","Georgian population","case of SARS","new coronavirus","influenza","information","COVID","Introduction Georgia","study reports results","populations perceptions","study subjects","transmission route","health care workers","public health efforts","time-sensitive educational messages","people","panic","government preparedness","prevention strategies","perceived differences","female","demographic data","attitudes","epidemics","country","Materials","methods","university degree","vaccine","Limited understanding","Facebook advertisement","years old","need","majority","symptoms","language","questions","medications","days","respondents","Conclusion","infection","county","response","total","cases","target","diseases","participants"],"language":"en"},

The player base is extremely diverse - for instance, two top players are a 40 year old female accountant and a male taxi driver.

Interestingly, female players tended to perform better than male players, even though men played more games per day. To understand this relationship, we explore the profiles of our top players in more depth.

In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named COVID-19) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve health activity during pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Indini, Alice; Aschele, Carlo; Bruno, Daniele; Cavanna, Luigi; Clerico, Mario; Fiorentini, Giammaria; Fioretto, Luisa; Giordano, Monica; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Ortega, Cinzia; Pinotti, Graziella; Scanni, Alberto; Zamagni, Claudio; Blasi, Livio; Grossi, Francesco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d14da333bb8dc75ec869200ade23bf5e60e9329c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920301659; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920301659?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["risk of COVID","national survey","impact of COVID","triage of patients","health activity","oncologic patients","Italian oncology departments","implementation of containment measures of COVID","CIPOMO","Italy","national territory","national basis","pandemic","Results","Italian association of head physicians","public health services","global health problem","clinical activity of oncologists","following measures","novel disease entity","well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici","hospital","potential harm","important starting point","benefit","significant hurdle","delay of non-urgent visits","affected nations","proactive approach","International cooperation","SARSCoV","protective devices","homogeneous distribution","research activities","China","example","actual emergency","epidemic","continuum of care","ways","diffusion","end of year","country","telemedicine","midst","Europe","infection"],"language":"en"},

Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. Objective: To describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study of electronic health records Setting: 13-hospital network spanning the state of New Jersey. Participants: Patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was death. Results: Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. Conclusions: This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution while awaiting results of randomized trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ip, A.; Berry, D.

Live voting at polls was allowed despite concern over increasing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to 1.1 million absentee ballots cast, 453,222 persons voted live. The purpose of our study was to determine if an increase in COVID-19 activity was associated with the election. Methods: Using the voting age population for the United States (US), WI, and its 3 largest counties, and daily new COVID-19 case reports from various COVID-19 web-based dashboards, daily new case rates were calculated. With election day April 7, the incubation period included April 12-21. The new case activity in the rest of the US was compared with the Wisconsin activity during the incubation period. Results: WI daily new case rates were lower than those of the rest of the US for the 10-day period before the election and remained lower during the post exposure incubation period. The ratio of Wisconsin new case rates to US new case rates was 0.34 WI: 1 US for the 10 days leading up to the election and declined to 0.28 WI: 1 US for the 10-day post-incubation period after the election. Similar analysis for Milwaukee county showed a pre-election ratio of 1.02 Milwaukee: 1 US and after the election the ratio was 0.63 Milwaukee: 1 US. Dane county had a pre-election ratio of 0.21 Dane: 1 US case, and it fell to 0.13 Dane: 1 US after the election. Waukesha county had a pre-election ratio of 0.27 Waukesha: 1 US case and that fell to 0.19 Waukesha: 1 US after the election.

Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Aaron; Reandelar, Mac Josh; Fasciglione, Kimberly; Roumenova, Violeta; Li, Yan; Otazu, Gonzalo H","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f2833b379b31e6937a2f55febe2b3851393282a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["universal policies of BCG vaccination","long-standing BCG policies","large number of countries BCG vaccination policies","different countries","childhood vaccination","late start of universal BCG policy","number of reported COVID","different national policies respect","national differences","high mortality","impact","combination of reduced morbidity","Bacillus Calmette-Guerin","potential new tool","mitigation efforts","idea","Iran","Italy","cultural norms","fight","cases","Nederland","disease","vaccinated elderly population","health infrastructure","broad protection","respiratory infections","USA","country","world"],"language":"en"},

Clinical characteristics that impact disease course could offer guidance for clinical decision making and future research endeavors and unveil disease pathways. Objective: To examine risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data sources: We performed a systematic review in PubMed from January 1 until April 19, 2020. Study selection: Observational studies that examined the association of any clinical characteristic with an adverse clinical outcome were considered eligible. We scrutinized studies for potential overlap. Data extraction and synthesis: Information on the effect of clinical factors on clinical endpoints of patients with COVID-19 was independently extracted by two researchers. When an effect size was not reported, crude odds ratios were calculated based on the available information from the eligible articles. Study-specific effect sizes from non-overlapping studies were synthesized applying the random-effects model. Main outcome and measure: The examined outcomes were severity and progression of disease, admission to ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, mortality, or a composite outcome. Results: We identified 88 eligible articles, and we performed a total of 256 meta-analyses on the association of 98 unique risk factors with five clinical outcomes. Seven meta-analyses presented the strongest epidemiological evidence in terms of statistical significance (P-value \u003C0.005), between-study heterogeneity (I2 \u003C50%), sample size (more than 1000 COVID-19 patients), 95% prediction interval excluded the null value, and absence of small-study effects.

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

Here we show that IFN signalling interferes with lung repair during influenza recovery, with IFN-\u03BB driving these effects most potently. IFN-induced p53 directly reduces epithelial proliferation and differentiation, increasing disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial superinfections. Hence, excessive or prolonged IFN-production aggravates viral infection by impairing lung epithelial regeneration.

The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, and whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scheen, Andr\u00E9 J.; Marre, Michel; Thivolet, Charles","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71f9b37a8aa0da359c28ddc310861ec9a926f85d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363620300859; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363620300859?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","China"],"keyphrases":["risk of COVID","outcomes of COVID","non-diabetes patients","hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes","non-hospitalized diabetes patients","prevalence of diabetes patients","risk of death","risk factors of progression","major risk factor","quality of glucose control","Abstract Diabetes mellitus","serious life-threatening COVID","poor outcomes","impact of glucose control","quality of past glucose control","prognostic factors","CORONADO study","infection","respiratory assistance","related observations","impaired respiratory mechanics","main findings of CORONADO","prospective observational study","independent influence","increased body mass index","presence","macrovascular complications","use of RAAS blockers","intensive care units","comorbidities","example","DPP","inhibitors","inappropriate inflammatory responses","hospitalization","negative signs","time of hospital admission","mortality rate","countries","France","context","brief review","old age","China","ectopic fat deposits","Hyperglycaemia","issue","addition","marker of severity","population","pandemic","obesity","specific investigation"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies established the impact of population outflow from Wuhan on the spatial spread of coronavirus in China and hinted the impact of the other three mobility patterns, i.e., population outflow from Hubei province excluding Wuhan, population inflow from cities outside Hubei, and intra-city population movement. However, the overall impact of all mobility patterns, or the impact of the different timing of mobility restriction intervention, are not systematically analyzed. Here we apply the cumulative confirmed cases and mobility data of 350 Chinese cities outside Hubei to explore the relationships between all mobility patterns and epidemic spread, and estimate the impact of local travel restrictions, both in terms of level and timing, on the epidemic control based on mobility change. The relationships were identified by using Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multivariable linear regression, while scenario simulation was used to estimate the mobility change caused by local travel restrictions. Our analysis shows that: (1) all mobility patterns correlated with the spread of the coronavirus in Chinese cities outside Hubei, while the corrleations droppd with the implemetation of travel restrictions; (2) the cumulative confirmed cases in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown was mainly brought by three patterns of inter-city population movement, while those in the third and fourth weeks after was significantly influenced by the number of intra-city population movement; (3) the local travel restrictions imposed by cities outside Hubei have averted 1,960 (95%PI: 1,474-2,447) more infections, taking 22.4% (95%PI: 16.8%-27.9%) of confirmed ones, in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, while more synchronized implementation would further decrease the number of confirmed cases in the same period by 15.7% (95%PI:15.4%-16.0%) or 1,378 (95%PI: 1,353-1,402) cases; and (4) local travel restrictions on different mobility patterns have different degrees of protection on cities with or without initial confirmed cases until the Wuhan lockdown. Our results prove the effectiveness of local travel restrictions and highlight the importance of synchronized implementation of mobility control across cities in mitigating the COVID-19 transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, H.; Bai, X.; Shen, H.; Pang, X.; Liang, Z.; Liu, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44f53741c57e2fa42d3bd9dc174e86fbb2bd4dc3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.02.20050781v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["different mobility patterns","mobility change","mobility data","impact of local travel restrictions","Mobility control measures","effectiveness of local travel restrictions","impact of population outflow","implemetation of travel restrictions","Chinese cities","importance of synchronized implementation of mobility control","Wuhan lockdown","number of confirmed cases","cumulative confirmed cases","patterns of inter-city population movement","initial confirmed cases","different timing of mobility restriction intervention","population inflow","number of intra-city population movement","Hubei province","overall impact","confirmed ones","weeks","epidemic control","epidemic spread","spatial spread of coronavirus","COVID","relationships","different degrees of protection","crucial importance","Pearson correlation analysis","stepwise multivariable linear regression","public health planning","scenario simulation","corrleations droppd","terms of level","China","Previous studies","results","period","pandemic","transmission","infections"],"language":"en"},

As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS CoV 2. Methods and findings We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions. Conclusions Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID 19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahapatra, Sovesh; Nath, Prathul; Chatterjee, Manisha; Das, Neeladrisingha; Kalita, Deepjyoti; Roy, Partha; Satapathi, Soumitra","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd0755d16f09d8cfaef4774a6414f9afd0b60397.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of drugs","drug discovery","effective drugs","new virus","treatment of COVID","repurposing of therapeutic agents","commercial drugs","existing drugs","various new drug combinations","antiretroviral drug Atazanavir","drug development process","epidemic disease","clinical scientists","detailed study","active therapeutic agents","novel coronavirus disease COVID","futuristic smart drug designing strategy","clinical trials","clinical recovery","SARS-CoV","SARS CoV","based approach","possible treatment regimens","urgent requirement of new","virus infected cases","effective medications","protocols","computational power","community applications","advancements","DrugBank ID DB01072","mortality rate","Machine Learning","vast complexity","outbreak","words","Naive Bayes algorithm","remarkable improvements","model","globe","diseases","limited time","selected criterions","vaccines","findings","FDA","Conclusions","months","market","accuracy","technology","researchers","world","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, none of the HDV-like agents were found in co-infection with an HBV-like agent suggesting that these viruses use different helper virus(es). Here we show, using snake deltavirus (SDeV), that HBV represents only a single example of helper viruses for deltaviruses. We cloned the SDeV genome into a mammalian expression plasmid, and by transfection could initiate SDeV replication in cultured snake and mammalian cells. By superinfecting SDeV infected cells with arenaviruses, or by transfecting different viral surface proteins, we could induce infectious SDeV particle production. Our findings indicate that deltaviruses can likely use a multitude of helper viruses or even viral glycoproteins to form infectious particles. Persistent and recurrent infections would be beneficial for the spread of deltaviruses.

Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patient long-term survival. Methods: We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017. We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of disruption of one year and two years. Using healthcare resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life years gained from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations. Findings: Per year, 94,912 resections for major cancers result in 80,406 long-term survivors and 1,717,051 life years gained. Per-patient delay of six months would cause attributable death of 10,555 of these individuals with loss of 205,024 life years. For cancer surgery, average life years gained (LYGs) per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 15.9 with a delay of six months (a loss of 2.3 LYG per patient). Taking into account units of healthcare resource (HCRU), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 1.98 RALYGs following delay of six months. For 94,912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 474,505 LYGs requiring of 1,097,937 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.0 LYG and 0.43 RALYGs. Interpretation: Delay of six months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 43% of life years gained by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community acquired COVID-19. This rises to 62% when considering resource-adjusted life-years gained. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.

The way in which the virus has been dispersed in Brazil, and more specifically in Rio de Janeiro, is the motivation of the present work. Our studies consist of analyzing temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in the municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro and in the neighborhoods of the state capital, based on open data published by the Health Departments of Governments of the State of RJ and the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, covering the period from February 27, 2020 to April 27, 2020. For that, we use analysis of time evolution graphs and mappings of spatial distributions and statistics analysis of spatial correlation. Our results suggest that the initial stages of spreading the virus across the state occur exponentially, with specific regions with a higher concentration of rates of cases, deaths and recovered people. In addition, our qualitative and quantitative results, for the data considered, point out that the regions with the highest income average per capita have higher rates of confirmed cases and recovered people, however, the regions of higher lethality do not are found in these places, with several of these regions of high lethality in places of low income per capita.

Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and CD209L, are particularly interesting because they directly recognize a plethora of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Both genes, which result from an ancient duplication, possess a neck region, made up of seven repeats of 23 amino acids each, known to play a major role in the pathogen-binding properties of these proteins. To explore the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on these innate immunity genes, we resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of repeats of the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome Diversity Panel for both genes. Our results, which are based on diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and neck-region length variation, provide genetic evidence that CD209 has been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations. In addition, our data point to the neck region as the functional target of such selective pressures: CD209 presents a constant size in the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presents an excess of length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree, whose binary topology and time depth (\u223C2.8 million years ago) are compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa. Altogether, our study has revealed that even a short segment of the human genome can uncover an extraordinarily complex evolutionary history, including different pathogen pressures on host genes as well as traces of admixture among archaic hominid populations.","publish_time":"2005-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barreiro, Luis B.; Patin, Etienne; Neyrolles, Olivier; Cann, Howard M.; Gicquel, Brigitte; Quintana-Murci, Llu\u00EDs","journal":"The American Journal of Human Genetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fa6a89af06e588d737c868cdcebceaee14d7532.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002929707633667; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707633667","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Genome Diversity Panel"],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa","Europe","East Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["neck-region length variation","neck region populationwide","innate immunity genes","host genes","selective pressures","non-African populations","innate immunity system","different pathogen pressures","CD209L variability","excess of length variation","plethora of pathogens","coalescent-based CD209 gene tree","population genetic distances","strong selective constraint","archaic hominid populations","entire Human Genome Diversity Panel","genetic evidence","diversity levels","sub-Saharan Africa","number of repeats","amino acids","pathogen-binding properties","ancestral population structure","amino acid changes","line of host defense","additional interesting observation","binary topology","constant size","accumulation","neutrality tests","complex evolutionary history","traces of admixture","functional target","Europe","action of balancing selection","time depth","bacteria","data point","group of samples","East Asia","major role","short segment","ancient duplication","years","proteins","viruses","parasites","extent","study","results"],"language":"en"},

However, the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. Methods Data of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases before January 23, 2020 were collected from medical records, epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province during 2002-2003 were obtained from Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GDCDC). Exponential Growth (EG) and maximum likelihood estimation (ML) were applied to estimate the reproductive number (R) of 2019-nCoV and SARS. Findings As of January 23, 2020, a total of 830 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases were identified across China, and 9 cases were reported overseas. The average incubation duration of 2019-nCoV infection was 4.8days. The average period from onset of symptoms to isolation of 2019-nCoV and SARS cases were 2.9 and 4.2 days, respectively. The R values of 2019-nCoV were 2.90 (95%CI: 2.32-3.63) and 2.92 (95%CI: 2.28-3.67) estimated using EG and ML respectively, while the corresponding R values of SARS-CoV were 1.77 (95%CI: 1.37-2.27) and 1.85 (95%CI: 1.32-2.49). We observe a decreasing trend of the period from onset to isolation and R values of both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Interpretation The 2019-nCoV may have a higher pandemic risk than SARS broken out in 2003. The implemented public-health efforts have significantly decreased the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV. However, more rigorous control and prevention strategies and measures to contain its further spread.

However, a retrospective surveillance study identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far surpasses the 425 confirmed cases reported across all age groups, none of which were children under age 15. Children are strikingly absent from COVID-19 reports and limited data suggest that pediatric infections are overwhelmingly mild5. Thus, our estimates for hundreds of severe pediatric cases likely translates to thousands or even tens of thousands of mildly infected children, suggesting that the force of infection from children may be grossly underestimated and the infection fatality rate overestimated from confirmed case counts alone. This highlights the urgent need for more robust surveillance to gauge the true extent and severity of COVID-19 in all ages.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Zhanwei; Nugent, Ciara; Cowling, Benjamin J; Meyers, Lauren Ancel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3544dc05d167913e81239c9bb7d06e8b1e6e47d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037176","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["pediatric case of COVID","cumulative pediatric COVID","severity of COVID","infected children","pediatric admissions","pediatric infections","hundreds of severe pediatric cases","confirmed cases","robust surveillance","CI","central Wuhan hospitals","detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data","retrospective surveillance study","limited data","tens of thousands","epidemic dynamics","force of infection","age groups","epidemic doubling time","infection fatality rate","true extent","reports","hospitalizations","estimates","days4","ratio","urgent need","day period","Appendix","mild5","mainland China","lockdown","ages","Figure"],"language":"en"},

The exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments (ED). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is based on an RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material. However, RT-PCR testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual\u2032s risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the ED. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with respiratory symptoms were gathered. Using these parameters, an easy-to-use point-based algorithm, called the corona-score, was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and those testing negative. Computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score. Validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients. Results: The corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population. Patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 versus 11 (scale 0-14) in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p\u003C0.001).

Conclusion: The corona-score effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR outcome based on routine parameters.

Abstract Influenza is a very common contagious disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment with antiviral drugs is available, which if administered early, can reduce the risk of severe complications. However, many virus types develop resistance to those drugs, leading to a notable loss of efficacy. There has been great interest in the development of new drugs to combat this disease. A wide range of drugs has shown anti-influenza activity, but they are not yet available for use in the clinic. Many of these target viral components, which others are aimed at elements in the host cell which participate in the viral cycle. Modulating host components is a strategy which minimizes the development of resistance, since host components are not subject to the genetic variability of the virus. The main disadvantage is the risk of treatment-related side effects. The aim of this review is to describe the main pharmacological agents currently available and new drugs in the pipeline with potential benefit in the treatment of influenza.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amarelle, Luciano; Lecuona, Emilia; Sznajder, Jacob I.","journal":"Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e261c16f731485ca6c09dec03daa029787a69d4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289616302058; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289616302058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The aim of","the genetic variability of the virus","the risk of treatment","in the clinic","the development of resistance","in the viral cycle","The main disadvantage","the risk of severe complications","been great interest in the development of new drugs","the main pharmacological agents currently available and new drugs in the pipeline with potential benefit in the treatment of influenza","wide range of drugs","aimed at elements in the host cell which","many virus","Many of these target viral components","notable loss of efficacy","those drugs","tipos de virus","Treatment with antiviral drugs","which others","strategy which","nuevos f\u00E1rmacos","f\u00E1rmacos antivirales","since host components","Modulating host components","gran variedad de f\u00E1rmacos","influenza activity","Abstract Influenza","ciclo viral","tratamiento disponible","gripe","objetivo componentes","not yet available for","which if administered early","not subject","develop resistance","enfermedad contagiosa","c\u00E9lula hu\u00E9sped","gran inter\u00E9s","riesgo de complicaciones severas","desarrollo de cepas resistentes","significant morbidity and mortality","principales agentes farmacol\u00F3gicos disponibles","mayor riesgo de efectos secundarios asociados","but they","shown anti","leading","that","very common contagious","actualidad","review","related side effects","potencial beneficio","nuevas opciones terap\u00E9uticas","embargo","estudio","There","combat","presente revisi\u00F3n","estrategia","However","principal desventaja","significativa morbimortalidad","elementos","variabilidad gen\u00E9tica","actividad antiinfluenza","resistencia","forma precoz","lado","cl\u00EDnica","uso","efectividad"],"language":"es"},

(2019) used their EpiRank algorithm, which emphasizes forward-and-backward commuter flow between homes and workplaces, to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in Taiwan: the 2009-H1N1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus (EV). As this article was being prepared, the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID-19 had yet to be identified, but according to the American Centers for Disease Control, its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). To consider potential COVID-19 spatial patterns, we applied EpiRank to the 2003 SARS outbreak in north Taiwan for comparison with H1N1 and EV. SARS was found to be less contagious than H1N1 or EV, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. The characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns, as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement. Our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate EpiRank spatial patterns for the 2003 SARS outbreak for comparison with EpiRank-determined distributions for the H1N1 and EV outbreaks. Our results indicate that the daytime parameter (i.e., forward movement effect) range was slightly higher (0.5-0.55) for the SARS outbreak than for either the influenza (0.4-0.5) or EV (0.3-0.5) outbreaks, suggesting that the forward-and-backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of SARS. While COVID-19 might resemble either SARS or H1N1 in terms of spatial spreading, its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in-between, with backward movement being dominant (similar to H1N1) or with forward and backward movement being equally important (similar to SARS). Building on Huang et al.

We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD out-competes the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 35% in terms of the calculated binding affinity. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowdhury, Ratul; Maranas, Costas D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rosetta"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strong binding","strongest binding","binding interactions","spike protein SARS-CoV","human ACE2","Rosetta binding energy","ACE2 residues","native binding partner of ACE2","spike protein of SARS","ATR1 binding site","bat ACE2","calculated binding affinity","increased infectivity of SARS","coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain","ACE2 of different livestock","RBD","human cells","bat coronavirus RaTG13","receptor type","angiotensin","hACE2","stable complex","cell surface receptor","Rosetta energy function","greatest number of residues","strong electrostatic attachments","residues solvent accessible","pet species","reservoir species","enhanced infectivity","N-terminus alpha-helix","entry","bats","viral origin","enzyme","feline","virulent pathogen","computational explanation","Ser19","hypothesis","equine","turn","novel","rank","terms","Asn53","epidemic","therapeutic modalities","chicken","results"],"language":"en"},

Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively. Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xing; Ma, Zihui; Ning, Yi; Chen, Chen; Chen, Rujin; Chen, Qiwen; Zhang, Heng; Li, Chunming; He, Yan; Wang, Tao; Tong, Cheng; Wu, Junqing; Li, Yuyan; Ma, Handong; Zhang, Shaodian; Zhao, Hongxin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P.

We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA-C*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by \u003E40% of the population.

It is hoped that the \u0022City Closure\u0022 decree issued by the Italian government will go in the right direction, because this is the only way to curb the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Guorong; Li, Xinru; Shen, Yang; Fan, Jiao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93137037ac3f5cbc25549ce22a87fa47bd7e25fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Italy","epidemic data","Italian COVID","inflection point","Italian government","Coronavirus disease","diagnosed patients","global threat infectious disease","Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average","simple time series analysis model","various mathematical models","ARIMA","protection","good job of personal hygiene","decree","regional isolation","team leaders","medical forces","reliable points","City Closure","right direction","multiple studies","evolution","spread","conclusion","cumulative number","way"],"language":"en"},

Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about four weeks does not have an appreciable effect, issuing mandates after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. In other words, there is a nontrivial but tight \u0022window of opportunity\u0022 for commencing social distancing. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule\u0027s frequency.

Recent studies suggest that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could be effective against COVID-19. It is reasonable to expect that if HCQ can prevent or reduce the adverse effects of influenza, it may also reduce the effects of COVID-19 in humans. The objective of this study was to test whether HCQ can prevent or reduce the risk and severity of influenza. Methods. This is an observational cohort study using medico-administrative data from Quebec. Patients included had at least one emergency department (ED) visit in 2012 or 2013, with a prior diagnosis of chronic conditions, and were admissible to the public drug insurance plan. Two sub-cohorts were considered depending on reasons for ED visit: other than influenza or pneumonia (primary prevention) and influenza or pneumonia (secondary prevention). Results. In the primary prevention analysis (n=417,353), patients taking HCQ (n=3,659) had an increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia in the following year compared to those who did not (5.2% vs. 2.9%; adjusted OR=1.25, p=0.0079). In the secondary prevention analysis (n=27,152), patients taking HCQ (n=392), compared to those who did not had a modest and non-significant increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia after 30 days (25.8% vs. 22.6%; adjusted OR=1.14, p=0.3177). Interpretation: Based on the assumption that HCQ has similar effects on the COVID-19 as those observed on influenza, we can infer that it will not have positive effects on COVID-19. We should therefore act cautiously before initiating prospective interventional studies on the use of HCQ to reduce adverse effects of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vanasse, Alain; Courteau, Josiane; Chiu, Yohann; Cantin, Andre; Leduc, Richard","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057893","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["HCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia","use of HCQ","adverse effects of influenza","adverse effects of COVID","similar effects","severity of influenza","positive effects","Patients","primary prevention analysis","secondary prevention analysis","ED visit","non-significant increased risk of hospitalization","Recent studies","observational cohort study","prospective interventional studies","medico-administrative data","public drug insurance plan","reasons","hydroxychloroquine","assumption","prior diagnosis of chronic conditions","Quebec","emergency department","following year","sub-cohorts","days","humans","Interpretation","objective","Background","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Defining the optimal approach for managing a critically ill COVID-19 patient is rapidly changing. Goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used by physicians caring for intubated critically-ill patients as a reliable imaging modality that is well-suited to answer questions at bedside. A multi-disciplinary group of experts in point-of-care echocardiography and TEE representing intensive care, critical care cardiology and emergency medicine from the United States and Canada, convened to review the available evidence, share experiences, and produce a consensus statement aimed to provide clinicians with a framework to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers when considering TEE in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can provide the information needed in most patients, there are specific scenarios in which TEE represents the modality of choice. Among other critical care applications, TEE can allow hemodynamic assessment of patients during prone ventilation, perform serial evaluations of the lungs during recruitment maneuvers, guide cardiac arrest resuscitation, and facilitate veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) cannulation. To aid other clinicians in performing TEE during the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe a set of principles and practical aspects for performing examinations with a focus on the logistics, personnel, equipment required before, during, and after an examination. In the right clinical scenario, TEE is a tool that can provide the information needed to deliver the best and safest possible care for the critically ill patient.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teran, Felipe; Burns, Katharine M.; Narasimhan, Mangala; Goffi, Alberto; Mohabir, Paul; Horowitz, James M.; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Nagdev, Arun; Panebianco, Nova; Chin, Eric J.; Gottlieb, Michael; Koenig, Seth; Arntfield, Robert","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/375475ef77c0cc73faab6357885fb6c720c26341.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0894731720303291; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894731720303291?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America","United States","Canada"],"keyphrases":["TEE","ill patients","care echocardiography","ill COVID","intensive care","safety of patients","pandemic","critical care cardiology","critical care applications","safest possible care","hemodynamic assessment of patients","transesophageal echocardiography","transthoracic echocardiography","clinicians","information","healthcare systems","healthcare providers","modality of choice","reliable imaging modality","veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation","emergency medicine","recruitment maneuvers","VV-ECMO","serial evaluations","prone ventilation","point","cardiac arrest resuscitation","extraordinary strain","examinations","lungs","practical aspects","United States","North America","multi-disciplinary group of experts","experiences","logistics","focus","Canada","set of principles","tool","right clinical scenario","specific scenarios","personnel","cannulation","consensus statement","questions","TTE","framework","Goal","available evidence","optimal approach","equipment","bedside","physicians"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus.

This results in a virus spreading dynamics model. The results should be verified, but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state. Recommendations for improvement are welcome. We come to the following conclusions: 1. Complete lockdown works. About 10 days after lockdown, the infection dynamics dies down. This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality. Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown. 2. As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier. This is based on the following insights: a. Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continues at home, leading to another tripling of the cases before the dynamics is slowed. b. There will be many critical cases coming from people who were infected before lockdown. Because of the exponential growth dynamics, their number will be large. c. Researchers with more detailed disease progression models should improve upon these statements. 3. Our simulations say that complete removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces and during leisure activities will not be enough to sufficiently slow down the infection dynamics. It would have been better, but still not sufficient, if initiated earlier. 4. Infections in public transport play an important role. In the simulations shown later, removing infections in the public transport system reduces the infection speed and the height of the peak by approximately 20%. Evidently, this depends on the infection parameters, which are not well known. -- This does not point to reducing public transport capacities as a reaction to the reduced demand, but rather use it for lower densities of passengers and thus reduced infection rates. 5. In our simulations, removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces, leisure activities, and in public transport may barely have been sufficient to control the infection dynamics if implemented early on. Now according to our simulations it is too late for this, and (even) harsher measures will have to be initiated until possibly a return to such a restrictive, but still somewhat functional regime will again be possible. Evidently, all of these results have to be taken with care. They are based on preliminary infection parameters taken from the literature, used inside a model that has more transport/movement details than all others that we are aware of but still not enough to describe all aspects of reality, and suffer from having to write computer code under time pressure. Optimally, they should be confirmed independently. Short of that, given current knowledge we believe that they provide justification for \u0022complete lockdown\u0022 at the latest when about 10% of available hospital capacities for COVID-19 are in use (and possibly earlier; we are no experts of hospital capabilities). What was not investigated in detail in our simulations was contact tracing, i.e. tracking down the infection chains and moving all people along infection chains into quarantine. The case of Singapore has so far shown that this may be successful. Preliminary simulation of that tactic shows that it is difficult to implement for COVID-19, since the incubation time is rather long, people are contagious before they feel sick, or maybe never feel sufficiently sick at all. We will investigate in future work if and how contact tracing can be used together with a restrictive, but not totally locked down regime. When opening up after lockdown, it would be important to know the true fraction of people who are already immune, since that would slow down the infection dynamics by itself. For Wuhan, the currently available numbers report that only about 0.1% of the population was infected, which would be very far away from \u0022herd immunity\u0022. However, there have been and still may be many unknown infections.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Sebastian Alexander; Balmer, Michael; Neumann, Andreas; Nagel, Kai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67d4b60b7c432e0dd352eceea7acc86185e9aac7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection dynamics","Complete lockdown","infection chains","infection speed","preliminary infection parameters","dynamics model","simulations","reduced infection rates","public transport capacities","complete removal of infections","use","public transport system","exponential growth dynamics","people","COVID","results","hospital capacities available","available hospital capacities","current time pressure","child care","experts of hospital capabilities","primary schools","workplaces","leisure activities","incubation time","literature","current knowledge","contact tracing","Preliminary simulation","current state","reduced demand","functional regime","critical cases","following insights","following conclusions","aspects of reality","human mobility models","detailed disease progression models","reaction","Researchers","number","lower densities of passengers","important role","argument","tactic","future work","computer code","height","tripling","justification","quarantine","home","days","movement details","Recommendations","improvement","strong support","peak","recent publications","statements","rule of thumb","harsher measures","case of Singapore","return","true fraction of people","Wuhan","available numbers","herd immunity","unknown infections","infection dynamics","population","lockdown"],"language":"en"},

Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission. Methods: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed Covid-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals). Conclusions: Work-related transmission is considerable in early Covid-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW. Implementing preventive/surveillance strategies for high-risk working populations is warranted.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lan, F.-Y.; Wei, C.-F.; Hsu, Y.-T.; Christiani, D.

However, no epidemiological study has examined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of healthcare workers during the early phase of community transmission. Objective: To determine the baseline prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of previously undiagnosed healthcare workers and a comparison group of non-healthcare workers. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: A large U.S. university and two affiliated university hospitals Participants: 546 health care workers and 283 non-health care workers with no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection Exposure: Healthcare worker status and role Main outcome(s) and measure(s): SARS-CoV-2 infection status as determined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs. Results: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among healthcare workers (7.3%) than in non-healthcare workers (0.4%), representing a 7.0% greater absolute risk (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7%, 9.3%). The majority of infected healthcare workers (62.5%) worked as nurses. Positive tests increased across the two weeks of cohort recruitment in line with rising confirmed cases in the hospitals and surrounding counties. Conclusions and relevance: In a prospective cohort conducted in the early phases of community transmission, healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than non-healthcare workers, attesting to the occupational hazards of caring for patients in this crisis. Baseline data reported here will enable us to monitor the spread of infection and examine risk factors for transmission among healthcare workers. These results will inform optimal strategies for protecting the healthcare workforce, their families, and their patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrett, Emily S; Horton, Daniel B.; Roy, Jason; Gennaro, Maria Laura; Brooks, Andrew; Tischfield, Jay; Greenberg, Patricia; Andrews, Tracy; Jagpal, Sugeet; Reilly, Nancy; Blaser, Martin J.; Carson, Jeffrey; Panettieri, Reynold A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/398f911d31dd4a225ac0fc5dab93c09475ccb35d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072470v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["cohort of healthcare workers","undiagnosed healthcare workers","majority of infected healthcare workers","healthcare workforce","comparison group of non-healthcare workers","infection status","infection Exposure","baseline prevalence of SARS","non-health care workers","Healthcare worker status","known prior SARS-CoV","presence of SARS","spread of infection","higher prevalence of SARS","risk factors","Prospective cohort study Setting","risk difference","infected patients","weeks of cohort recruitment","early phases of community transmission","early phase of community transmission","occupational exposure","greater absolute risk","Baseline data","Results","affiliated university hospitals Participants","increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","epidemiological study","occupational hazards","Positive tests","role Main outcome","rising confirmed cases","confidence interval","measure","optimal strategies","Design","RNA","surrounding counties","oropharyngeal swabs","relevance","families","Conclusions","Objective","Importance","crisis","symptoms","nurses"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, MPI\u2019s risk analysis combines several estimates that are biased, and the biases consistently act together to underestimate the level of bycatch and overestimate the species\u2019 ability to sustain impacts. In essence, the approach uses abundance estimates that are likely biased high, multiplies them by a reproductive rate that has been arbitrarily raised, multiplied by an assumed figure for calf survival, to reach a number of dolphins that would be added each year if the population were to remain stable. From this number, they subtract their estimates of bycatch, which are almost certainly biased low. The remaining number of dolphins is apportioned a cause of death according to autopsy data from 55 Hector\u2019s and Maui dolphins found dead on beaches. This is then compared to estimates of what level of takes would be sustainable, calculated using a formula that is not well understood and less conservative than the international standard (PBR, developed by the US National Marine Fisheries Service). This is a poor basis for rational management of an endangered, endemic marine mammal. A key problem with the MPI approach is that its definition of \u201Crisk\u201D does not relate to the risk of population decline or extinction, and is inconsistent with the modern understanding of the behaviour of meta-populations. The approach defines risk as the likelihood of capture, which is apportioned to different areas according to fishing effort and the habitat model\u2019s outputs for dolphin distribution. The protection options are therefore targeted where high densities of dolphins and high fishing effort coincide. Large populations are allocated the highest level of protection, while small populations remain poorly protected. This approach is likely to increase the risk of local extinctions, contractions of dolphin distribution, population fragmentation, loss of genetic variability and result in increased risk to the species as a whole. Many of these points were made by an International Expert Panel in 2018. MPI have failed to provide a list of recommendations from the Expert Panel Report with their responses (if any) to those recommendations. This standard step in scientific practice, following peer review (e.g. response to reviewers\u2019 comments) has not been followed.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slooten, Elisabeth; Dawson, Stephen Michael","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc438049780f4248683550e77739161a7fa2035b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098889","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hector"],"organizations":["New Zealand\u2019s Ministry for Primary Industries","MPI","US National Marine Fisheries Service","International Expert Panel"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of population","increased risk","Maui dolphins","MPI approach","MPI\u2019s risk analysis","high densities of dolphins","risk of local extinctions","remaining number of dolphins","estimates of bycatch","protection options","abundance estimates","level of bycatch","high fishing effort","highest level of protection","Hector\u2019s","population fragmentation","small populations","International Expert Panel","Large populations","international standard","contractions of dolphin distribution","Expert Panel Report","behaviour of meta-populations","standard step","Ministers of Fisheries","list of recommendations","US National Marine Fisheries Service","endemic marine mammal","loss of genetic variability","peer review","result","habitat model\u2019s outputs","rational management","Primary Industries","autopsy data","scientific practice","PBR","order","New Zealand\u2019s Ministry","modern understanding","cause of death","calf survival","reviewers\u2019 comments","poor basis","species\u2019 ability","different areas","assumed figure","responses","beaches","likelihood of capture","key problem","essence","definition","impacts","Conservation","points","year","reproductive rate","formula","biases"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome. Methods Here, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene. Results We identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Conclusion Our study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fadason, Tayaza; Gokuladhas, Sreemol; Golovina, Evgeniia; Ho, Daniel; Farrow, Sophie; Nyaga, Denis; Pan, Hong; Karnani, Neerja; Wong, Conroy; Cooper, Antony; Schierding, William; O\u2019Sullivan, Justin M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3fdec7303d8bd1cb93fa825d8df9fbdee7f04ea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.042002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulation of ACE2 gene expression","SARS-CoV virus","virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression","activity of gene regulatory regions","regulatory interactions","gene products","activity of regulatory elements","viral silencing of ACE2","expression of PIR","tissue-specific gene expression data","severe acute respiratory failure","severe cases","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","triggers severe pneumonia","spatial expression quantitative trait loci","physical chromatin interactions","significant role","significant contribution","viral replication","lung type","genome organization","Chromatin remodeling","human cells","alveolar epithelial cells","eQTLs","intra-cellular environment suitable","death","blood flow","polyamine synthesis","pressure","novo pyrimidine","hypothesis","Introduction","inflammatory responses","targeted experiments","genes","CA5B","identification","entry","RAS system","fluid homeostasis","COVID","endoplasmic reticulum","VPS13C","fact","main receptor","pathogen responsible","study","outbreak","Angiotensin","enzyme","Conclusion","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an \u201Ceasy-to-use\u201D mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period \u03C4 = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions.

Methods: A total of 21 mild patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this pilot RCT from February 2020 through March 2020, and then were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, into control (11 patients) and 99mTc-MDP group (10 patients). Patients in the control group received routine treatment and patients assigned to the 99mTc-MDP group received a combination of routine treatment and an administration of 99mTc-MDP injection of 5ml/day. Both of the patients in the control and 99mTc-MDP groups were treated for 7 days with the primary end point of CT-based radiological pulmonary changes during 7-day follow-up. Findings: From baseline to the day 7, 8 (80%) of 10 mild patients in the 99mTc-MDP group had a significant radiological improvement in lung and a decline in inflammatory infiltration, whereas only 1 (9.1%) of 11 patients in the control group had a radiological improvement in lung. None of the patients in the 99mTc-MDP group had disease progression from mild to severe, as well as an inflammatory cytokine storm, and 2 mild patients (18.2%) in the control group developed severe. During days 7 through 14, the number of patients with radiological improvement in the 99mTc-MDP group remained consistent, and only 1 additional case (22%) in the control group were reported. Conclusion: In this randomized pilot study, 99mTc-MDP had an effective inhibitory effect on the inflammatory disease progression for the therapy of COVID-19, and it can accelerate the absorption of pulmonary inflammation in a short period of time during the process of treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Xiaolin; Yi, Wanrong; Liu, Baoyi; Tian, Simiao; Cao, Fang; Wang, Ruoyu; Qi, Baiwen; Lu, Faqiang; Fang, Meiyun; Pei, Fuyang; Chen, Ming; Zhang, Lichuan; Zhang, Yong; Zhang, Xiuzhi; Pan, Zhenyu; Zhao, Dewei; Yu, Aixi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/825207cd9dc06484fd84231e0c45fa172b161e3e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20054767","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control group","mild patients","mTc-MDP injection","mTc-MDP groups","number of patients","effective COVID","therapy of COVID","therapeutic treatment","significant radiological improvement","process of treatment","inflammatory disease progression","radiological pulmonary changes","increasing cases of COVID","combination of routine treatment","randomized pilot study","lung","inflammatory infiltration","days","day follow-up","pilot RCT","inflammatory cytokine storm","controlled study","effective inhibitory effect","absorption of pulmonary inflammation","specific therapeutic drugs","world","administration","short period of time","primary end point of CT","decline","urgent need","efficacy","total","Background","Conclusion","additional case","Findings","baseline","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, here we consider the time evolution of the ratio of the diagnosed positive cases to number of swabs, which is more representative of the evolution of the pandemic when the number of swabs is increasing or changing in time.

The use of different distributions provides an independent estimate of the uncertainty. We then consider five possible cases for the number of daily swabs and we then estimate the potential dates of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed positive cases. We then perform Monte Carlo simulations with 25000 runs to evaluate the uncertainty in the prediction of the date of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed daily cases.

Methods: Available data from PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, WanFang Database and VIP Database, were analyzed using a fixed effects model meta-analysis to derive overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and Begg\u0027s were used to assess publication bias. Findings: Of 182 articles found following our initial search, we assessed 34 full-text articles, of which 9 articles with 1936 COVID-19 patients met all selection criteria for our meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity between studies. There were significant correlations between COVID-19 severity and hypertension [OR=2.3 [95% CI (1.76, 3.00), P\u003C0.01], diabetes [OR=2.67, 95% CI (1.91, 3.74), P\u003C0.01], coronary heart disease [OR=2.85 [95% CI (1.68, 4.84), P\u003C0.01].

While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. Preliminary findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. In particular, large decreases in the amount of social activity through family (58%), friends/neighbors (44.9%) or entertainment (46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower satisfaction (-30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, social contact score through digital technologies has significantly increased (p\u003C0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology. Conclusion These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period. Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through technology-based solution is urgently needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"AMMAR, A.; Chtourou, H.; Boukhris, O.; Trabelsi, K.; Masmoudi, L.; Brach, M.; Bouaziz, B.; Bentlage, E.; How, D.; Ahmed, M.; Mueller, P.; Mueller, N.; Aloui, A.; Hammouda, O.; Paineiras-Domingos, L.

Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3\u002B lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm3, CD4\u002B lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm3, and CD8\u002B lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm3.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Qiang; Li, Yong-zhe; Huang, Gang; Wu, Wei; Dong, Sheng-yong; Xu, Yang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/901572f1595cb6ea733858d3fc15b8ea46054061.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20031229","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","cells","mm3","Wuhan","IQR","reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population","normal controls","levels of lymphocytes","clinical characteristics of SARS","infected pneumonia","ill patients","Shanghai","Beijing","reference ranges of people","spectrum of cases","mortality rate","number of cases","data","high risk of COVID","infection","CD3","information","CD4","CD8","cellular immune function","hospitals","China","novel coronavirus","admission","case series","findings","objective","Fever","common symptom","fatigue","sputum","headache"],"language":"en"},

This paper compares several suppression approaches and potential exit strategies using a new extended epidemic SEIR model. It concludes that while rapid and strong lock-down is an effective pandemic suppression measure, a combination of other strategies such as social distancing, active protection and removal can achieve similar suppression synergistically.

It is likely different countries and populations respond differently to the same NPIs and that these differences are reflected in the epidemic development. Methods We build a Bayesian model that estimates the number of deaths on a given day dependent on changes in the basic reproductive number, R0, due to changes in mobility patterns. We utilize mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model. Findings The changes in mobility have a large overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for 97 % of the reduction in R0 (95% confidence interval [0\u22C579,0\u22C599]). Interpretation Our model predicts three-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium.

Recently, a severe respiratory illness outbreak of HCoV-NL63 has been reported in a long-term care facility. Sambucus FormosanaNakai, a species of elderberry, is a traditional medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory and antiviral potential. The study investigated the antiviral activity of Sambucus FormosanaNakai stem ethanol extract and some phenolic acid constituents against HCoV-NL63. The extract was less cytotoxic and concentration-dependently increased anti-HCoV-NL63 activities, including cytopathicity, sub-G1 fraction, virus yield (IC50 = 1.17 \u03BCg/ml), plaque formation (IC50 = 4.67 \u03BCg/ml) and virus attachment (IC50 = 15.75 \u03BCg/ml). Among the phenolic acid constituents in Sambucus FormosanaNakai extract, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and gallic acid sustained the anti-HCoV-NL63 activity that was ranked in the following order of virus yield reduction: caffeic acid (IC50 = 3.54 \u03BCM) \u003E chlorogenic acid (IC50 = 43.45 \u03BCM) \u003E coumaric acid (IC50 = 71.48 \u03BCM). Caffeic acid significantly inhibited the replication of HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner, and specifically blocked virus attachment (IC50 = 8.1 \u03BCM). Therefore, the results revealed that Sambucus Formosana Nakai stem ethanol extract displayed the strong anti-HCoV-NL63 potential; caffeic acid could be the vital component with anti-HCoV-NL63 activity.

Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population. We focus on model solutions which take into consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R0), probability of death in the vulnerable fraction of the population, infectious period and time from infection to death, with the intention of exploring the sensitivity of the system to the actual fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease and death. Our simulations are in agreement with other studies that the current epidemic wave in the UK and Italy in the absence of interventions should have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, with numbers of deaths lagging behind in time relative to overall infections. Importantly, the results we present here suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion currently immune and the fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease. This relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lourenco, Jose; Paton, Robert; Ghafari, Mahan; Kraemer, Moritz; Thompson, Craig; Simmonds, Peter; Klenerman, Paul; Gupta, Sunetra","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26731bb4d339d3c8b5d1175234db6c4c75dd6dad.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["vulnerable fraction","population vulnerable","reported death","Italy","UK","probability of death","current levels of herd immunity","ongoing epidemic of SARS","cases of infection","reliable read-outs of protective immunity","actual fraction","real-time data","cumulative reported SARS-CoV","severe disease","accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity","current epidemic wave","confirmed cases of SARS","valuable data sources","associated deaths","numbers of deaths","rapid implementation","reported events","assumption","initial phase of slow accumulation of new infections","effects of social distancing","phase of rapid growth","implementation of control measures","epidemiological theory","infectious period","neutralization assays","robust assays","time relative","model solutions","proper assessment","ongoing epidemics","overall infections","urgent need","Urgent development","susceptible-infected","inverse relationship","consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters","depletion of susceptible individuals","novel pathogenic infectious agent","paired samples of acute","blood banks","convalescent sera","basic reproduction number","provision of open access","virus","technologies","viral pseudotype","R0","studies","SIR","tests","United Kingdom","investment","spread","months","absence of interventions","transmission","proportion","scale","future policy direction","case incidence","approximate duration","sensitivity","agreement","system","travel","intention","countries","coming weeks","simulations","distinct phases","termination","people","hospitalisation","results","pattern"],"language":"en"},

Embecovirus particles are studded with two types of surface projections called S (for spike) and HE (for haemagglutinin-esterase), with S mediating receptor-binding and membrane fusion and HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Together, they promote dynamic virion attachment to glycan-based receptors with 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as main constituent. We recently showed that adaptation of HKU1 and OC43 to replication in the human respiratory tract involved loss-of-function mutations in the lectin domain of HE. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the \u223C80 kDa, heavily glycosylated HKU1 HE at a global resolution of 3.4 \u00C5. Comparison to existing HE structures reveals a drastically truncated lectin domain, incompatible with sialic acid binding, but with the structure and function of the HE esterase domain left intact. Our cryo-EM structure, in combination with mass spectrometry analysis, also describes the extent of glycosylation on the now redundant lectin domain, which forms a putative glycan shield. The findings further our insight into the evolution and host adaptation of human embecoviruses and also demonstrate the utility of cryo-EM for studying small, heavily glycosylated proteins which are intractable to X-ray crystallography.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hurdiss, Daniel L.; Drulyte, Ieva; Lang, Yifei; Shamorkina, Tatiana M.; Pronker, Matti F.; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; Snijder, Joost; de Groot, Raoul J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66f675bdd0d9c4a0a782abd0fbdd9116461ee053.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.998963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OC43","esterase domain","glycosylated HKU1","adaptation of HKU1","cryo-EM structure","human betacoronaviruses HKU1","redundant lectin domain","truncated lectin domain","sialic acid binding","utility of cryo","S mediating receptor-binding","host adaptation of human embecoviruses","human respiratory tract","O-acetylated sialic acid","subgenus Embecovirus","glycosylated proteins","function mutations","Embecovirus particles","haemagglutinin-esterase","glycan-based receptors","putative glycan shield","evolution","combination","replication","loss","membrane fusion","separate zoonotic introductions","dynamic virion attachment","mass spectrometry analysis","main constituent","types of surface projections","spike","insight","extent of glycosylation","global resolution","kDa","crystallography","Comparison","findings","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P\u003C0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: \u003C 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

The most effective experimental therapy against the EBOV is the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this work, we describe the development of HEK293T cells engineered for the transient and stable expression of mAb13C6, a neutralizing anti-EBOV monoclonal antibody. We transfected the HEK293T cells with a tricistronic vector to produce the heavy and the light chain of the antibody 13C6 and intracellular Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) using Lipofectamine 3000. We then selected the transfected cells using puromycin pressure, dilution cloning, and cloning disks. This integrated strategy generated mAb-producing cells in 7 days with a transient expression of \u223C1 mg/L. Stable pools were produced after 4 weeks, with expression levels of \u223C0.8 mg/L. Stable clones with expression levels of \u223C1.8 mg/L were obtained within 10 weeks. The produced antibodies exhibited the expected functionality; they recognized the GP glycoprotein of the Ebola virus in both ELISA assays and cell binding experiments using HEK293T cells engineered to express the EBOV GP at their membrane surface. By the combined use of GFP and the set of selection techniques here described, we drastically reduced the time from transfection to stable clone generation without resorting to costly equipment.

Methods To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy. Results In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue. Conclusions Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques.

Multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that the past medical history of coronary heart disease[OR:2.806 95%CI:0.971~16.795], decreased lymphocytes[OR:0.040, 95%CI:0.001~2.306], increased AST[OR:1.026, 95%CI:1.000~1.052], increased SSA[OR:1.021, 95%CI:1.001~1.025], and increased D-dimer[OR:1.231, 95%CI:1.042~1.456] are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients pneumonia with comorbidities. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with coronary heart disease is relatively high. In all patients, the lower lymphocytes, and higher NLR, BUN, PCT, CRP, SSA, D-dimer are significant characteristics. The past medical history of coronary heart disease, decreased lymphocytes, increased AST, SSA and D-dimer are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, C.; Yi, Z.

Materials and Method: A consecutive cohort of 73 COVID-19 and 48 influenza pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five independent institutions. The courses of both diseases were confirmed to be in the early stages (mean 2.66 (SD 2.62) days for COVID-19 and mean 2.19 (SD 2.10) days for influenza pneumonia after onset). The chi-square test, student\u0060s t-test, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test were performed to compare CT imaging and clinical features between the two groups. Spearman or Kendall correlation tests between feature metrics and diagnosis outcomes were also assessed. The diagnostic performance of each feature in differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia was evaluated with univariate analysis. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and threshold were reported. Results: The ground-glass opacification (GGO) was the most common imaging feature in COVID-19, including pure-GGO (75.3%) and mixed-GGO (78.1%), mainly in peripheral distribution. For clinical features, most COVID-19 patients presented normal white blood cell (WBC) count (89.04%) and neutrophil count (84.93%). Twenty imaging features and 6 clinical features were identified to be significantly different between the two diseases. The diagnosis outcomes correlated significantly with the WBC count (r=-0.526, P\u003C0.001) and neutrophil count (r=-0.500, P\u003C0.001). Four CT imaging features had absolute correlations coefficients higher than 0.300 (P\u003C0.001), including crazy-paving pattern, mixed-GGO in peripheral area, pleural effusions, and consolidation. Conclusions: Among a total of 1537 lesions and 62 imaging and clinical features, 26 features were demonstrated to be significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. The crazy-paving pattern was recognized as the most powerful imaging feature for the differential diagnosis in the early stage, while WBC count yielded the highest diagnostic efficacy in clinical manifestations.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Z.; Lin, D.; Chen, X.; Qiu, J.; Li, S.; Huang, R.; Sun, H.; Liao, Y.; Xiao, J.; Tang, Y.; Liu, G.; Wu, R.; Dai, Z.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fbb5878c88923eace735df58b23329cc816d497.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20061242v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["WBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical features","CT imaging features","valuable features","powerful imaging feature","common imaging feature","differentiating COVID","WBC count","influenza pneumonia patients","clinical manifestations","neutrophil count","differential diagnosis","mixed-GGO","diagnosis outcomes","feature metrics","pure-GGO","chi-square test","peripheral area","SD","crazy-paving pattern","early stages","days","diseases","s t-test","Kruskal-Wallis H-test","diagnostic performance","corresponding area","peripheral distribution","highest diagnostic efficacy","absolute correlations coefficients higher","normal white blood cell","Kendall correlation tests","accuracy","AUC","student","pleural effusions","differences","specificity","curve","ground-glass opacification","Spearman","consecutive cohort","lesions","sensitivity","threshold","Materials","Method","Results","consolidation","total","univariate analysis","onset","Purpose","groups","independent institutions","Conclusions","courses"],"language":"en"},

An immunoinformatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B Cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which found to be 100% conserved with other SARS coronaviruses. Furthermore, the population coverage analysis has found that CD4\u002B T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over to CD8\u002B peptides in the 16 different geographical regions in the world. Notably, only 09 out of 15 peptides (LTDEMIAQY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQ, VITPGTNTS, WTAGAAAYY and QTQTNSPRRARS) that have 80% - 90% identity with experimentally identified epitopes of different organisms including SARS-CoV and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design. Moreover, docking analysis suggested that these peptides are tightly bound in the groove of HLA molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall this study allows us to determine potent peptide antigen targets in surface glycoprotein on intuitive grounds which open up a new horizon in COVID-19 research.

The role and significance of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet well known. Methods. We therefore conducted a study on 46 symptomatic subjects with disease ascertained by laboratory tests to evaluate the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies in these subjects in relation to the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. The analytical performance of the method used in the study (Maglumi 800, SNIBE, China) and the effect of two different serum and plasma matrices were also assessed. Results. IgG positivity was demonstrated in 100% of cases 15 days after the onset of the disease. IgM show lower concentrations and do not exceed 77% of cases after 15 days. The analytical performance of the method used was confirmed to be good in terms of imprecision, linearity, commutability in two blood sample matrices. Conclusion. The serological study through the search for specific IgG for SARS-CoV-2 results in our case series is sensitive and suitable for population research and can also play a role in diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of specific IgMs are lower.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dittadi, R.; Afshar, H.; Carraro, P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c97638b3c9f278ebd0a91e98cb7230aa0eb711c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.19.20099317v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["specific IgG","analytical performance","SARS-CoV","presence of IgG","disease","serological study","IgG positivity","role","Results","days","cases","diagnostic performance of specific IgMs","symptomatic subjects","IgM antibodies","plasma matrices","lower concentrations","onset of symptoms","blood sample matrices","linearity","commutability","effect","case series","laboratory tests","immune response","terms of imprecision","population research","different serum","SNIBE","time","significance","relation","Maglumi","China","infection","diagnosis","Background","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG can be helpful in identification of asymptomatic infections. We report baseline results of the CVOID-19 Contact (CoCo) Study, which follows 217 frontline healthcare workers at a university hospital and performs weekly SARS-CoV-2 specific serology (IgA/IgG). The majority of participants had direct contact to patients with infectious respiratory diseases. Study participants estimated their personal likelihood of having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection with a mean of 20.9% (range 0 to 90%). In contrast, anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was in the range of 1-2% among health care workers. The CoCo Study is not fully representative for other hospitals and the sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology in low prevalence conditions may require further improvement. Taken together, low rates of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in healthcare workers in Northern Germany are in sharp contrast to the high personal risk perception. Regular anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing of health-care workers may aid in monitoring the pandemic, assessing the quality of immune responses, directing resources for protective measures, and assuring CVID-19 care in the long run.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Behrens, G.

Many clinical trials have been initiated with existing medications, but assessments of the expected plasma and lung exposures at the selected doses have not featured in the prioritisation process. Although no antiviral data is currently available for the major phenolic circulating metabolite of nitazoxanide (known as tizoxanide), the parent ester drug has been shown to exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nitazoxanide is an anthelmintic drug and its metabolite tizoxanide has been described to have broad antiviral activity against influenza and other coronaviruses. The present study used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to inform optimal doses of nitazoxanide capable of maintaining plasma and lung tizoxanide exposures above the reported nitazoxanide 90% effective concentration (EC90) against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A whole-body PBPK model was constructed for oral administration of nitazoxanide and validated against available tizoxanide pharmacokinetic data for healthy individuals receiving single doses between 500 mg SARS-CoV-2 4000 mg with and without food. Additional validation against multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data when given with food was conducted. The validated model was then used to predict alternative doses expected to maintain tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported nitazoxanide EC90 in \u003E90% of the simulated population. Optimal design software PopDes was used to estimate an optimal sparse sampling strategy for future clinical trials. Results: The PBPK model was validated with AAFE values between 1.01 SARS-CoV-2 1.58 and a difference less than 2-fold between observed and simulated values for all the reported clinical doses. The model predicted optimal doses of 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg TID, 2900 mg BID in the fasted state and 700 mg QID, 900 mg TID and 1400 mg BID when given with food, to provide tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported in vitro EC90 of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2. For BID regimens an optimal sparse sampling strategy of 0.25, 1, 3 and 12h post dose was estimated. Conclusion: The PBPK model predicted that it was possible to achieve plasma and lung tizoxanide concentrations, using proven safe doses of nitazoxanide, that exceed the EC90 for SARS-CoV-2. The PBPK model describing tizoxanide plasma pharmacokinetics after oral administration of nitazoxanide was successfully validated against clinical data. This dose prediction assumes that the tizoxanide metabolite has activity against SARS-CoV-2 similar to that reported for nitazoxanide, as has been reported for other viruses. The model and the reported dosing strategies provide a rational basis for the design (optimising plasma and lung exposures) of future clinical trials of nitazoxanide in the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajoli, R.

Methods Three psychiatric centers in Paris and its suburbs took part in the study. We compared the number of total psychiatric emergency consultations during the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France to the corresponding 4 weeks in 2019. We also compared the number of consultations during these 4-week time periods in 2020 and 2019 across different diagnostic categories. Findings In the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France, 553 emergency psychiatry consultations were carried out, compared to 1224 consultations during the corresponding period of 2019, representing a 54.8 % decrease. This decrease was evident across all psychiatric disorders, including anxiety (number of consultations in 2020 representing 36.1 % of 2019), mood (41.1 %), and psychotic disorders (57.3 %). The number of suicide attempts also decreased (number of suicide attempts in 2020 representing 42.6 % of 2019). In comparison to 2019, the proportion of total consultations for anxiety disorders also decreased (16.6 % vs. 20.8 %), whilst the proportion of total consultations increased for psychotic disorders (31.1 % vs. 24.1 %). Conclusions The total number of psychiatric emergency consultations during lockdown dramatically decreased. The psychological consequences of lockdown may be delayed, indicating that psychiatric services should be prepared for a secondary increase in emergency presentations.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pignon, B.; Gourevitch, R.; Tebeka, S.; Dubertret, C.; Cardot, H.; Dauriac-Le Masson, V.; Trebalag, A.-K.; Barruel, D.; Yon, L.; Hemery, F.; Loric, M.; Rabu, C.; Pelissolo, A.; Leboyer, M.; Schurhoff, F.; Pham-Scottez, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22be16fc3cf7cc00b055c31ad5fd5f019019be9d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.19.20095901v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Paris","France"],"keyphrases":["number of consultations","number of total psychiatric emergency consultations","total number of psychiatric emergency consultations","psychiatric disorders","emergency psychiatry consultations","proportion of total consultations","psychiatric consequences","psychiatric centers","psychiatric services","number of suicide attempts","emergency presentations","associated lockdown","anxiety disorders","weeks","psychotic disorders","psychological consequences of lockdown","France","decrease","secondary increase","corresponding period","suburbs","pandemic","Conclusions","week time periods","COVID","Methods","different diagnostic categories","study","comparison","Findings","mood"],"language":"en"},

The network was constructed as a 2-dimensional Watts-Strogatz model (500x500 square lattice with additional shortcuts), and the dynamics involved rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic spread. The model of the epidemic is SIR with latency time of 3 time steps. The behaviour of the epidemic was checked over the range of shortcut probability per underlying bond 0-0.5. The quantity of interest was percolation threshold for the epidemic spread, for which numerical results were checked against an approximate analytical model. We find a significant lowering of percolation thresholds for the dynamic network in the parameter range given. The result shows that the behaviour of the epidemic on dynamic network is that of a static small world with the number of shortcuts increased by 20.7 \u002B/- 1.4%, while the overall qualitative behaviour stays the same. We derive corrections to the analytical model which account for the effect. For both dynamic and static small-world we observe suppression of the average epidemic size dependence on network size in comparison with finite-size scaling known for regular lattice. We also study the effect of dynamics for several rewiring rates relative to latency time of the disease.","publish_time":"2010-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ochab, J. K.; G\u0027ora, P.

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. NCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one. Since December 29, 2019, pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV, now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.

Here, we present our study elucidating the interplay between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses\u2019; and host\u2019s miRNAs, an epigenetic regulator, as a mode of pathogenesis, and enlightened how the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections differ in terms of their miRNA mediated interactions with host and its implications in the disease complexity. We have utilized computational approaches to predict potential host and viral miRNAs, and their possible roles in different important functional pathways. We have identified several putative host antiviral miRNAs that can target the SARS viruses, and also SARS viruses\u2019 encoded miRNAs targeting host genes. In silico predicted targets were also integrated with SARS infected human cells microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data. Comparison of the host miRNA binding profiles on 67 different SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 24 different countries with respective country\u2019s normalized death count surprisingly uncovered some miRNA clusters which are associated with increased death rates. We have found that induced cellular miRNAs can be both a boon and a bane to the host immunity, as they have possible roles in neutralizing the viral threat, parallelly, they can also function as proviral factors. On the other hand, from over representation analysis, interestingly our study revealed that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral miRNAs could target broad immune signaling pathways; only some of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are found to uniquely target some immune signaling pathways like-autophagy, IFN-I signaling etc, which might suggest their immune-escape mechanisms for prolonged latency inside some hosts without any symptoms of COVID-19. Further, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate several important cellular pathways which might lead to the increased anomalies in patients with comorbidities like-cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, breathing complications, etc. This might suggest that miRNAs can be a key epigenetic modulator behind the overcomplications amongst the COVID-19 patients. Our results support that miRNAs of host and SARS-CoV-2 can indeed play a role in the pathogenesis which can be further concluded with more experiments. These results will also be useful in designing RNA therapeutics to alleviate the complications from COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Md. Abdullah-Al-Kamran; Sany, Md.

Methods: We developed a piecewise fitting SEIR methodology to fit the progress of the COVID-19 that can be applied on any of the 185 countries listed in John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The contagious contact rate, the rate of removal and the initially exposed population were obtained at three different stages of the pandemic for a set of 18 countries, and globally for the total number of cases worldwide. The active number of infections and the removed populations were fitted simultaneously to validate the SEIR model against the available time series reports on the number of confirmed infections, recoveries and deaths. We evaluate the effect of a reduction of contagious contact rate on the level of burden put on local healthcare infrastructure considering different levels of intervention. As a guideline for future public health interventions, we also estimated the maximum number of future cases and its potential peak date. Findings: We project that the peak in the number of infections worldwide will take place after the third quarter of 2020 with a decline rate that might extend beyond 2020. For 12 out of the 18 countries analyzed, we observe that, following the trend at the date of this study, the number of severe infections will surpass their healthcare capacity. For a 90% reduction scenario of the contagious contact rate, four out of the 18 countries analyzed will undergo a significant delay in the peak of infection, extending the course of the epidemic further than our simulation window (365 days).

Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed. Results: Of 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P\u003C0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P\u003C0.05).

Here we examined the distribution of physical multimorbidity in relation to socioeconomic status; the association between physical multimorbidity, health-care service use, and catastrophic health expenditures; and whether these associations varied by socioeconomic group and social health insurance schemes. Methods In this population-based, panel data analysis, we used data from three waves of the nationally representative China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) for 2011, 2013, and 2015. We included participants aged 50 years and older in 2015, who had complete follow-up for the three waves. We used 11 physical non-communicable diseases to measure physical multimorbidity and annual per-capita household consumption spending as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Findings Of 17 708 participants in CHARLS, 11 817 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The median age of participants was 62 years (IQR 56\u201369) in 2015, and 5766 (48\u00B78%) participants were male. 7320 (61\u00B79%) eligible participants had physical multimorbidity in China in 2015. The prevalence of physical multimorbidity was increased with older age (odds ratio 2\u00B793, 95% CI 2\u00B771\u20133\u00B715), among women (2\u00B770, 2\u00B704\u20133\u00B757), within a higher socioeconomic group (for quartile 4 [highest group] 1\u00B750, 1\u00B724\u20131\u00B782), and higher educational level (5\u00B717, 3\u00B702\u20138\u00B783); however, physical multimorbidity was more common in poorer regions than in the more affluent regions. An additional chronic non-communicable disease was associated with an increase in the number of outpatient visits (incidence rate ratio 1\u00B729, 95% CI 1\u00B727\u20131\u00B731), and number of days spent in hospital as an inpatient (1\u00B738, 1\u00B735\u20131\u00B741). We saw similar effects in health service use of an additional chronic non-communicable disease in different socioeconomic groups and among those covered by different social health insurance programmes. Overall, physical multimorbidity was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure (for the overall population: odds ratio 1\u00B729, 95% CI 1\u00B726\u20131\u00B732, adjusted for sociodemographic variables). The effect of physical multimorbidity on catastrophic health expenditures persisted even among the higher socioeconomic groups and across all health insurance programmes. Interpretation Concerted efforts are needed to reduce health inequalities that are due to physical multimorbidity, and its adverse economic effect in population groups in China. Social health insurance reforms must place emphasis on reducing out-of-pocket spending for patients with multimorbidity to provide greater financial risk protection.

Objective: To determine the geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in the United States, as quantified by travel time. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing sites as of April 7, 2020 in relation to travel time. Setting: United States COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: The United States, including the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Exposures: Population density, percent minority, percent uninsured, and median income by county from the 2018 American Community Survey demographic data. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 testing sites identified in two national databases (Carbon Health and CodersAgainstCovid), geocoded by address. Median county 1 km2 gridded friction surface of travel times, as a measure of geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites. Results: 6,236 unique SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in 3,108 United States counties were identified. Thirty percent of the U.S. population live in a county (N = 1,920) with a median travel time over 20 minutes. This was geographically heterogeneous; 86% of the Mountain division population versus 5% of the Middle Atlantic population lived in counties with median travel times over 20 min. Generalized Linear Models showed population density, percent minority, percent uninsured and median income were predictors of median travel time to testing sites. For example, higher percent uninsured was associated with longer travel time (B= 0.41 min/percent, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.53, p = 1.2x10-12), adjusting for population density. Conclusions and Relevance: Geographic accessibility to SARS-Cov-2 testing sites is reduced in counties with lower population density and higher percent of minority and uninsured, which are also risk factors for worse healthcare access and outcomes. Geographic barriers to SARS-Cov-2 testing may exacerbate health inequalities and bias county-specific transmission estimates. Geographic accessibility should be considered when planning the location of future testing sites and interpreting epidemiological data.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rader, B.; Astley, C.

The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with greater strength than LPV. ATV blocked Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary monocytes, impairing virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 levels.

Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, shares the same cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) with SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide the route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. The failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by RSV or MERS-CoV and in mice treated by LPS. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream. This work provides new insights into SARS-CoV-2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Jieyu; Wei, Xiangxiang; Li, Qinhan; Li, Liliang; Yang, Zhaohua; Shi, Yu; Qin, Yue; Zhang, Xinyue; Wang, Xinhong; Zhi, Xiuling; Meng, Dan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cdceb3cf6324b569f5b4cda124a427648f082c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20047621","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","ACE2 expression","patients","bloodstream","higher percentage of ACE2","heart failure","fibrotic lungs","type specific expression of ACE2","failed human hearts","heart injury","cardiomyocytes","pathogen of COVID","organs","failed adult human hearts","unbiased evaluation of cell","cell receptor Angiotensin","characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis","pathological investigation of COVID","higher risk","virus infection","published single-cell RNA-seq data","arterial vascular cells","pathogenicity","accounting","high infectivity","global pandemic","enzyme","blood entry","tens of thousands","therapeutic strategy","new insights","spreads","deaths","work","mice","findings","RSV","route","severe complications","Recent studies","LPS"],"language":"en"},

In this work we assessed how the innate immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of RNA virus infections. We demonstrate that type III interferons produced by dendritic cells in the lung in response to viral recognition cause barrier damage and compromise the host tissue tolerance. In particular, type III interferons inhibit tissue repair and lung epithelial cell proliferation, causing susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. Overall, our data give a strong mandate to rethink the pathophysiological roles of this group of interferons and their possible use in the clinical practice against endemic as well as emerging viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broggi, Achille; Ghosh, Sreya; Sposito, Benedetta; Spreafico, Roberto; Balzarini, Fabio; Lo Cascio, Antonino; Clementi, Nicola; De Santis, Maria; Mancini, Nicasio; Granucci, Francesca; Zanoni, Ivan","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.077867","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging viral infections","pathogenesis of RNA virus infections","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza virus","group of interferons","innate immune response","aberrant immune response","type","viral burden","Lower respiratory tract infections","viral recognition cause barrier damage","tissue repair","clinical practice","lethal cases","RNA viruses","leading cause of mortality","host tissue tolerance","lethal bacterial superinfections","lung epithelial cell proliferation","susceptibility","new pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV","endemic","possible use","pathophysiological roles","dendritic cells","strong mandate","infectious agents","experimental evidence","data","work"],"language":"en"},

Main outcome measures: Confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching and becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, and adherence to protective behaviours. Socioeconomic position was defined according to highest level of education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no). Results: Compared with never smokers (0.3% [95%CI 0.2-0.3%]), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.6% [0.4-0.8%]) but not ex-smokers (0.2% [0.2-0.3%]). The associations were similar before (current: OR 2.14 [1.49-3.08]; ex-smokers: OR 0.73 [0.47-1.14]) and after (current: OR 1.79 [1.22-2.62]; ex-smokers: OR 0.85 [0.54-1.33]) adjustment for potential confounders. For current smokers, this was moderated by socioeconomic position, with higher rates relative to never smokers only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR 3.53 [2.04-6.10]).

More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration. Conclusions: COVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, the severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Wen; Yu, Shikai; Zha, Xiangyi; Wang, Ning; Pang, Qiumei; Li, Tongzeng; Li, Aixin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e8c0f688ed1bb4899c86d4a3bb86d0a3e72c9ae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035436","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cox"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["discharged patients","severe patients","longer hospitalization duration of COVID","shorter duration of disease","duration of exposure","hospitalized duration","severity of disease","specific characteristics of COVID","different durations of COVID","admission","Hospital length","lymphopenia","study endpoint","shorter time","potential risk factors","bilateral pneumonia","CT scan","shorter period of illness onset","clinical characteristics","Beijing YouAn Hospital","retrospective study","complications","males","days","Cox proportional-hazards regression","average time","SARS-CoV","Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model","recovery","radiological data","increasing global threat","public health","information","years","overall cumulative probability","great value","mean age","infections","Methods","weeks","outcomes","laboratory","end of follow-up","Background","Conclusions","Results","comorbidities"],"language":"en"},

The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes.

The country had been under a strict lockdown since 20 March 2020, and currently the lockdown is being relaxed gradually. The objective of this paper is to describe a projection model for COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka applied to different scenarios after lockout, utilizing the stringency index as a proxy of total government response. Methods COVID-19 Stringency Index (C19SI) is published and updated real time by a research group from Oxford university on 17 selected mitigation and suppression measures employed by different countries. We have mapped and validated the stringency index for Sri Lanka and subsequently validated the projection model in two phases. Predictions for the base-case scenario, less stringent scenarios, advanced relaxation scenarios, and high-risk districts were done with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using the validated model, utilizing data up to 10th May. Results C19SI was able to accommodate all of the government responses. The model using validated C19SI could predict number of cases with 95% confidence for a period of two weeks. The model predicted base-case scenario of 815 (95%CI, 753-877) active cases by 17 May 2020 and 648 (95%CI, 599-696) cases for the high-risk districts by 18 May 2020. The model further predicted 3,159 (95%CI, 2,928-3,391) cases for 75% stringency and 928,824 (95%CI, 861,772-995,877) cases for 50% stringency. Advancing normalcy by three weeks resulted in the case load increasing to 4526 (95%CI, 4309-4744) by 30 June 2020. Conclusion The proposed prediction model based on C19SI provides policy makers an evidence based scientific method for identifying suppression measures that can be relaxed at the most appropriate time.

Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P\u003C0.001).

It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset in order to avoid being falsely reassured by negative tests. As such, the goal of our study was to estimate the false negative rate by day since infection. We used previously published data on RT-PCR sensitivity on samples derived from nasal swabs by day since symptom onset (n=633) and fit a cubic polynomial spline to calculate the false negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. Over the four days of infection prior to the typical time of symptom onset (day 5) the probability of a false negative test in an infected individual falls from 100% on day one (95% CI 69-100%) to 61% on day four (95% CI 18-98%), though there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers. On the day of symptom onset, the median false negative rate was 39% (95% CI 16-77%). This decreased to 26% (95% CI 18-34%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset), then began to rise again, from 27% (95% CI 20-34%) on day 9 to 61% (95% CI 54-67%) on day 21. Care must be taken when interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly if performed early in the course of infection, when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If there is high clinical suspicion, patients should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kucirka, Lauren; Lauer, Stephen; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Boon, Denali; Lessler, Justin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20051474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["day of symptom onset","negative tests","typical time of symptom onset","false negative test","RT-PCR tests","days of infection","median false negative rate","RT-PCR sensitivity","basis of RT","course of infection","exposure","SARS-CoV","high clinical suspicion","nasal swabs","samples","exposed inpatients","infected individual falls","probability","high-risk individuals","precautions","published data","cubic polynomial spline","healthcare workers","predictive value","results","study","order","considerable uncertainty","numbers","onward transmission","epidemiologic situation","goal"],"language":"en"},

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (\u226560 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8\u002BT cells or CD4\u002BT cells lower than 800/\u03BCL, 300/\u03BCL, or 400/\u03BCL, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03B1 concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03B1 concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8\u002BT cells CD4\u002BT cells counts lower than 800/\u03BCL, 300/\u03BCL, and 400/\u03BCL, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diao, Bo; Wang, Chenhui; Tan, Yingjun; Chen, Xiewan; Liu, Ying; Ning, Lifeng; Chen, Li; Li, Min; Liu, Yueping; Wang, Gang; Yuan, Zilin; Feng, Zeqing; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4609a2dd3568a7241548b7303e0d836e33d4d5ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["T cells CD4","T cells lower","surviving T cells","counts of total T cells","number of total T cells","T cell numbers","T cell subsets","restored T cell counts","CONCLUSIONS T cell counts","indicative of T cell exhaustion","COVID","\u03BCL","expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD","elderly patients","Non-ICU patients","CD8","reduced IL","serum IL","health controls","Tim","exhausted marker PD","human health","hospitals","serum cytokine concentration","TNF-\u03B1 concentrations","severe symptoms","healthy controls","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","public health emergency of international concern","Intensive Care Unit","outbreak of coronavirus disease","antiviral immunity","inpatient data","functional state","higher levels","critical role","decline period","immediate absence","high risk","symptomatic stages","SARS-CoV","peripheral blood","PHEIC","laboratory","years of age","Statistical analysis","flow cytometry","great threat","aggressive intervention","deterioration","condition","routine physical examination","BACKGROUND","addition","cases","patient survival","Wuhan","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 \u2013 60 d of age), and carryover effects on post-weaning (61 \u2013 90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein \u00D7 Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 \u00B1 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly to determinate \u00DF-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and acetate:proprionate proportion - C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre and post-weaning (P \u2264 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil (P \u2264 0.001) and platelet (P \u2264 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P \u2264 0.001), revealing a long-term treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P \u2264 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. BEO contributed for ruminal manipulation on pre-weaning and carry over effect on post-weaning; immunity improvement and a decrease morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in pre-weaning phase.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campolina, Joana P.; Coelho, Sandra G.; Belli, Anna Luiza; Machado, Fernanda S.; Pereira, Luiz G.

We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We show that the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20% of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that made part of their resources available for global use.","publish_time":"2007-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colizza, Vittoria; Barrat, Alain; Barthelemy, Marc; Valleron, Alain-Jacques; Vespignani, Alessandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adae39fea7d473e279cfffb02a95617e2bd5d65c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0701038v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global use","reproductive rate","different countries","global scale","global level","air travel","pandemic influenza","pandemic effect","AV supply use sufficient","different containment strategies","therapeutic use of antiviral","unrealistic use of supplies","case of limited AV supplies","travel restrictions","possible containment","large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs","containment results","urban areas","hit countries","occurrence probability of global outbreaks","airline travel flow data","available information","resources available","geographical impact","sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness","efficient case detection","inclusion of air transportation","pandemics","assessment","account","initial outbreak conditions","timely drug distribution","conjunction","year","metapopulation stochastic epidemic model","timeline","worldwide spread","baseline cases","spatial evolution","regions","contagious viruses","spreading scenario","strategy","study","treatment"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P\u003C0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P\u003C0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR\u0026RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR\u0026RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923).

Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to mitigate the number of infected and deaths. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission.

The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus.

Coronaviruses such as the 2003 SARS-CoV showed an increased risk of transmission during cooler days. We sought to analyse the effects of ambient temperature on SARS-COV-2 transmission and deaths related to the virus. Methods The world population of COVID-19 cases and attributable deaths from the 23rd January 2020 to 11th April 2020 were analysed. Temperature 5 days before cases and 23 days prior to deaths (to account for the time lag of incubation period and time from symptoms to death) was compared to the average temperature experienced by the world population. Results The total number of cases during this period was 1,605,788 and total number of deaths was 103,471. The median temperature at the time of COVID-19 infection was 9.12C (10-90th percentile 4.29-17.97C) whilst the median temperature of the world population for the same period was 9.61C warmer at 18.73C (10-90th percentile 4.09-28.49C) with a notional p-value = 5.1 x10-11.

They cause important diseases in mammals and birds ranging from enteritis in cows and pigs and upper respiratory disease in chickens, to potentially lethal human respiratory infections. Here, we apply ribosome profiling and parallel RNA sequencing to analyse global changes in host cell transcriptome and translatome upon infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), a model murine coronavirus in the same genus as the human pathogens severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Amongst differentially-regulated cellular genes, we observed up-regulation of all arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including translational activation of transcription factors ATF4, ATF5 and Chop. Polysome profiling of infected-cells revealed an accumulation of empty 80S ribosomes, consistent with increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 leading to translational shut-off via inhibited initiation. Ribosomal footprints on phosphorylated-eIF2\u03B1-resistant mRNAs revealed unambiguous upstream open reading frame (uORF) occupancy consistent with host maintenance of the UPR. Unexpectedly, an inhibitor of PERK that blocks the UPR and relieves translation inhibition was found to attenuate virus growth suggesting that MHV may subvert the UPR to its own advantage. This study sheds new light on the complex interactions between MHV and host during infection and provides new potential targets for antiviral intervention.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cook, Georgia M.; Brown, Katherine; Franaszek, Krzysztof; Moore, Nathan A.; Siddell, Stuart G.; Brierley, Ian; Firth, Andrew E.; Irigoyen, Nerea","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c17c6f5e434f1d8227c9d8c5f9da26200364491.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/292979","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","MHV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["UPR","MHV-A59","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","human pathogens severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","upper respiratory disease","host maintenance","lethal human respiratory infections","large RNA genome","parallel RNA sequencing","host cell transcriptome","model murine coronavirus","SARS-CoV","occupancy consistent","MERS-CoV","phosphorylated-eIF2\u03B1","translational shut","positive-sense RNA viruses","virus growth","ribosome profiling","mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","new potential targets","Polysome profiling of infected","study sheds new light","translational activation of transcription factors ATF4","uORF","unambiguous upstream open reading frame","resistant mRNAs","translatome","global changes","genus","complex interactions","chickens","cows","pigs","birds","enteritis","ATF5","S ribosomes","unique replication strategy","unfolded protein response","mammals","arms","accumulation","Chop","cells","antiviral intervention","Ribosomal footprints","translation inhibition","regulation","important diseases","inhibited initiation","CoVs","inhibitor of PERK"],"language":"en"},

Effective therapeutic drugs are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis of patients, but currently no such drugs are available. Methods Patients in the study were divided into a heparin and a control group based on whether low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used. D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage, interleukin-6, and other indices in 42 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed to compare and evaluate the progress of patients before and after LMWH treatment. Results Compared to the control group, D-dimer levels in the heparin group significantly increased before treatment, and there was no significant difference after treatment. There was no significant difference in the change of CRP levels between the two groups of patients before and after LMWH treatment, and levels for both groups were significantly lower after, compared to before, treatment. Compared to the control group, patients in the heparin group had a higher percentage of lymphocytes after treatment and lower levels of interleukin-6; these differences were statistically significant. Conclusions Under conventional antiviral treatment regimens, LMWH can improve hypercoagulability, inhibit IL-6 release, and counteract IL-6 biological activity in patients. LMWH has potential antiviral effects and can help delay or block inflammatory cytokine storms. It can also increase the lymphocytes (LYM%)of patients and has the potential for treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"SHI, C.; WANG, C.; WANG, H.; YANG, C.; CAI, F.; ZENG, F.; CHENG, F.; LIU, Y.; ZHOU, T.; DENG, B.; LI, J.; ZHANG, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8a3c1fcef5f6368eb1d55864373bb44c19b7db8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.28.20046144v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","LMWH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LMWH treatment","groups of patients","treatment of COVID","heparin group","Methods Patients","progress of patients","control group","overall prognosis of patients","conventional antiviral treatment regimens","D-dimer levels","lower levels of interleukin","significant difference","change of CRP levels","low molecular weight heparin","higher percentage of lymphocytes","potential antiviral effects","assessment of COVID","Effective therapeutic drugs","peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage","C-reactive protein","hypercoagulability","World Health Organization","indices","Conclusions","novel coronavirus pneumonia","release","biological activity","study","inflammatory cytokine storms","Background","global pandemic","differences","Results"],"language":"en"},

This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host-response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes\u2019 expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4-phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Jong, Tristan; Guryev, Victor; Moshkin, Yury M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf05c74c5d0778e1f4c7868b13d5f0318407a351.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of ensemble gene noise","interpretation of gene expression disbalance","coherent expression of gene circuits","level of gene networks","ensemble genes\u2019 expression","average noise","turn obscures differential gene expression analysis","inter-individual variability of gene expression responses","sepsis patients","sepsis pathology","CAP","analysis of H1N1 influenza","protein complexes relevant","law of total variance","number of pathways","biological pathways","subunits of annotated protein complexes","clinical outcomes","host-response","molecular nature","collection of genes","specific genes","DGE approaches","investigation of molecular mechanisms","heterogenous response of individuals","prediction of clinical outcome","holistic identification","promising approach","community","mortality","human pathologies","stoichiometry","prism of alterations","common disturbances","members","hospital","pneumonia","increase","methylene blue","novel biomarkers","pandemic","mitochondrial respiratory chain","peroxisomes","adjuvant treatment","alternative","disease","infection","systems","midst","COVID","phenylbutyrate","end"],"language":"en"},

In rotor-stator cavities, the centrifugal and Coriolis forces have a strong influence on the turbulence by producing a secondary flow in the meridian plane composed of two thin boundary layers along the disks separated by a non-viscous geostrophic core. Most numerical simulations have been performed using RANS and URANS modelling, and very few investigations have been performed using LES. This paper reports on quantitative comparisons of two high-order LES methods to predict a turbulent rotor-stator flow at the rotational Reynolds number Re=400000. The classical dynamic Smagorinsky model for the subgrid-scale stress (Germano et al., Phys Fluids A 3(7):1760-1765, 1991) is compared to a spectral vanishing viscosity technique (S\\\u0027everac\u0026Serre, J Comp Phys 226(2):1234-1255, 2007). Numerical results include both instantaneous data and postprocessed statistics. The results show that both LES methods are able to accurately describe the unsteady flow structures and to satisfactorily predict mean velocities as well as Reynolds stress tensor components. A slight advantage is given to the spectral SVV approach in terms of accuracy and CPU cost. The strong improvements obtained in the present results with respect to RANS results confirm that LES is the appropriate level of modelling for flows in which fully turbulent and transition regimes are involved.","publish_time":"2013-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viazzo, St\u0027ephane; Poncet, S\u0027ebastien; Serre, Eric; Randriamampianina, Anthony; Bontoux, Patrick","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2885v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Smagorinsky"],"organizations":["RANS","LES","Reynolds","J Comp Phys"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RANS results","Numerical results","turbulent rotor-stator flow","secondary flow","present results","investigation of rotating turbulent flow","unsteady flow structures","methods","rotor-stator cavities","Reynolds stress tensor components","strong influence","Phys Fluids","strong improvements","URANS modelling","numerical simulations","subgrid-scale stress","spectral SVV approach","rotational Reynolds number","J Comp Phys","appropriate level of modelling","spectral vanishing viscosity technique","everac","terms of accuracy","Coriolis forces","disks","Serre","Germano","flows","instantaneous data","mean velocities","classical dynamic Smagorinsky model","industrial applications","meridian plane","quantitative comparisons","turbulence","respect","non-viscous geostrophic core","paper reports","boundary layers","CPU cost","postprocessed statistics","engineering","slight advantage","transition regimes","investigations"],"language":"en"},

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian nonlinear mixed model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectory. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for infections and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluate forecasting accuracy on a two-week holdout set, finding that the model predicts COVID-19 cases and deaths well, with a mean absolute scaled error of 0.40 for cases and 0.32 for deaths throughout the two-week evaluation period. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Ohio, and Mississippi. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watson, G.

We describe the control measures used and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers. Methods: Data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of control measures were captured by Vietnam\u0027s National Steering Committee for COVID-19 response. Apple and Google mobility data provided population movement proxies. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers. Results: After the first confirmed case on January 23rd, the Vietnamese Government initiated mass communications measures, contact tracing, mandatory 14-day quarantine, school and university closures, and progressive flight restrictions. A national lockdown was implemented between April 1st and 22nd. Around 200,000 people were quarantined and 266,122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89/208) of resolved infections were asymptomatic. 21 developed severe disease, with no deaths. The serial interval was 3.24 days, and 27.5% (95% confidence interval, 15.7%-40.0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-2.36). No community transmission has been detected since April 15th. Conclusions: Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of communication, contact-tracing, quarantine, and international travel restrictions. The value of these interventions is supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic cases and imported cases, and evidence for substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pham, T.

Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a L\u00E9vy flight which is characteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient quarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close to constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most cities in China control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less social interactions control and overloaded health systems which reflects in the death and recovery rates.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gross, Bnaya; Zheng, Zhiguo; Liu, Shiyan; Chen, Xiaoqi; Sela, Alon; Li, Jianxin; Li, Daqing; Havlin, Shlomo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35618a8711c976d25fa6daf5f20311822150df96.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041517","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China","disease propagation","COVID","city level","world-wide locations","cities","results","means","social interactions control","spatio-temporal propagation","infection signs","infection rate","world-wide countries","social distancing","later times","early times","stages process","global locations","efficient quarantines","L\u00E9vy flight","population migration","overloaded health systems","Hubei","death","infected individuals","order","days","decaying stage","significant differences","characteristic of human mobility","lack","situation","recovery rates","vaccination","medicine","new coronavirus","insight","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Methods For this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from hospital records. Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise patients, including medians, percentiles and frequencies. Differences were tested with Mann Whitney U-test and Pearson\u0027s chi-square test. Results Pre-existent obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was present in 29% of patients admitted in the hospital for Covid-19, none of them having severe OSA. Overall, other findings on admission were comparable with those reported elsewhere. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg/L versus 52 mg/L, p\u003C0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower oxygen saturation on admission in ICU-patients (87% versus 93%, p=0.09). Discussion OSA was pre-existent in a disproportional large group of patients, which suggests that it is an important risk factor for severe Covid-19.

Free energy of spread on a given day is defined equal to the natural logarithm of the number of infected cases. Dissipation of propagation is obtained using a postulated form of free energy built using thermodynamics of irreversible processes in analogy to isotherm wave propagation in solids and elastic damage behaviour of materials. The proposed expression of daily free energy rate leads to dissipation of propagation introducing a parameter quantifying measures taking by governments to restrict transmission. Entropy daily rate representing disorder produced in the initial system is also explicitly defined. In this context, a simple law of evolution of infected cases as function of time is given in an iterative form. The model predicts different effects on peak of infected cases Imax and epidemic period, including effects of population size N, effects of measures taking to restrict spread, effects of population density and effect of a parameter T similar to absolute temperature in thermodynamics. Different effects are presented first. The model is than applied to epidemic spread in Tunisia and compared with data registered since the report of the first confirmed case on Mar 2, 2020.

The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing. The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. The data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. By fitting the model with the data, we reveal that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and 18.2% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA. Finally, an assessment of the relative effectiveness of active intervention and personal protective measures is discussed. With a highly vigilant public maintaining personal hygiene and exercising strict protective measures, the percentage of population infected can be further reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhan, Choujun; Tse, Chi K.; Lai, Zhikang; Chen, Xiaoyun; Mo, Mingshen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5a4665dbf23935e054846f40619e09ea10b09a1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043380","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["number of infected cases","USA","actual number of infected individuals","model","implementation of active intervention","elevated active intervention","different levels of active intervention","intercity travel data","number of confirmed cases","relative effectiveness of active intervention","number of people","regions of Japan","data fitting","different levels of intervention","fold","consideration of intercity travel","personal protective measures","infection cases","pandemic progression","spreading progression","COVID","strict protective measures","future progression profiles","personal hygiene","parameters relative","movement of exposed","realistic prediction","percentage of population","New Coronavirus Disease","fewer","cities","states","values","SEICR","vigilant public","insufficient testing","federal district","assessment","account","Results"],"language":"en"},

Compared against other mitigation measures that are implemented simultaneously and in equal strength across cities our method has three major particularities when: Accounts for city commute and health infrastructure: It takes into account the daily commute among cities to estimate the dynamics of infected people while keeping the number of infected people within a desired level at each city avoiding the collapse of its health care system. City-specific control: It allows for orchestrating the control measures among cities so as to prevent all cities to face the same level control. The model tends to induce alternation between periods of stricter controls and periods of a more normal life in each city and among the cities. Flexible scenarios: It is flexible enough to allow for simulating the impact of particular actions. For example, one can simulate the how the control all cities change when the number of care beds increases in specific places. Therefore, our method creates an automatic dance adjusting mitigation levels within cities and alternating among cities as suggested in~cite{Pue2020}. This automatic dance may help the city economy and orchestration of resources. We provide case studies using the major cities of the state of Sao Paulo given by using estimates on the daily mobility among the cities their health care system capacity. We use official data in our case studies. However, sub-notification of infected people in Brazil is notoriously high. Hence the case study should not be considered as a real world policy suggestion. It high sub-notification is taken into account, the optimal control algorithm will suggest stricter mitigation measures, as also shown in the case studies. Surprisingly, the total duration of the protocol for the state is barely affected by the sub-notification, but the severity of such protocols is strengthened. This stresses a twofold implication, first, the protocol depends on high-quality data and, second, such optimal and orchestrated protocol is robust and can be adjusted to the demand.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, P.

Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP \u226520 mg/L and lymphocyte count\u003C 1.1*10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury.

To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings. METHODS: We included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies. RESULTS: Where specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I2 29%, low certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 2 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person(OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I2 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence). DISCUSSION: Based on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brainard, Julii Suzanne; Jones, Natalia; Lake, Iain; Hooper, Lee; Hunter, Paul","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RCTs","observational studies","widespread use of facemasks","low certainty evidence","low uncertainty evidence","protective effect","eligible studies","protective measure","primary prevention","support","primary infection","infected person","household members","infected household member","odds of developing ILI","use of medical grade","secondary prevention trials","rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence","household infections","community settings","I2","Results","development of respiratory illness","casual community contact","GRADE quality assessment","high quality trials","respiratory symptoms","uninfected members","current pandemic of COVID","random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates","vulnerable individuals","contacts","short periods of time","under-estimate","transient higher risk situations","surgical paper masks","favour","type of face barrier","Narrative synthesis","similar outcomes","influenza","specific information","health care facilities","poor compliance","index patient","house-mates","preferred outcome","controls","Greater effectiveness","conflicting opinions","METHODS","study designs","DISCUSSION","value"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Qualitative study comprising five focus groups carried out online during the early stages of the UK\u0027s social distancing and isolation measures (5-12 days post lockdown). SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants, all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. RESULTS: The social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had having substantial negative impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of the UK public within a short time of policy implementation. It has disproportionately negatively affected those in low-paid or precarious employment. Practical social and economic losses - the loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine - led to psychological and emotional \u0027losses\u0027 - the loss of motivation, loss of meaning, and loss of self-worth. Participants reported high adherence to distancing and isolation guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others. A central concern for participants was the uncertainty duration of the measures, and their ability to cope longer-term. Some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Initial high levels of support for, and adherence to, social distancing and isolation is likely to wane over time, particularly where end dates are uncertain. Social distancing and isolation \u0027exit strategies\u0027 must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williams, Simon N; Armitage, Christopher J; Tampe, Tova; Dienes, Kimberly","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fa7ee3875df4ae620f680318d5878057109c42d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social isolation measures","UK\u0027s social distancing","social interaction","social contact","UK public of social distancing","high levels of social activity","high levels of social engagement","isolation guidelines","loss of income","loss of structure","loss of meaning","loss of motivation","loss of self-worth","high adherence","mental health impacts of COVID","Initial high levels of support","Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS","terms of public health programming","UK residents","hearing of non-adherence","short time of policy implementation","substantial negative impacts","range of gender","routine","experiences","wellbeing","rapid response","uncertainty duration","early stages","Qualitative study","focus groups","years","losses\u0027","SETTING","perceptions","lingering concerns","economic losses","person","strategies\u0027","occupational backgrounds","central concern","DESIGN","CONCLUSIONS","end dates","days post lockdown","RESULTS","precarious employment","fact","OBJECTIVE","ability","distance","individuals","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

This has hampered the ability to ascertain true infection numbers, evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance strategies, determine transmission dynamics, and estimate reproductive numbers. Leveraging both viral genomic and time series case data offers methods to estimate these parameters. Using a Bayesian inference framework to fit a branching process model to viral phylogeny and time series case data, we estimated time-varying reproductive numbers and their variance, the total numbers of infected individuals, the probability of case detection over time, and the estimated time to detection of an outbreak for 12 locations in Europe, China, and the United States. The median percentage of undetected infections ranged from 13% in New York to 92% in Shanghai, China, with the length of local transmission prior to two cases being detected ranging from 11 days (95% CI: 4-21) in California to 37 days (9-100) in Minnesota. The probability of detection was as low as 1% at the start of local epidemics, increasing as the number of reported cases increased exponentially. The precision of estimates increased with the number of full-length viral genomes in a location. The viral phylogeny was informative of the variance in the reproductive number with the 32% most infectious individuals contributing 80% of total transmission events. This is the first study that incorporates both the viral genomes and time series case data in the estimation of undetected COVID-19 infections. Our findings suggest the presence of undetected infections broadly and that superspreading events are contributing less to observed dynamics than during the SARS epidemic in 2003.

Due to a high level of uncertainty and lack of essential data, standard models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. Although the literature includes several attempts to address this issue, the essential generalization and robustness abilities of existing models needs to be improved.

There is an urgent need to understand patient characteristics of having COVID-19 disease and evaluate markers of critical illness and mortality. Objective: To assess association of clinical features on patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this observational case series, patient-level data were extracted from electronic medical records for 28,336 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Mount Sinai Health System from 2/24/ to 4/15/2020, including 6,158 laboratory-confirmed cases. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR assay from nasal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effects of race on positive test rates and mortality were assessed. Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N = 3,273), effects of patient demographics, hospital site and unit, social behavior, vital signs, lab results, and disease comorbidities on discharge and death were estimated. Results: Hispanics (29%) and African Americans (25%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to population base rates (p\u003C2e-16); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in the hospital. Outcome differed significantly between hospitals (Gray\u0027s T=248.9; p\u003C2e-16), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR=1.05 [95% CI, 1.04-1.06]; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR=0.985 [95% CI, 0.982-0.988]; p=1.57e-17), care in ICU areas (HR=1.58 [95% CI, 1.29-1.92]; p=7.81e-6), and elevated creatinine (HR=1.75 [95% CI, 1.47-2.10]; p=7.48e-10), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (HR=1.002, [95% CI 1.001-1.003]; p=8.86e-5) and body-mass index (BMI) (HR=1.02, [95% CI 1.00-1.03]; p=1.09e-2). Asthma (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.62-0.98]; p=0.031) was significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay, but not mortality. Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation. Baseline age, BMI, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine, and ALT were significant prognostic indicators of mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find a racial disparity in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races. We identified clinical features associated with reduced mortality and discharge. These findings could help to identify which COVID-19 patients are at greatest risk and evaluate the impact on survival.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Z.; Zheutlin, A.

Methods: Eleven of 1453 patients with a probable diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively selected for the presence of PE. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. All cross-sectional CT imaging was qualitatively scored for the first 28 days after onset of symptoms. Results: Of 24 patients underwent CTA-PE, 11 were confirmed with PE. All 11 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We observed an evolution pattern of predominant findings with ground-glass opacities (GGO) to GGO with crazy paving in 3 patients, then to consolidation with linear densities, or to reticulation in 9 patients. Lung cysts or traction bronchiectasis could be seen from day 5 to 9 after symptoms and reticulation, subpleural curvilinear lines were more common from day 20. The pulmonary opacities were predominantly peripheral in distribution with relative sparing of nondependent lungs. The severity of lung involvement was high with an average score of 9.7 in the first phase, 18 in the second phase plateauing in the next two phases, with a slight decrease to 16.9 in the late phase.

The small ~30kb single-stranded RNA genome of Coronaviruses makes them adept at cross species spread and drift, increasing their probability to cause pandemics. However, this small genome also allows for a robust understanding of all proteins coded by the virus. We employed protein modeling, molecular dynamic simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome and dynamicome understanding of SARS-CoV-2. The Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD) has been established (prokoplab.com/vistedd), opening future discoveries and educational usage. In this paper, we highlight VIStEDD usage for nsp6, Nucleocapsid (N), and Spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N we reveal highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we have developed a quantitative dynamics cross correlation matrix insight into interaction with the ACE2/SLC6A19 dimer complex. From this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from population genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/TMPRSS2, warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Two noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) found in ~9% of African descent individuals for ACE2 may regulate expression and be related to increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2.

Aim: We aimed to investigate the internet search behavior related to COVID-19 and the extent of infodemic monikers circulating in Google and Instagram during the pandemic period in the world. Methods: Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags (#), we explored the internet search activities and behaviors related to COVID-19 pandemic all over the world from February 20, 2020, to May 06, 2020. Briefly, we investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and also information related to the adoption of infodemic monikers related to COVID-19. We computed the average peak volume (APC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) during the study period. Results: The top five COVID-19 related terms used in Google searches were \u0022coronavirus\u0022, \u0022corona\u0022, \u0022COVID\u0022, \u0022virus\u0022, \u0022corona virus\u0022, and \u0022COVID-19\u0022.

India is a large country, with a highly variable inter-state mobility, and dynamically varying infection cases in different locations; thus, the existing models, based solely on the aspects of growth rates, or generalized network concepts, may not provide desired predictions. The internal mobility of a country must be considered, for accurate prediction. Herein, we propose a framework for predicting the geographical spread of COVID-19, using reported COVID-19 cases, census migration data, and monthly airline data of passengers. We discover that spreading depends on the spatial distribution of existing cases, human mobility patterns, and administrative decisions. In India, the mobility towards professional sites can surge incoming cases at Maharastra and Karnataka, while migration towards the native places can risk Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. We anticipate that the state Kerala, with one of the highest cases of COVID-19, may not receive significant incoming cases, while Karnataka and Haryana may receive the challenge of high incoming cases, with medium cases so far. Using airline passenger\u0027s data, we also estimate the number of potential incoming cases at various airports. The study predicts that the airports located in the region of north India are vulnerable, whereas in northeast India and in some south India are relatively safe.

However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes.

The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent COVID-19 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of COVID-19 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. Based on the target cell model, COVID-19 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for COVID-19 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection.

The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu.

With COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) spreading around the world, this rapid review aims to answer that question and thus to promote evidence-based decision making in health education policy and practice. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on health education during COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome) epidemics in Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CBM (China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Data from their inception until March 31, 2020. The potential bias of the studies was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool. Results: Of 1067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people\u0027s knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases. Health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites. Conclusions: For educating and cultivating children, parents should obtain information from the official websites of authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national Centers for Disease Control, or from other sources endorsed by these authorities, rather than from a general search of the internet or social media.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, W.; Liao, J.; Li, Q.; Baskota, M.; Wang, X.; Tang, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Luo, X.; Ma, Y.; Fukuoka, T.; Ahn, H.

This study was aimed at describing clinical characteristics and outcomes of admitted patients with mild COVID-19 illness in the initial phase of pandemic in India. Design - Retrospective (observational ) study. Setting - COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi, where, isolation facilities were designed to manage patients with mild illness and dedicated COVID ICUs was created to cater patients with moderate to severe illness. Participants - Patients aged 18 years or more, with confirmed illness were eligible for enrolment. Patients who were either asymptomatic or mildly ill at presentation were included. Patients with moderate to severe illness at admission, or incomplete clinical symptomatology records were excluded. Methods - Data regarding demographic profile, comorbidities, clinical features, hospital course, treatment, details of results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 done at baseline and at day 14, chest radiographs (wherever available) as well as laboratory parameters was obtained retrospectively from the hospital records. Main outcome measures - Final outcome was noted in terms of course of the disease, patients discharged, still admitted (at time of conclusion of study) or death. Results -Out of 231 cases included, majority were males(78.3%) with a mean age of 39.8 years. Comorbidities were present in 21.2% of patients, diabetes mellitus and hypertension being most common. The most common symptoms were dry cough(81, 35%), fever(64, 27.7%), sore throat(36, 15.6%), and dyspnoea(24, 10.4%); asymptomatic infection was noted in 108(46.8%) patients.

We propose a model in which individuals that are infected with one disease are more likely to acquire the second disease, both diseases following the susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction scheme. We analyze cooperative coinfection in stochastic network models as well as the idealized, well-mixed mean field system and show that cooperative mechanisms dramatically change the nature of phase transitions compared to single disease dynamics. We show that, generically, cooperative coinfection exhibits discontinuous transitions from the disease free to high prevalence state when a critical transmission rate is crossed. Furthermore, cooperative coinfection exhibits two distinct critical points, one for outbreaks the second one for eradication that can be substantially lower. This implies that cooperative coinfection exhibits hysteresis in its response to changing effective transmission rates or equivalently the basic reproduction number. We compute these critical parameters as a function of a cooperativity coefficient in the well-mixed mean field system. We finally investigate a spatially extended version of the model and show that cooperative interactions between diseases change the general wave propagation properties of conventional spreading phenomena of single diseases.

Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan. Methods We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria. Findings 209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant, radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments/day were performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments/day post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected. Interpretation Herein, we show that in a susceptible population to COVID-19, strict infection control measures can curb human-to-human transmission, and ensure timely delivery of RT to cancer patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Conghua; Wang, Xiaoyong; Liu, Hui; Bao, Zhirong; Yu, Jing; Zhong, Yahua; Chua, Melvin LK","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abeef69684548150bb62ab5924dfcb2e0b99f88e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20037051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["majority of patients","gynaecological cancer patients","management of cancer patients","early outcomes of patients","suspect COVID","Diagnosis of COVID","treatments","strict infection control measures","higher risk of COVID","RT facility","infection rate","Wuhan city","city lock","tertiary cancer centre","timely delivery of RT","healthcare staff","neck","head","day","study period","protection of healthcare workers","human transmission","Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University","on-site screening","modifications","novel corona virus disease","cases","radiotherapy","Primary end-point","pandemic","adjuvant","ZHWU","Median age","IQR","palliative indications","clinical pathway","contrast","guidance","outbreak","susceptible population","Treatment sites","date","Findings","edition criteria","abdomen","pelvis","Methods","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

This paper presents RNAVLab (RNA Virtual Laboratory), a virtual laboratory for studying RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots that allows scientists to address this challenge. Two important case studies show the versatility and functionalities of RNAVLab. The first study quantifies its capability to rebuild longer secondary structures from motifs found in systematically sampled nucleotide segments. The extensive sampling and predictions are made feasible in a short turnaround time because of the grid technology used.

To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate representation of real-time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid-19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence-based Bayesian parameter estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real-time dynamics of Covid-19 cases, and explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid-19 data from Albania, where drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics of reported cases 9-31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5-15 April, and be contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real-time, and inform adaptive intervention for success in other settings.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gjini, Erida","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb17399caf96a9bd111dfb9b0c13a66398c9d4e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of control measures","drastic control measures","Albanian data","real-time dynamics of Covid","transmission dynamics","dynamics of reported cases","quantitative effects of different control measures","social distancing measures","data match","Bayesian framework","active confirmed cases","accurate representation of real-time data","model predictions","epidemic","Albanian setting","transmission reduction","SEIR modeling framework","preliminary projections","evidence-based Bayesian parameter estimation","forecasting","tool","adaptive intervention","travel restrictions","mathematical models","context","countries","place","biggest challenges healthcare systems","strong signature","success","settings","day","peak","future course","fatalities","support","weeks","parameters","SARS-CoV","outbreak","trend"],"language":"en"},

Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga\u00AE, (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods We conducted a statewide population-level survey in Vermont from March 29-April 12, 2020, during the beginning of a statewide stay-at-home order. We utilized the USDA six-item validated food security module to measure food insecurity before COVID-19 and since COVID-19. We assessed food insecurity prevalence and reported food access challenges, coping strategies, and perceived helpful interventions among food secure, consistently food insecure (pre-and post COVID-19), and newly food insecure (post COVID-19) respondents. Results Among 3,219 respondents, there was a 33% increase in household food insecurity since COVID-19 (p\u003C0.001), with 35.6% of food insecure households classified as newly food insecure. Respondents experiencing a job loss were more likely to experience food insecurity (OR 3.43; 95% CI, 2.45-4.80). Multiple physical and economic barriers, as well as concerns related to food access during COVID-19, are reported, with respondents experiencing household food insecurity more likely to face access challenges (p\u003C0.001). Significant differences in coping strategies were documented between respondents in newly food insecure vs. consistently insecure households. Conclusions Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in food insecurity in Vermont, accompanied by major food access barriers. These findings have important potential impacts on individual health, including mental health and malnutrition, as well as on future healthcare costs.

To further promote the implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution based on a synchronized encouragement/enforcement of mask utilization by the public based on widely available textiles (mask fabrication without the need for sewing machines), here we conducted a study using germ-free mice to determine to what extent textiles were effective in vivo. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which 100% cotton textile prevented the contamination of germ-free animals on the other side of the textile-barrier (simulating a properly worn mask). Of relevance, all mice protected with textiles remained germ-free after two sprays (inoculation dose: \u003E600 bacterial droplet units per 56.75cm2) compared to the contamination of mice not protected by a textile (0/12 vs 6/6, Fisher\u2019s exact, p\u003C0.0001). In a second phase of the experiment with 12 germ-free mice exposed again to 10-fold more droplets remained germ-free, while 100% of mice at 180cm became colonized with a single spray (0/8 vs 4/4, Fisher exact, p=0.002). Collectively, barriers protected all mice (even with low-density textiles, heavy vs. light fabric, T-test, p=0.0028) when using textile-EDB to cover the cages (0/20 vs 10/10, Fisher exact, p\u003C0.0001).

Here we present a simple clinical workflow that uses a sensitive and highly specific colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and takes forty minutes from sample collection to result. This test requires no specialized equipment and costs a few dollars per sample. Nasopharyngeal samples collected in saline were added either directly (unprocessed) to RT-LAMP reactions or first inactivated by a combined chemical and heat treatment step to inhibit RNases and lyse virions and human cells. The specimens were then amplified with two SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets and an internal specimen control; the resulting color change was visually interpreted. While direct addition of unprocessed specimens to RT-LAMP reactions could reliably detect samples with abundant SARS-CoV-2, the assay sensitivity markedly increased after the addition of an inactivation step. In 62 clinical samples with a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid concentrations, the assay had 87.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a limit of detection at least 25 copies/L, making it an ideal test to rule in infection. To increase sensitivity, samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by direct sample addition could be reflexed to a purification step, to increase the effective per-reaction sample input volume. In 40 purified samples, the assay yielded a 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a limit of detection comparable to commercially available real-time PCR-based diagnostics that have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. This test for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed in a range of settings for a fraction of the price of other available tests, with limited equipment, and without relying on over-burdened supply chains to increase overall testing capacity.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anahtar, M.

By identifying and critically synthesizing 42 recent peer-reviewed studies employing capsid integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its derivates between 10 and 200 uM; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 to 25C) for 5 to 120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 to 800 Watts) exposure for periods ranging from 5 to 20 min. These simple steps can benefit the investigation of infectious virus transmission in routine (water) monitoring settings and during viral outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 pandemic or endemic diseases like dengue fever.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leifels, M.; Dan, C.; Sozzi, E.; Shoults, D.

Early evidence shows that the exponential spread of COVID-19 can be slowed by restrictive isolation measures, but these place a tremendous burden on society. Moreover, once these restrictions are lifted, the exponential spread is likely to re-emerge. It has been suggested that population-scale testing can help break the cycle of isolation and spread, but current detection methods are not capable of such large-scale processing. Here we propose LAMP-Seq, a barcoded Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) protocol that could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of population-scale testing. In this approach, individual samples are processed in a single heat step, producing barcoded amplicons that can be shipped to a sequencing center, pooled, and analyzed en masse. Using unique barcode combinations per sample from a compressed barcode space enables extensive pooling, significantly reducing cost and organizational efforts. Given the low cost and scalability of next-generation sequencing, we believe that this method can be affordably scaled to analyze millions of samples per day using existing sequencing infrastructure.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmid-Burgk, Jonathan L.; Li, David; Feldman, David; S\u0142abicki, Miko\u0142aj; Borrajo, Jacob; Strecker, Jonathan; Cleary, Brian; Regev, Aviv; Zhang, Feng","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2ee6793aeaf24226cbc6f7a1801a19955c82b97.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.025635","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exponential spread of COVID","low cost","population-scale testing","generation sequencing","sequencing center","existing sequencing infrastructure","barcoded amplicons","RT-LAMP","individual samples","millions of samples","LAMP-Seq","complexity of population","cycle of isolation","ongoing COVID","compressed barcode space","unique barcode combinations","restrictive isolation measures","barcoded Reverse-Transcription Loop","Isothermal Amplification","extensive pooling","single heat step","day","current detection methods","pandemic","protocol","scalability","Early evidence","tremendous burden","large-scale processing","organizational efforts","society","devastating losses","approach","restrictions"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, the RNA extraction step is both laborious and expensive, thus hampering the diagnosis in many places where there are not laboratory staff of funds enough to contribute for diagnosis efforts. Thus, the need to simplify procedures, reduce costs of the techniques used, and expand the capacity of the number of diagnostics of COVID-19 is imperative.

This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. Methods: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. Results: 33869 treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. 592 patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results were available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. Conclusion: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture. The result was a reliance on use under compassionate circumstances, resulting in continued uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and harms of anti-viral treatment.

In this study, therefore, we used a global dataset of COVID-19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID-19 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial analysis. We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; however, the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity rather than temperature. In particular, a lower growth rate was observed for a higher precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity. These effects were independent of population density, human life quality, and travel restrictions. The results indicate that the temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics, which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions. However, the contributions of the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather, the contribution of travel restrictions in each country was more significant.

Methods: We developed recurrent neural network (RNN) for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics and Counterfactual-RNN (CRNN) for evaluating and exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide. We applied the developed methods to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world. The data were collected from January 22 to April 18, 2020 by John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/MAP.HTML). Results: The average errors of 1-step to 10-step forecasting were 2.9%. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we evaluated the potential effects of a number of public health measures. We found that the estimated peak number of new cases and cumulative cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases worldwide with one week later additional intervention were reduced to 103,872, 2,104,800, and 2,271,648, respectively. The estimated total peak number of new cases and cumulative cases would be the same as the above and the maximum number of cumulative cases would be 3,864,872 in the world with 3 week later additional intervention.

However, we observed that transmission would quickly rebound if interventions were relaxed. Conclusions: The accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was high. The AI and causal inference-inspired methods are a powerful tool for helping public health planning and policymaking.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: The population-based UK Biobank study was linked to English covid-19 test results. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals resident in England and alive in 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases (n=605) were defined by a positive covid-19 test result conducted between 16th March and 16th April 2020, during a restricted testing policy for hospitalised individuals with severe disease. RESULTS: A total of 406,793 participants were included. Mean age on 1st January 2020 was 68 years (range 48 to 85 years). 55% were women. In multivariable models, major independent risk factors for hospitalisation with covid-19 were male sex (odds ratio 1.52; 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 1.81; P\u003C0.001), South Asian ethnicity (2.02; 1.28 to 3.17; P=0.002) or black ethnicity (3.09; 2.18 to 4.38; P\u003C0.001) compared to white ethnicity, greater residential deprivation (1.92 for most deprived quartile compared to least deprived quartile; 1.50 to 2.47; P\u003C0.001), higher BMI (2.04 for BMI \u003E35 compared to \u003C25 Kg/m2; 1.50 to 2.77; P\u003C0.001), former smoking (1.39 compared to never smoked; 1.16 to 1.66; P\u003C0.001), and comorbidities hypertension (1.28; 1.06 to 1.53; P=0.009) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.81; 1.34 to 2.44; P\u003C0.001). Increased risk was observed with increasing number of antihypertensive medications used rather than any individual class.

A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis - for example, A3G deaminates the third cytidine in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy, which we have used to capture an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We characterized an A3G-DNA binding pocket that is important for the enzyme to scan the DNA for its hotspot. The results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.","publish_time":"2017-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ziegler, Samantha J.; Liu, Chang; Landau, Mark; Buzovetsky, Olga; Desimmie, Belete A.; Zhao, Qi; Sasaki, Tomoaki; Burdick, Ryan C.; Pathak, Vinay K.; Anderson, Karen S.; Xiong, Yong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/235481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A3G deaminates","A3G-ssDNA interaction","A3G-DNA binding pocket","novel DNA","A3G antiviral activity","specific DNA sequences","A3 proteins act","loss of DNA affinity","mechanism of DNA substrate selection","single-stranded DNA","viral ssDNA","full-length protein","conversion of cytidine","family of cytidine deaminases","well-studied human A3 family members","specific substrate sequence","truncated protein","viral infection","enzyme-catalytic polypeptide","CCCA sequence motif","potent inhibitor of HIV","Human apolipoprotein B mRNA","innate immune response","catalysis","example","preferred substrates","poor solution behavior","uridine","help","better understanding","fusion strategy","insights","knowledge","results","hotspot"],"language":"en"},

Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate varies temporally (as the epidemic progresses) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries. Methods We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country. Findings We first showed that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found no evidence for association between comorbidities and case fatality rate at the country level. Case fatality rate was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1,000 inhabitants. We also report evidence suggesting an association between case fatality rate and the political regime, with democracies suffering from the highest mortality burden, compared to autocratic regimes. However, most of the among-country variance in case fatality rate remained unexplained. Interpretation Overall, these results emphasize the role of socio-economic and political factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the country level.

Although the systemic ischemic and inflammatory responses caused by COVID-19 can detrimentally affect cardiac function, the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human cardiomyocytes is not well-understood. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a model system to examine the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte-specific infection by SARS-CoV-2. Microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can enter and replicate within hiPSC-CMs, localizing at perinuclear locations within the cytoplasm. Viral cytopathic effect induced hiPSC-CM apoptosis and cessation of beating after 72 hours of infection. These studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect hiPSC-CMs in vitro, establishing a model for elucidating the mechanisms of infection and potentially a cardiac-specific antiviral drug screening platform.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Arun; Garcia, Gustavo; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Svendsen, Clive N.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e77b67dc0c0525595475b02f214163c5d76bf7f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.051912","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","hiPSC-CMs","specific infection","mechanisms of infection","COVID","hours of infection","direct impact of SARS","Viral cytopathic effect induced hiPSC","cardiac complications","human cardiomyocytes","cardiac function","viral myocarditis","viral pandemic","cardiac-specific antiviral drug screening platform","respiratory symptoms","mechanisms of cardiomyocyte","model system","Coronavirus disease","human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","heart failure","arrhythmias","apoptosis","inflammatory responses","cessation","perinuclear locations","immunofluorescence","cytoplasm","Microscopy","studies"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (\u226510 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR \u003E~5 in \u003E60-65 vs. \u003C50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR=1.73, [95%CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. For the other three factors, meta-regression analyses suggested confounding by age. Only four studies reported multivariable analysis, but most of them showed adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the potential for confounding, these results suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are independently associated with severe COVID-19 and, together with age and male sex, can be used to inform objective decisions on COVID-19 testing, clinical management, and workforce planning.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsushita, Kunihiro; Ding, Ning; Kou, Minghao; Hu, Xiao; Chen, Mengkun; Gao, Yumin; Honda, Yasuyuki; Dowdy, David; Mok, Yejin; Ishigami, Junichi; Appel, Lawrence J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/916b4931ea667224bdd1354b6f5801a4516056b3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk factors of severe COVID","cases of severe COVID","RR of age","severe cases","eligible studies","traditional risk factors","pooled RR","severe coronavirus disease","male sex","independent of age","adjusted RR","Older age","systematic review of studies","relative risk","pre-existing CVD","hypertension","diabetes","potential confounding","meta-regression analyses","papers","univariate analyses","Results","cardiovascular disease","mechanical ventilation","acute respiratory distress syndrome","testing","renin-angiotensin system inhibitors","estimates","intensive care unit admission","English","clinical management","death","original data","study","Embase","workforce planning","inclusion criteria","random-effects models","search","PubMed","objective decisions","Background","covariate","patients","change","Methods","publications","Conclusions","multivariable analysis","years"],"language":"en"},

The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world\u0027s highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80\u002B year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group.

Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. Conclusions: In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5oC, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease.

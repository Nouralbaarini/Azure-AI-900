Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e. initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g. changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g. costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g. epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neill, P.

Electron microscopy (EM) overcomes some problems associated with particle variability and has been an important tool for investigating coronavirus ultrastructure. However, EM sample preparation requires that the specimen be dried onto a carbon support film before imaging, collapsing internal particle structure in the case of coronaviruses. Moreover, conventional EM achieves image contrast by immersing the specimen briefly in heavy-metal-containing stain, which reveals some features while obscuring others. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) instead employs a porous support film, to which the specimen is adsorbed and flash-frozen. Specimens preserved in vitreous ice over holes in the support film can then be imaged without additional staining. Cryo-EM, coupled with single-particle image analysis techniques, makes it possible to examine the size, structure and arrangement of coronavirus structural components in fully hydrated, native virions. Two virus purification procedures are described.","publish_time":"2007-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neuman, Benjamin W.; Adair, Brian D.; Yeager, Mark; Buchmeier, Michael J.","journal":"SARS- and Other Coronaviruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b334f5efb0a88cf1a070e0a42c84fbabe0490fd3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121280.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19057879/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-181-9_12","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cryo-EM","conventional EM","carbon support film","porous support film","EM sample preparation","internal particle structure","particle variability","size","coronavirus ultrastructure","arrangement of coronavirus structural components","enveloped coronavirus particles","single-particle image analysis techniques","image contrast","Electron microscopy","Electron cryomicroscopy","traditional structural means","imaging","holes","important tool","vitreous ice","X-ray crystallography","study","problems","native virions","case of coronaviruses","Specimens","contour","heavy-metal","virus purification procedures","features","flash-frozen","additional staining"],"language":"en"},

Ten candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome datasets of B. cusia in this study, and the expression stability was assessed across 60 samples representing different tissues and organs under various conditions, including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, hormonal stimuli (jasmonic acid methyl ester and abscisic acid), and in different plant organs. By employing different algorithms, such as geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, which are complementary approaches based on different statistical procedures, 18S rRNA was found to be the most stable gene under UV irradiation and hormonal stimuli, whereas ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 was the best suitable gene for different plant organs.

Extensive metagenomic studies of material from bats, in particular guano, have revealed a large number of novel or divergent viral taxa that were previously unknown. New Zealand has only two extant indigenous terrestrial mammals, which are both bats, Mystacina tuberculata (the lesser short-tailed bat) and Chalinolobus tuberculatus (the long-tailed bat). Until the human introduction of exotic mammals, these species had been isolated from all other terrestrial mammals for over 1 million years (potentially over 16 million years for M. tuberculata). Four bat guano samples were collected from M. tuberculata roosts on the isolated offshore island of Whenua hou (Codfish Island) in New Zealand. Metagenomic analysis revealed that this species still hosts a plethora of divergent viruses. Whilst the majority of viruses detected were likely to be of dietary origin, some putative vertebrate virus sequences were identified. Papillomavirus, polyomavirus, calicivirus and hepevirus were found in the metagenomic data and subsequently confirmed using independent PCR assays and sequencing. The new hepevirus and calicivirus sequences may represent new genera within these viral families.

Although extensive work has been carried out with them, including their classification into six distinct phylogenetically clades, little is known on bacterial macrodomains, especially if these latter are able to remove poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) from PARylated proteins, activity that only has been confirmed in human TARG1 (C6orf130) protein. To extend this limited knowledge, we demonstrate, after a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis, that Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 (FmTARG1) is the first bacterial macrodomain shown to have high catalytic efficiency towards O-acyl-ADP-ribose, even more than hTARG1, and towards mono- and poly(ADPribosyl)ated proteins.

Previous studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human enterovirus infections may be associated with virus-induced asthma. For example, it has been suggested that HRV infection is detected in the acute exacerbation of asthma and infection is prolonged. Thus it is believed that the main etiological cause of asthma is ARI viruses. Furthermore, the number of asthma patients in most industrial countries has greatly increased, resulting in a morbidity rate of around 10-15% of the population. However, the relationships between viral infections, host immune response, and host factors in the pathophysiology of asthma remain unclear. To gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of virus-induced asthma, it is important to assess both the characteristics of the viruses and the host defense mechanisms. Molecular epidemiology enables us to understand the pathogenesis of microorganisms by identifying specific pathways, molecules, and genes that influence the risk of developing a disease. However, the epidemiology of various respiratory viruses associated with virus-induced asthma is not fully understood. Therefore, in this article, we review molecular epidemiological studies of RSV, HRV, HPIV, and HMPV infection associated with virus-induced asthma.","publish_time":"2013-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsukagoshi, Hiroyuki; Ishioka, Taisei; Noda, Masahiro; Kozawa, Kunihisa; Kimura, Hirokazu","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/794b9541d676d262ebca65c8b3f1d7ca64d4441f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3771312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24062735/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-induced asthma","epidemiology of virus","pathophysiology of asthma","human parainfluenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","acute exacerbation of asthma","HRV infection","number of asthma patients","main etiological cause of asthma","epidemiology of various respiratory viruses","HMPV infection","ARI viruses","various viruses","common cause of upper respiratory infection","human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","Molecular epidemiology","human enterovirus infections","Acute respiratory illness","host factors","HPIV","major cause of morbidity","molecular epidemiological studies of RSV","host immune response","host defense mechanisms","viral infections","Previous studies","morbidity rate","humans","specific pathways","molecules","pathogenesis of microorganisms","diseases","mortality","relationships","industrial countries","article","characteristics","better understanding","risk","bronchiolitis","pneumonia","example","population"],"language":"en"},

(Geraniaceae), a popular medicinal plant used in traditional medicine in the treatment of gastrointestinal ailments has been transformed into a phytopharmaceutical (EPs\u00AE 7360) for treating respiratory tract infections. The increasing international demand for Pelargonium sidoides has led to localised overexploitation of its wild populations in southern Africa. The aim of the review is to provide a synthesis of the current state of scientific knowledge on the phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological properties of Pelargonium sidoides as well as the potential role of plant biotechnology in its conservation. The review highlights knowledge gaps in these research areas. Materials and Methods A comprehensive literature search involving mainly electronic and library sources of information were used to collate and synthesise published data. Results Experimental results from in vitro studies indicate that bioactive phytochemical constituents of Pelargonium sidoides may not possess a direct antimicrobial effect, but instead act by interfering with microbial binding to host cell receptors, inhibition of key enzymes and the production of antimicrobial effector molecules such as nitric oxide and interferons (IFNs) by the host cells. Furthermore, clinical evaluations in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effect of Pelargonium sidoides in the treatment of respiratory tract infections with few side effects. However, there is lack of adequate information on the safety evaluation of the plant. On the other hand, the increasing demand for Pelargonium sidoides has led to localised illegal harvesting of wild plants. Conclusions Pharmacological data reported in literature suggest that Pelargonium sidoides shows a beneficial effect in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. However, more studies are required to elucidate the mode of action of the active constituents exhibited in the treatment of respiratory tract infections and other health conditions caused by microbial attack. Furthermore, the pharmacological usefulness of Pelargonium sidoides must take cognisance of the broader context involving the need for conservation-friendly approaches in its utilisation. In this regard, plant biotechnology applications can play a meaningful role in a holistic conservation strategy.","publish_time":"2014-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moyo, Mack; Van Staden, Johannes","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba9198e8a5754035e0ccdaa483c972f37cb26aad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127097.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874114000373; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114000373; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.01.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pelargonium"],"locations":["southern Africa"],"keyphrases":["beneficial effect of Pelargonium sidoides","pharmacological usefulness of Pelargonium sidoides","toxicological properties of Pelargonium sidoides","bioactive phytochemical constituents of Pelargonium sidoides","treatment of respiratory tract infections","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Pelargonium sidoides DC","plant biotechnology applications","potential role of plant biotechnology","treatment of gastrointestinal ailments","direct antimicrobial effect","popular medicinal plant","increasing demand","Conclusions Pharmacological data","studies","conservation-friendly approaches","holistic conservation strategy","increasing international demand","meaningful role","localised overexploitation","wild populations","active constituents","review highlights knowledge gaps","microbial binding","host cells","microbial attack","adequate information","published data","Experimental results","localised illegal harvesting of wild plants","host cell receptors","comprehensive literature search","library sources of information","production of antimicrobial effector molecules","current state of scientific knowledge","inhibition of key enzymes","traditional medicine","nitric oxide","health conditions","placebo-controlled trials","IFNs","interferons","need","cognisance","research areas","broader context","synthesis","Materials","Methods","safety evaluation","clinical evaluations","southern Africa","mode of action","utilisation","Geraniaceae","regard","hand","effects","phytopharmaceutical","EPs","aim"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, two sulfate ions and one diphosphate coordinated with some conserved residues were observed in the active cleft, which affords a better understanding of a possible mode of substrate binding.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ge, Honghua; Chen, Xiaofang; Yang, Weili; Niu, Liwen; Teng, Maikun","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/226281a14c21ff171c587267dac389fb94ab0813.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092880.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.01.095; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X1300185X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23384440/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X1300185X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Ap4A hydrolase","E58A mutant human Ap4A hydrolase","asymmetrical diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase","type","canonical Nudix fold","crystal structure of wild","better understanding","common \u03B1\u03B2\u03B1-sandwich architecture","possible mode of substrate binding","diphosphate","active cleft","conserved residues","bound adenosine moiety","enzyme","paper","number of biological processes","sulfate ions","polyphosphate chain"],"language":"en"},

With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People\u2019s Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18\u201386 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1\u20136 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3\u20134 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient\u2019s history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xi; Yu, Chengcheng; Qu, Jing; Zhang, Lieguang; Jiang, Songfeng; Huang, Deyang; Chen, Bihua; Zhang, Zhiping; Guan, Wanhua; Ling, Zhoukun; Jiang, Rui; Hu, Tianli; Ding, Yan; Lin, Lin; Gan, Qingxin; Luo, Liangping; Tang, Xiaoping; Liu, Jinxin","journal":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/272c530d8b3a2daae3af01fa4a59b350f3a5398b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080117.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32107577/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Guangzhou Eighth People\u2019s Hospital"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["included patients","majority of infected patients","included SARS-CoV","Chest CT examination","baseline chest CT","distribution characteristics","imaging characteristics","clinical characteristics","follow-up chest CT images","bilateral ground glass opacities","typical chest CT imaging features","COVID","days","novel coronavirus pneumonia","Multiple patchy ground glass opacities","clinical manifestations","linear opacities","periphery distribution","peripheral distribution","infection","years","Guangzhou","Wuhan","addition","regions of China","accompanying manifestations of lung lesions","non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography","multifocal lung lesions","median age","history of exposure","pericardial effusion","age range","patient\u2019s history","Pleural effusion","designated hospital","People\u2019s Hospital","laboratory tests","uncommon findings","interlobular thickening","crazy paving pattern","initial diagnosis","important role","morphology","real-time polymerase chain reaction","lymphadenopathy","women","PCR","spread","disease","similar cases","fever","abnormalities","radiological evolution","analysis","METHODS","CONCLUSION","half","adjacent pleura","cough","nCoV","BACKGROUND","lobes","consolidation"],"language":"en"},

Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. METHOD: : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health \u2013 these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet.

Pig is used both for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and human diseases, sheep is a model for corneal transplantation, and the horse naturally develops arthritis. Non-human primate models (macaque, common marmoset, owl monkey) are used for preclinical gene vector safety and efficacy trials to bridge the gap prior to clinical studies. We aim for the safe development of clinically effective delivery systems for DNA and RNAi technologies.","publish_time":"2008-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blagbrough, Ian S.; Zara, Chiara","journal":"Pharm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a269fa8dda9cf98a04b57d5762195e83e618a8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088656.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18841450/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-008-9646-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Larger animal models","different models","studies of efficacy","clinical studies","Non-human primate models","effective delivery systems","siRNA delivery","relevant animal model","successful delivery system","efficacy trials","human diseases","impact of gene","clinical reality","targeted drug carrier systems","preclinical gene vector safety","macaque","current search","sheep","common marmoset","polyplexes","zebrafish","cat","owl monkey","mouth disease","rodent","fecine","liposomes","recent literature","cricetine","madake","DNA","rabbit","pharmacodynamics","RNAi technologies","wide variety of","lipoplexes","setting","corneal transplantation","pharmacokinetics","polynucleic acids","dog","cell lines","safe development","gap","horse","lipopolyamines","prevention of foot"],"language":"en"},

Presently, several classes of antimalarial drugs are available in market, but the issues of toxicity, lower efficacy and the resistance by malarial parasites have decreased their overall therapeutic indices. Thus, the search for new promising antimalarials continues, however, the battle against malaria is far from over. Ferroquine is a derivative of chloroquine with antimalarial properties. It is the most successful of the chloroquine derivatives. Not only ferroquine, but also its derivatives have shown promising potential as antimalarials of clinical interest. Presently, much research is dedicated to the development of ferroquine derivatives as safe alternatives to antimalarial chemotherapy. The present article describes the structural, chemical and biological features of ferroquine. Several classes of ferroquine derivatives including hydroxyferroquines, trioxaferroquines, chloroquine-bridged ferrocenophanes, thiosemicarbazone derivatives, ferrocene dual conjugates, 4-N-substituted derivatives, and others have been discussed. Besides, the mechanism of action of ferroquine has been discussed. A careful observation has been made into pharmacologically significant ferroquine derivatives with better or equal therapeutic effects to that of chloroquine and ferroquine. A brief discussion of the toxicities of ferroquine derivatives has been made. Finally, efforts have been made to discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of ferroquine-based antimalarial drug development.","publish_time":"2015-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wani, Waseem A.; Jameel, Ehtesham; Baig, Umair; Mumtazuddin, Syed; Hun, Lee Ting","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af16fa6c03865d647ce0d228e4a0d03b2f1331eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115395.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26188909/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523415301410; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.07.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523415301410","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of ferroquine derivatives","classes of ferroquine derivatives","significant ferroquine derivatives","toxicities of ferroquine derivatives","chloroquine derivatives","thiosemicarbazone derivatives","future perspectives of ferroquine","biological features of ferroquine","N-substituted derivatives","antimalarial chemotherapy","derivative of chloroquine","antimalarial properties","antimalarial drug development","classes of antimalarial drugs","chloroquine-bridged ferrocenophanes","new promising antimalarials","antimalarials of clinical","promising potential","Abstract Malaria","equal therapeutic effects","overall therapeutic indices","ferrocene dual conjugates","malarial parasites","trioxaferroquines","safe alternatives","hydroxyferroquines","lower efficacy","issues of toxicity","resistance","human populations","market","current challenges","brief discussion","long time","present article","battle","mechanism of action","careful observation","research","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Previous work on the infection of tissue culture cell lines with the betacoronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) showed that they generate double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes as part of a reticular membrane network. Here we describe a detailed study of the membrane rearrangements induced by the avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in a mammalian cell line but also in primary avian cells and in epithelial cells of ex vivo tracheal organ cultures. In all cell types, structures novel to IBV infection were identified that we have termed zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and spherules. Zippered ER lacked luminal space, suggesting zippering of ER cisternae, while spherules appeared as uniform invaginations of zippered ER. Electron tomography showed that IBV-induced spherules are tethered to the zippered ER and that there is a channel connecting the interior of the spherule with the cytoplasm, a feature thought to be necessary for sites of RNA synthesis but not seen previously for membrane rearrangements induced by coronaviruses. We also identified DMVs in IBV-infected cells that were observed as single individual DMVs or were connected to the ER via their outer membrane but not to the zippered ER. Interestingly, IBV-induced spherules strongly resemble confirmed sites of RNA synthesis for alphaviruses, nodaviruses, and bromoviruses, which may indicate similar strategies of IBV and these diverse viruses for the assembly of RNA replication complexes. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses induce rearranged cellular membranes, providing a platform for viral replication complex assembly and protecting viral RNA from cellular defenses. We have studied the membrane rearrangements induced by an important poultry pathogen, the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Previous work studying closely related betacoronaviruses identified double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in infected cells. However, the role of DMVs and CMs in viral RNA synthesis remains unclear because these sealed vesicles lack a means of delivering viral RNA to the cytoplasm. Here, we characterized structures novel to IBV infection: zippered ER and small vesicles tethered to the zippered ER termed spherules. Significantly, spherules contain a channel connecting their interior to the cytoplasm and strongly resemble confirmed sites of RNA synthesis for other positive-sense RNA viruses, making them ideal candidates for the site of IBV RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2013-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maier, Helena J.; Hawes, Philippa C.; Cottam, Eleanor M.; Mantell, Judith; Verkade, Paul; Monaghan, Paul; Wileman, Tom; Britton, Paul","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dad67bd586092707fb9e7d311d465b82b85425f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3812713.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00801-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24149513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Zippered ER","RNA","IBV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA synthesis","IBV-induced spherules","site of IBV RNA synthesis","zippered ER termed spherules","IBV infection","positive-sense RNA viruses","confirmed sites of RNA synthesis","IBV-infected cells","membrane rearrangements","uniform invaginations of zippered ER","double-membrane vesicles","assembly of RNA replication complexes","positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses","zippering of ER cisternae","outer membrane","similar strategies of IBV","zippered endoplasmic reticulum","Replication of positive","convoluted membranes","role of DMVs","reticular membrane network","cytoplasm","rearranged cellular membranes","single individual DMVs","rearrangement of cellular membranes","small vesicles","diverse viruses","sealed vesicles","viral replication complex assembly","primary avian cells","avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","epithelial cells of ex","CMs","cell types","structures novel","cellular defenses","Previous work","interior","channel","infection of tissue culture cell lines","betacoronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus","mammalian cell line","related betacoronaviruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","platform","important poultry pathogen","alphaviruses","ideal candidates","SARS-CoV","luminal space","tracheal organ cultures","feature thought","bromoviruses","nodaviruses","means","Electron tomography","detailed study","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

Currently available prophylactic vaccines are type specific and have less therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, we aimed to predict the potential species-specific and therapeutic epitopes from the protein sequences of HPV45 by using different immunoinformatics tools. METHODS: Initially, we determined the antigenic potential of late (L1 and L2) and early (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) proteins. Then, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8(\u002B) T-cell epitopes were selected based on their immunogenicity. In addition, epitope conservancy, population coverage (PC), and target receptor-binding affinity of the immunogenic epitopes were determined. Moreover, we predicted the possible CD8(\u002B), nested interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3)-producing CD4(\u002B), and linear B-cell epitopes. Further, antigenicity, allergenicity, immunogenicity, and system biology-based virtual pathway associated with cervical cancer were predicted to confirm the therapeutic efficiency of overlapped epitopes. RESULTS: Twenty-seven immunogenic epitopes were found to exhibit cross-protection (\u226555%) against the 15 high-risk HPV strains (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 69, 73, and 82). The highest PC was observed in Europe (96.30%), North America (93.98%), West Indies (90.34%), North Africa (90.14%), and East Asia (89.47%). Binding affinities of 79 docked complexes observed as global energy ranged from \u221210.80 to \u221286.71 kcal/mol. In addition, CD8(\u002B) epitope-overlapped segments in CD4(\u002B) and B-cell epitopes demonstrated that immunogenicity and IFN-\u03B3-producing efficiency ranged from 0.0483 to 0.5941 and 0.046 to 18, respectively. Further, time core simulation revealed the overlapped epitopes involved in pRb, p53, COX-2, NF-X1, and HPV45 infection signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Even though the results of this study need to be confirmed by further experimental peptide sensitization studies, the findings on immunogenic and IFN-\u03B3-producing CD8(\u002B) and overlapped epitopes provide new insights into HPV vaccine development.","publish_time":"2018-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaliamurthi, Satyavani; Selvaraj, Gurudeeban; Kaushik, Aman Chandra; Gu, Ke-Ren; Wei, Dong-Qing","journal":"Biologics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4aa64b68fec8e053f6abcc1594eee14507853618.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6174296.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/btt.s177901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30323556/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","North America","North Africa","East Asia"],"keyphrases":["immunogenic epitopes","therapeutic epitopes","therapeutic efficiency of overlapped epitopes","T-cell epitopes","linear B-cell epitopes","IFN-\u03B3","immunogenicity","restricted CD8","possible CD8","epitope-overlapped segments","addition","CD4","RESULTS","HPV vaccine development","high-risk HPV strains","cases of cervical cancer","epitope conservancy","HPV45 infection","Binding affinities","highest PC","North America","North Africa","protein sequences of HPV45","antigenic potential of late","target receptor-binding affinity","findings","new insights","population coverage","E6","E5","docked complexes","NF-X1","system biology","virtual pathway","nested interferon gamma","p53","major histocompatibility complex class","experimental peptide sensitization studies","Human papillomavirus","E1","E2","E4","COX","L1","L2","different immunoinformatics tools","AIM","allergenicity","pRb","time core simulation","available prophylactic vaccines","E7","global energy","BACKGROUND","pathways","Europe","world","oncogenic agent","proteins","West Indies","antigenicity","cross-protection","kcal","East Asia","CONCLUSION","study","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Both siRNAs knockdown or silenced the target RABV genes as evaluated in a plasmid based transient expression model. For efficient delivery, adenoviruses expressing the siRNAs were constructed and antiviral potential of the delivered siRNAs was investigated in BHK-21 cells. When cells treated with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged with RABV, there was 88.35\u00B12.4% and 41.52\u00B19.3% reduction in RABV multiplication in infected cells with siRNAs targeting RABV-N and L genes, respectively. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR revealed knockdown of both RABV-N and L gene transcripts, however, significant reduction was observed only with adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N. When mice treated intracerebrally with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged peripherally with lethal RABV by the intramuscular route in masseter muscle, there was 66.6% and 33.3% protection with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs against RABV-N and L genes, respectively. These results demonstrated that adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N efficiently inhibited the RABV multiplication both, in vitro and in vivo and conferred significant protection against lethal RABV challenge. This supported the hypothesis that RNAi, based on siRNA targeting RABV-N gene can prevent RABV infection and holds the potential of RNAi as an approach to prevent rabies infection.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Praveen K.; Sonwane, Arvind A.; Singh, Niraj K.; Meshram, Chetan D.; Dahiya, Shyam S.; Pawar, Sachin S.; Gupta, Swatantra P.; Chaturvedi, V.

Since pig small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are target cells of PEDV infection, IEC cells were utilized as a model for studying changes in cellular activities post-PEDV infection. Monitoring of Na(\u002B)-K(\u002B)-ATPase and Ca(2\u002B)-Mg(2\u002B)-ATPase activities demonstrated that PEDV infection decreased these activities. In addition, IECs proliferation was shown to decrease after PEDV infection using an MTT assay. Moreover, IECs apoptosis detected by flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI) staining was clearly shown to increase relative to the control group. Meanwhile, animal experiments indicated that PEDV virulence for IEC cells was greater than viral virulence for Vero cells, although this may be due to viral attenuation after numerous passages in the latter cell line.

COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations had concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. Exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. In a further prospective analysis of 504 exacerbations, where daily monitoring was performed, there was some deterioration in symptoms, though no there were significant peak expiratory flow changes. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnoea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. The changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations. The reasons for the incomplete recovery of symptoms and lung function are not clear, but may involve inadequate treatment or persistence of the causative agent. The incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. The association of the symptoms of increased dyspnoea and of the common cold at exacerbation with a prolonged recovery suggests that viral infections may lead to more prolonged exacerbations.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wedzicha, Jadwiga A.","journal":"Asthma and COPD","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffba5b8973e172b263428504d466156877eca422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157929.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123740014000675; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123740014000675","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prolonged exacerbations","mechanisms of exacerbations","asthmatic exacerbations","Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations","increasing severity of COPD","Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations","incomplete recovery of symptoms","lung function","prolonged recovery","Exacerbation frequency","symptoms of increased dyspnoea","incomplete physiological recovery","important cause","presence of increased dyspnoea","important outcome measures","studies of hospital admission","daily cough","important determinant of health status","considerable morbidity","daily monitoring","significant peak expiratory flow changes","sputum","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","causes","time","inadequate treatment","viral infections","persistence","mortality","decline","patients","community","causative agent","previous year","Publisher Summary","association","reasons","prospective analysis","deterioration"],"language":"en"},

These infections occur mainly in the first month after transplantation and are hospital-acquired. Nosocomial infections cause significant morbidity and are the most common cause of mortality in this early period of transplantation. These infections are caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms, mainly Gram-negative enterobacteria, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and staphylococci. The patients at risk of developing nosocomial bacterial infections are those previously colonized with MDR bacteria while on the transplant waiting list. Intravascular catheters, the urinary tract, the lungs, and surgical wounds are the most frequent sources of infection. Preventive measures are the same as those applied in non-immunocompromised, hospitalized patients except in patients at high risk for developing fungal infection. These patients need antifungal therapy during their hospitalization, and for preventing some bacterial infections in the early transplant period, patients need vaccinations on the waiting list according to the current recommendations. Although morbidity and mortality related to infectious diseases have decreased during the last few years in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, they are still one of the most important complications in this population. Furthermore, as occurs in the general population, the incidence of nosocomial infections has increased during the different phases of transplantation. It is difficult to establish general preventive measures in these patients, as there are many risk factors conditioning these infections. Firstly, they undergo multiple antibiotic treatments and interventions; secondly, there is a wide variability in the degree of neutropenia and immunosuppression among patients, and finally they combine hospital and home stay during the transplant process. However, some simple measures could be implemented to improve the current situation.","publish_time":"2014-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno Camacho, Asunci\u00F3n; Ruiz Camps, Isabel","journal":"Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103322.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2014.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common infections","nosocomial bacterial infections","incidence of nosocomial infections","hospitalized patients","early transplant period","transplant process","early period of transplantation","general preventive measures","solid organ transplant recipients","haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","high risk","common cause of mortality","risk factors","general population","waiting list","simple measures","different phases of transplantation","Gram-negative enterobacteria","non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli","MDR bacteria","significant morbidity","fungal infection","current recommendations","current situation","frequent sources of infection","microorganisms","vaccinations","enterococci","degree of neutropenia","years","multi-drug resistant","urinary tract","surgical wounds","lungs","home stay","hospitalization","multiple antibiotic treatments","interventions","Intravascular catheters","wide variability","staphylococci","infectious diseases","antifungal therapy","immunosuppression","month","important complications"],"language":"en"},

People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children\u2019s Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 \u002B CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-\u03B3 (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Dan; Li, Hui; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Xiao, Han; Ren, Jie; Zhang, Fu-Rong; Liu, Zhi-Sheng","journal":"World J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43700d265cca721627fbbbc0aa163bf2cc349842.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091225.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32193831/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ill patients","series of severe pediatric patients","severe COVID","clinical features of severe pediatric patients","imaging data","laboratory findings","common symptoms","Common imaging changes","shadows","multiple patch","ICU","Chest imaging","ground-glass opacity","polypnea","information","increased CD3","SARS-CoV","fever","cough","Wuhan Children\u2019s Hospital","demographic data","clinical outcomes","increased C-reactive protein","Treatment modalities","treatments","procalcitonin","lactate dehydrogenase","CD56","ages","Intensive Care Unit","outbreak of coronavirus disease","blood counts","invasive mechanical ventilation","cytokine storm","BACKGROUND","CD4","decreased CD16","onset age","respiratory support","abnormal liver function","years","RESULTS","People","CD8","Hubei","China","infection","CONCLUSIONS","months","IFN-\u03B3","boys","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies demonstrated that SVV 3Cpro suppresses innate immune responses by cleavage of host proteins and degradation of IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression. Here, we showed that SVV 3C protease (3Cpro) has deubiquitinating activity. Overexpressed 3Cpro inhibits the ubiquitination of cellular substrates, acting on both lysine-48- and lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. SVV infection also possessed deubiquitinating activity. The ubiquitin-proteasome system was significantly involved in SVV replication. Furthermore, 3Cpro inhibited the ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), thereby blocking the expression of interferon (IFN)-\u03B2 and IFN stimulated gene 54 (ISG54) mRNAs. A detailed analysis revealed that mutations (H48A, C160A, or H48A/C160A) that ablate the Cys and His residues of 3Cpro abrogated its deubiquitinating activity and the ability of 3Cpro to block IFN-\u03B2 induction. Together, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism developed by SVV 3Cpro to promote viral replication, and may also provide a novel strategy for improving ubiquitination-based therapy.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xue, Qiao; Liu, Huisheng; Zhu, Zixiang; Yang, Fan; Xue, Qinghong; Cai, Xuepeng; Liu, Xiangtao; Zheng, Haixue","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/995d2bb3b94e40338961672f61cd66b6893763df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111287.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.10.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218304303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408499/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218304303","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SVV","TNF","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cpro","SVV replication","SVV infection","deubiquitinating activity","IFN stimulated gene","IFN-\u03B2 induction","H48A","lysine","C160A","innate immune responses","ubiquitination of cellular substrates","ubiquitination-based therapy","ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene","novel strategy","novel mechanism","expression of interferon","viral replication","cleavage of host proteins","IRF7 protein expression","degradation of IRF3","TBK1","TNF receptor-associated factor","TRAF3","RIG","mutations","Seneca Valley Virus","ISG54","ability","TANK-binding kinase","C protease","mechanisms","linked polyubiquitin chains","detailed analysis","mRNAs","ubiquitin-proteasome system","Cys","residues","Previous studies","results"],"language":"en"},

For most, there are no licensed vaccines available for human use, although there is ongoing research and development. However, given the extensive and increasing list of emerging pathogens and the investment required to bring vaccines into clinical use, the task is huge. Overlaid on this task is the risk of anti\u2010microbial resistance (AMR) acquisition by micro\u2010organisms which can endow a relatively harmless organism with pathogenic potential. Furthermore, climate change also introduces a challenge by causing some of the insect vectors and environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions to begin to spread out from these traditional areas, thus increasing the risk of migration of zoonotic disease. Vaccination provides a defence against these emerging pathogens. However, vaccines for pathogens which cause severe, but occasional, disease outbreaks in endemic pockets have suffered from a lack of commercial incentive for development to a clinical standard, encompassing Phase III clinical trials for efficacy. An alternative is to develop such vaccines to request US Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), or equivalent status in the United States, Canada and the European Union, making use of a considerable number of regulatory mechanisms that are available prior to licensing. This review covers the status of vaccine development for some of the emerging pathogens, the hurdles that need to be overcome to achieve EUA or an equivalent regional or national status and how these considerations may impact vaccine development for the future, such that a more comprehensive stockpile of promising vaccines can be achieved.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williamson, E.

Tanreqing injection (TRQ) is a commonly used herbal patent medicine for treating inflammatory airway diseases in view of its outstanding anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we explored the signaling pathways involved in contributions of TRQ to LPS-induced airway inflammation in rats. Methods/Design. Adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats randomly divided into different groups received intratracheal instillation of LPS and/or intraperitoneal injection of TRQ. Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected at 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h after TRQ administration. Protein and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) \u03B1, Interleukin- (IL-) 1\u03B2, IL-6, and IL-8 in BALF and lung homogenate were observed by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively. Lung sections were stained for p38 MAPK and NF-\u03BAB detection by immunohistochemistry. Phospho-p38 MAPK, phosphor-extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2, phospho-SAPK/JNK, phospho-NF-\u03BAB p65, phospho-IKK\u03B1/\u03B2, and phospho-I\u03BAB-\u03B1 were measured by western blot analysis. Results. The results showed that TRQ significantly counteracted LPS-stimulated release of TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and IL-8, attenuated cells influx in BALF, mitigated mucus hypersecretion, suppressed phosphorylation of NF-\u03BAB p65, I\u03BAB-\u03B1, \u0399KK\u03B1/\u03B2, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK, and inhibited p38 MAPK and NF-\u03BAB p65 expression in rat lungs. Conclusions.

The griffithsin product used in the clinic has been expressed and purified in N. benthamiana, using a TMV-based viral vector system, Geneware\u00AE. Outdoor pharming of biopharmaceuticals would further alleviate startup costs for biotechnology firms and may allow broader product accessibility.

In addition to using this hybrid line we expand on methods for in planta storage of griffithsin in leafy plants by ensiling kilogram quantities of griffithsin. The ensiling process allows year-round biomanufacturing, minimal environmental-controlled storage, and reduces the industry need for multiple growth areas to maintain multi-product manufacturing of plant-based pharmaceuticals. This study shows that griffithsin can be expressed in N. excelsiana and is stable, recoverable, and active from ensiled tissue.

ZIKV infects through epithelial barriers where IFN-\u03BB1 is an important antiviral molecule. In this study, we analyzed the effects of ZIKV proteins on the activation of IFN-\u03BB1 promoter. All ZIKV proteins were cloned and transiently expressed. ZIKV NS5, but no other ZIKV protein, was able to interfere with the RIG-I signaling pathway. This inhibition took place upstream of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) resulting in reduced phosphorylation of IRF3 and reduced activation of IFN-\u03BB1 promoter.

METHODS: We selected 30 patients with hormone-NOFH as case group, and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited as control group. miRCURYTM LNA miRNA chip and quantitative RT-PCR were used to examine differential miRNAs expression. Correlation assay was performed between miRNAs and NOFH trait. RESULTS: We found that 9 miRNAs were upregulated while 3 miRNAs were downregulated in hormone-TOFH patient serum by result of miRNA chip. QRT-PCR assay revealed that the level of miR-423-5p was significantly increased and miR-10a-5p was significantly decreased.

On the other hand, cysteine S-conjugate \u03B2-lyases occur in nature as a means of generating some biologically useful sulfhydryl-containing compounds.","publish_time":"2017-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, A.J.L.; Hanigan, M.H.","journal":"Comprehensive Toxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0b483c657d154f50104a0715252724bd0ffb5de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173497.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128012383019735; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383019735","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["corresponding glutathione S-conjugate","cysteine S-conjugate \u03B2-lyases","N-acetylcysteine S-conjugate","\u03B2-lyase reaction","mercapturate pathway components","endogenous compounds","useful sulfhydryl","toxic electrophilic xenobiotics","environmental contaminants","conversion","drugs","halogenated workplace","means","nature","hand","fragment","mechanism","toxicity","toxification","Bioactivation"],"language":"en"},

However, the implication of this protein complex in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) disease has not been fully studied. Herein, we report that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a detrimental role during HMPV infection because NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protected mice from mortality and reduced weight loss and inflammation without impacting viral replication. We also demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome exerts its deleterious effect via IL-1\u03B2 production since we observed reduced mortality, weight loss and inflammation in IL-1\u03B2-deficient (IL-1\u03B2(-/-)) mice, as compared to wild-type animals during HMPV infection. Moreover, the effect on these evaluated parameters was not different in IL-1\u03B2(-/-) and wild-type mice treated with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. The production of IL-1\u03B2 was also abrogated in bone marrow derived macrophages deficient for NLRP3. Finally, we show that small hydrophobic protein-deleted recombinant HMPV (HMPV \u0394SH) failed to activate caspase-1, which is responsible for IL-1\u03B2 cleavage and maturation. Furthermore, HMPV \u0394SH-infected mice had less weight loss, showed no mortality and reduced inflammation, as compared to wild-type HMPV-infected mice. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome activation seems to be triggered by HMPV SH protein in HMPV disease. In summary, once activated by the HMPV SH protein, NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the maturation of IL-1\u03B2, which exacerbates HMPV-induced inflammation. Therefore, the blockade of IL-1\u03B2 production by using NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors might be a novel potential strategy for the therapy and prevention of HMPV infection.","publish_time":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00EA, Vuong B.; Dubois, Julia; Couture, Christian; Cavanagh, Marie-H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Uyar, Olus; Pizzorno, Andres; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Hamelin, Marie-\u00C8ve; Boivin, Guy","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac5b22cca25686b387a8ea806008de5d8e41bd55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6474638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964929/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","HMPV SH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMPV disease","NLRP3 inflammasome activation","recombinant HMPV","maturation of IL","production of IL","HMPV SH protein","NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors","NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition","HMPV-induced inflammation","\u03B2 production","\u03B2-deficient","blockade of IL","prevention of HMPV infection","HMPV \u0394SH-infected mice","wild-type HMPV-infected mice","\u03B2 cleavage","wild-type mice","inflammasome activation triggers caspase","reduced inflammation","reduced mortality","reduced weight loss","protein complex","receptor protein","small hydrophobic protein","wild-type animals","activation-induced maturation of interleukin","deleterious effect","viral replication","various RNA viral diseases","bone marrow derived macrophages deficient","host defense","detrimental role","therapy","novel potential strategy","human metapneumovirus","development","evaluated parameters","implication","NOD","summary"],"language":"en"},

Curiously, this variant A372V is also resistant to amiloride. We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity. Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg(2\u002B) and Mn(2\u002B), which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S299T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity.

CD60 b and c are surface-expressed on activated germinal centre B cells and colocalize in raft-like structures on the cell surface together with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Lyn and Syk. Addition of CD60 b and c mAb together with anti-IgM/IL-4 to in vitro cultivated tonsillar B cells resulted in a costimulatory effect. During spontaneous and staurosporine-induced apoptosis a distinct population of activated annexin V\u002B/CD60 b\u002B/CD60 c- B cells was observed. CD60 b and c are also found on cells of the extrafollicular T cell area. On tonsillar T cells, CD60 b mAb had a costimulatory effect together with PHA while CD60 c mAb alone was sufficient to induce proliferation. In further contrast to B cells, during apoptosis a distinct CD60 b\u002B T cell subpopulation was not observed.

There are no approved vaccines or treatments for use in humans; however, therapeutic treatment of both NiV and HeV infection in ferrets and nonhuman primates with a cross-reactive, neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb), m102.4, targeting the G glycoprotein has been demonstrated. In a previous study, we isolated, characterized, and humanized a cross-reactive, neutralizing anti-F mAb (h5B3.1). The mAb h5B3.1 blocks the required F conformational change needed to facilitate membrane fusion and virus infection, and the epitope recognized by h5B3.1 has been structurally defined; however, the efficacy of h5B3.1 in vivo is unknown. METHODS: The postinfection antiviral activity of h5B3.1 was evaluated in vivo by administration in ferrets after NiV and HeV virus challenge. RESULTS: All subjects that received h5B3.1 from 1 to several days after infection with a high-dose, oral-nasal virus challenge were protected from disease, whereas all controls died. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first successful postexposure antibody therapy for NiV and HeV using a humanized cross-reactive mAb targeting the F glycoprotein, and the findings suggest that a combination therapy targeting both F and G should be evaluated as a therapy for NiV/HeV infection.","publish_time":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mire, Chad E; Chan, Yee-Peng; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Cross, Robert W; Yan, Lianying; Agans, Krystle N; Dang, Ha V; Veesler, David; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W; Broder, Christopher C","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3def1027f20e9d0cdec1e04054e1aa2a013c1c61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199785.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiz515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NiV","mAb h5B3","HeV infection","virus infection","HeV virus challenge","efficacy of h5B3","Hendra virus","Nipah virus","anti-F mAb","humanized cross-reactive mAb","F glycoprotein","oral-nasal virus challenge","postinfection antiviral activity of h5B3","ferrets","combination therapy","humans","G glycoprotein","successful postexposure antibody therapy","required F conformational change","severe disease","human monoclonal antibody","high-dose","membrane fusion","zoonotic paramyxoviruses","nonhuman primates","therapeutic treatment","treatments","m102","findings","approved vaccines","METHODS","animals","BACKGROUND","administration","epitope","days","RESULTS","subjects","previous study","CONCLUSIONS","controls"],"language":"en"},

Here we consider how multihost parasite transmission and evolutionary dynamics may affect the success of human and animal disease control programmes, particularly neglected diseases of the developing world. We review the different types of zoonotic interactions that occur, both ecological and evolutionary, their potential relevance for current human control activities, and make suggestions for the development of an empirical evidence base and theoretical framework to better understand and predict the outcome of such interactions. In particular, we consider whether preventive chemotherapy, the current mainstay of NTD control, can be successful without a One Health approach. Transmission within and between animal reservoirs and humans can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences, driving the evolution and establishment of drug resistance, as well as providing selective pressures for spill\u2010over, host switching, hybridizations and introgressions between animal and human parasites. Our aim here is to highlight the importance of both elucidating disease ecology, including identifying key hosts and tailoring control effort accordingly, and understanding parasite evolution, such as precisely how infectious agents may respond and adapt to anthropogenic change. Both elements are essential if we are to alleviate disease risks from NZDs in humans, domestic animals and wildlife.","publish_time":"2016-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webster, Joanne P.; Gower, Charlotte M.; Knowles, Sarah C.

RECENT FINDINGS: Rapid molecular testing and, to a lesser degree, clinical metagenomics are now being routinely used in clinical practice. While these tests allow for a breadth of interrogation not possible with conventional microbiology, they pose new challenges for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship programs. This review will summarize the most recent literature on these two categories of technologic advances and discuss the few studies that have looked at utilization and stewardship approaches. This review also highlights the future directions for both of these technologies.

Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the OT studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles. It is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the NF-\u03BA B/Nrf2 pathways and IL-6/IL-1\u03B2 expression. (3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-\u03BA B/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1\u03B2 expression.

While vaccines are effective, they have a number of limitations, and influenza strains resistant to currently available anti-influenza drugs are increasingly isolated. This necessitates the exploration of novel anti-influenza therapies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the potential of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a potent inhibitor of nucleic acid processing enzymes, to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from influenza infection. We found, by neutral red assay, that ATA was protective, and by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, confirmed that ATA reduced viral replication and release. Furthermore, while pre-treating cells with ATA failed to inhibit viral replication, pre-incubation of virus with ATA effectively reduced viral titers, suggesting that ATA may elicit its inhibitory effects by directly interacting with the virus. Electron microscopy revealed that ATA induced viral aggregation at the cell surface, prompting us to determine if ATA could inhibit neuraminidase. ATA was found to compromise the activities of virus-derived and recombinant neuraminidase. Moreover, an oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strain with H274Y was also found to be sensitive to ATA. Finally, we observed additive protective value when infected cells were simultaneously treated with ATA and amantadine hydrochloride, an anti-influenza drug that inhibits M2-ion channels of influenza A virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these data suggest that ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent by directly inhibiting the neuraminidase and could be a more effective antiviral compound when used in combination with amantadine hydrochloride.","publish_time":"2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashem, Anwar M.; Flaman, Anathea S.; Farnsworth, Aaron; Brown, Earl G.; Van Domselaar, Gary; He, Runtao; Li, Xuguang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7045ec55df870b7d611154081ae7e469883f64c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2792043.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20020057/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008350","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza infection","Influenza viruses","potent anti-influenza agent","influenza strains resistant","available anti-influenza drugs","exploration of novel anti-influenza therapies","viral replication","M2-ion channels of influenza","viral aggregation","viral titers","activities of virus","infected cells","pre-treating cells","pre-incubation of virus","amantadine hydrochloride","recombinant neuraminidase","vaccines","effective antiviral compound","antiviral agents","Madin-Darby canine kidney cells","potent inhibitor of nucleic acid processing enzymes","potential of aurintricarboxylic acid","additive protective value","oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strain","H274Y","combination","BACKGROUND","serious infections","number of limitations","neutral red assay","RT-PCR","cell surface","Electron microscopy","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","ELISA","data","release","inhibitory effects","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The full-length genomic cDNA was transcribed and its transcript was transfected by electroporation into BHK-21 together with the transcript of nucleocapsid gene. At 48h post transfection, the medium to culture the transfected BHK-21 cells was harvested and inoculated into 10-days old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) to replicate the rescued virus. After passage of the virus in ECE five times, the rescued H120 virus (R-H120) was successfully recovered. R-H120 was subsequently identified to possess the introduced silent mutation site in its genome. Some biological characteristics of R-H120 such as growth curve, EID50 and HA titers, were tested and all of them were very similar to its parent strain H120. In addition, both R-H120 and H120 induced a comparable titer of HA inhibition (HI) antibody in immunized chickens and also provided up to 85% of immune protection to the chickens that were challenged with Mass41 IBV strain. The present study demonstrated that construction of infectious clone from IBV vaccine strain H120 is possible and IBV-H120 can be use as a vaccine vector for the development of novel vaccines through molecular recombination and the modified reverse genetics approach.","publish_time":"2013-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Ying Shun; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Hong Ning; Fan, Wen Qiao; Yang, Xin; Zhang, An Yun; Zeng, Fan Ya; Zhang, Zhi Kun; Cao, Hai Peng; Zeng, Cheng","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d22198a7a3bf9933d3b8a1fde41e34828db4542d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117355.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999521/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512004646; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512004646","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bsa","ECE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV-H120","R-H120","rescued H120 virus","IBV vaccine strain H120","parent strain H120","rescued virus","virus genome","Mass41 IBV strain","Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus","ECE","construction of infectious clone","biological characteristics of R","fragments","transfected BHK","modified reverse genetics approach","vaccine vector","HA titers","immunized chickens","full-length genomic cDNA","transcript of nucleocapsid gene","comparable titer of HA inhibition","Transcription grade complete length cDNA","molecular recombination","development of novel vaccines","days old SPF embryonated chicken eggs","growth curve","ligation strategy","pMD19","antibody","EID50","restriction enzyme Bsa","times","introduced silent mutation site","present study","h post transfection","BsmB","T4 ligase reaction","See\u2019m","immune protection","cells","electroporation","passage","addition"],"language":"en"},

Traditional diagnostic methods such as stool culture and microscopic examination are limited by resources and poor sensitivity. The use of molecular diagnostics for enteropathogen detection in this region of sub-Saharan Africa has not been fully explored. We sought to identify risk factors and characterize enteropathogens from diarrheic stools of HIV-positive patients in Gondar, Ethiopia using multiplex molecular panels targeting key infectious agents. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 100 stool samples was performed. Samples were collected consecutively from HIV- positive patients presenting with diarrhea at University of Gondar Hospital clinic, a major center in NW Ethiopia. Genomic DNA was extracted from stool and processed using a multiplex molecular panel Allplex\u2122 [Seegene, Canada]. Correlations between patient characteristics, symptoms, public health risk factors, and enteropathogen type (s) were studied. Eighty-six samples were successfully analyzed by molecular methods. RESULTS: The mean age was 35 with 43% male. Eighty percent lived in an urban area, 18% had access to well water only, and 81% practiced proper hand hygiene. The majority of patients (72%) were receiving HAART with a median CD4 cell count of 362/\u03BCL. Multiple pathogens were detected in 94% of specimens, with an average of 5 enteropathogens per sample. Common bacteria, viruses, and parasites detected were Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (80%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (73%), Norovirus (16%) and B. hominis (62%). CD4 cell count \u003C 500/ \u03BCL was associated with the presence of viruses (p = 0.004) and the absence of STEC (p = 0.010). The use of HAART or CD4 levels was not associated with the number of enteropathogens detected. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrheic stool from HIV-positive outpatients in Gondar, Ethiopia had on average 5 enteropathogens present in their stool. Shigellaspp./enteroinvasive E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli are the major pathogens, not dissimilar to immunocompetent individuals in low income countries.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seid, Lubaba; Stokes, William; Bayih, Abebe Genetu; Getie, Sisay; Abere, Aberham; Tesfa, Habtie; Pillai, Dylan R.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e31625f324f8a44bca6c701f2c6e6d7c09a0830c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6069753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30064366/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3265-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shigella","E. coli","B. hominis","Shigellaspp"],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","University of Gondar Hospital","STEC"],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa","Ethiopia"],"keyphrases":["coli","stool samples","molecular methods","HIV- positive patients","HIV-positive outpatients","multiplex molecular panels","diarrheic stools of HIV","use of molecular diagnostics","multiplex molecular panel Allplex","Infectious diarrhea","NW Ethiopia","major pathogens","median CD4 cell count","CD4 levels","use of HAART","enteroinvasive","\u03BCL","enterotoxigenic","majority of patients","average","Eighty-six samples","Traditional diagnostic methods","enteropathogen detection","University of Gondar Hospital clinic","public health risk factors","enteropathogen type","major center","common problem","Common bacteria","presence of viruses","Multiple pathogens","key infectious agents","symptoms","immunocompetent individuals","patient characteristics","culture","Seegene","parasites","low income countries","resources","region of sub-Saharan Africa","microscopic examination","developing world","people","cross-sectional study","access","urban area","Canada","Correlations","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","mean age","poor sensitivity","absence of STEC","proper hand hygiene","RESULTS","percent","AIDS","Genomic DNA","Shigellaspp","male","water","number","specimens","Norovirus","hominis"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, maternal tolerance to the fetus necessitates careful regulation of immune responses. Successful pregnancy requires the maternal host to effectively balance the opposing processes of maternal immune reactivity and tolerance to the fetus. However, this balance can be perturbed by infections which are recognized as the major cause of adverse pregnancy outcome including pre-term labor. Select pathogens also pose a serious threat of severe maternal illness. These include intracellular and chronic pathogens that have evolved immune evasive strategies. Murine models of intracellular bacteria and parasites that mimic pathogenesis of infection in humans have been developed. While human epidemiological studies provide insight into maternal immunity to infection, experimental infection in pregnant mice is a vital tool to unravel the complex molecular mechanisms of placental infection, congenital transmission and maternal illness. We will provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of several infection models in pregnant mice and their clinical relevance. These models have revealed the immunological function of the placenta in responding to, and resisting infection. Murine feto-placental infection provides an effective way to evaluate new intervention strategies for managing infections during pregnancy, adverse fetal outcome and long-term effects on the offspring and mother.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krishnan, Lakshmi; Nguyen, Tina; McComb, Scott","journal":"Journal of Reproductive Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c12707e3172995780a54f27d7aff92e06c70a5e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/52be432028634f6c300d090a015003501b6c697e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3748615.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165037812006511; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2012.10.015; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3748615?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165037812006511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23432873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection models","pathogenesis of infection","experimental infection","maternal host","maternal tolerance","maternal immunity","Murine feto-placental infection","complex molecular mechanisms of placental infection","opposing processes of maternal immune reactivity","immune evasive strategies","serious threat of severe maternal illness","pregnant mice","Successful pregnancy","fetus","infections","Murine models of intracellular bacteria","balance","major cause of adverse pregnancy outcome","strong immune response sufficient","careful regulation of immune responses","adverse fetal outcome","chronic pathogens","new intervention strategies","long-term effects","effective way","congenital transmission","vital tool","insight","parasites","pre-term labor","human epidemiological studies","offspring","infectious agent","clinical relevance","mother","immunological function","ability","contrast","comprehensive review","Resistance","humans"],"language":"en"},

Over the past ten years, several groups have provided direct evidence that dendritic cells (DCs) fully support the HCMV lytic cycle. We previously demonstrated that the C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) has a prominent role in the docking of HCMV on monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). The DC-SIGN/HCMV interaction was demonstrated to be a crucial and early event that substantially enhanced infection in trans, i.e., from one CMV-bearing cell to another non-infected cell (or trans-infection), and rendered susceptible cells fully permissive to HCMV infection. Nevertheless, nothing is yet known about how HCMV enters MDDCs. In this study, we demonstrated that VHL/E HCMV virions (an endothelio/dendrotropic strain) are first internalized into MDDCs by a macropinocytosis-like process in an actin- and cholesterol-dependent, but pH-independent, manner. We observed the accumulation of virions in large uncoated vesicles with endosomal features, and the virions remained as intact particles that retained infectious potential for several hours. This trans-infection property was specific to MDDCs because monocyte-derived macrophages or monocytes from the same donor were unable to allow the accumulation of and the subsequent transmission of the virus. Together, these data allowed us to delineate the early mechanisms of the internalization and entry of an endothelio/dendrotropic HCMV strain into human MDDCs and to propose that DCs can serve as a \u0022Trojan horse\u0022 to convey CMV from entry sites to other locations that may favor the occurrence of either latency or acute infection.","publish_time":"2012-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haspot, Fabienne; Lavault, Am\u00E9lie; Sinzger, Christian; Laib Sampaio, Kerstin; Stierhof, York-Dieter; Pilet, Paul; Bressolette-Bodin, C\u00E9line; Halary, Franck","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ea0187c80591fcbe19d37343f9957859753b129.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3322158.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22496863/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034795","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","VHL/E HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV infection","docking of HCMV","HCMV interaction","E HCMV virions","dendrotropic HCMV strain","human MDDCs","HCMV lytic cycle","acute infection","trans-infection property","dendritic cells","accumulation of virions","monocyte-derived DCs","non-infected cell","endothelio","dendrotropic strain","susceptible cells","hematopoietic cells","DC-SIGN","monocyte-derived macrophages","non-integrin","entry sites","early event","Human cytomegalovirus","early mechanisms","C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule","large uncoated vesicles","endosomal features","direct evidence","groups","monocytes","prominent role","infectious potential","cholesterol-dependent","actin","donor","intact particles","locations","occurrence","process","ubiquitous herpesvirus","internalization","VHL","pH-independent","years","subsequent transmission","latency","macropinocytosis","Trojan horse","manner","hours","study","data"],"language":"en"},

With the advent of novel biologics and small molecule inhibitors, it is important to critically evaluate the role of phototherapy in dermatology. Surveys have shown that many dermatology residency programs do not dedicate time to teach residents how to prescribe or administer phototherapy. Limitations of phototherapy include access to a center, time required for treatments, and insurance approval. Home phototherapy, a viable option, is also underutilized. However, it should be emphasized that modern phototherapy has been in use for over 40 years, has an excellent safety profile, and does not require laboratory monitoring. It can be safely combined with many other treatment modalities including biologics and small molecule inhibitors. In addition, phototherapy costs significantly less than these novel agents. Dermatologists are the only group of physicians who have the expertise and proper training to deliver this treatment modality to our patients. Therefore, in order to continue to deliver high quality, cost-effective care, it is imperative that phototherapy be maintained as an integral part of the dermatology treatment armamentarium.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres, Angeli Eloise E.; Lyons, Alexis B.; Hamzavi, Iltefat H.; Lim, Henry W.","journal":"J Am Acad Dermatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3da24a2ddaffdc6ea23fb36b12a6f2c8a6309c6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.095; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190962220307118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339702/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220307118?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phototherapy costs","Home phototherapy","ABSTRACT Phototherapy","role of phototherapy","modern phototherapy","Limitations of phototherapy","dermatology treatment armamentarium","effective treatment","treatment modalities","treatment modality","small molecule inhibitors","time","advent of novel biologics","dermatology residency programs","novel agents","cost-effective care","proper training","years","high quality","expertise","treatments","access","center","group of physicians","dermatologic conditions","excellent safety profile","use","viable option","insurance approval","Dermatologists","order","Surveys","patients","addition","residents","laboratory monitoring"],"language":"en"},

In Part A, 1013 subjects were randomized into four treatment groups (5\u03BCg, 15\u03BCg, or 45\u03BCg hemagglutinin [HA] VLP vaccine or placebo) and vaccinated 21 days apart, with sera collected on Days 1, 14 and 36 for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) testing. After review of safety and immunogenicity data from Part A, additional subjects were immunized with a single dose of 15\u03BCg VLP vaccine (N =2537) or placebo (N =1011) and assessed for safety in Part B. Results showed the H1N1 2009 VLP vaccine was safe and well-tolerated. Systemic solicited events were similar between placebo and VLP vaccinated groups with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Dose response trends for solicited local adverse events were observed, with higher incidences of local pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness reported in the higher VLP dose groups (15\u03BCg and 45\u03BCg) compared to the placebo and 5\u03BCg VLP groups following both vaccinations. Although the majority of local AEs were mild in severity, a dose trend in events of moderate or greater severity was also noted for these solicited events. The VLP vaccine groups demonstrated robust HAI immune responses after a single vaccination, with high rates of seroprotection (\u226540 HAI titer) in 82\u201392% of all subjects and in 64\u201385% of subjects who were seronegative at the time of immunization. HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs), geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and seroconversion rates were also all statistically higher in the VLP groups compared to placebo for both post-baseline time points. Based on these data, additional clinical trials are in development to evaluate influenza vaccine candidate antigens manufactured using Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)/baculovirus-based VLP technology.","publish_time":"2011-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Mac\u00EDas, Constantino; Ferat-Osorio, Eduardo; Tenorio-Calvo, Alejandra; Isibasi, Armando; Talavera, Juan; Arteaga-Ruiz, Oscar; Arriaga-Pizano, Lourdes; Hickman, Somia P.; Allende, Mar\u00EDa; Lenhard, Kathy; Pincus, Steven; Connolly, Kevin; Raghunandan, Ramadevi; Smith, Gale; Glenn, Gregory","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b99136512970c5ad4257f21b5ac40218654de94b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126971.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.07.099; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11011492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21816199/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11011492","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP","HAI","Spodoptera"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["\u03BCg VLP vaccine","VLP vaccine groups","\u03BCg VLP groups","influenza VLP vaccine","VLP vaccinated groups","higher VLP dose groups","\u03BCg hemagglutinin","treatment groups","baculovirus-based VLP technology","vaccine-related serious adverse events","local adverse events","influenza vaccine candidate antigens","single dose","events of moderate","H1N1","Systemic solicited events","additional subjects","placebo-controlled study","dose trend","HAI titer","HAI geometric mean titers","Dose response trends","higher incidences of local pain","immunogenicity data","days","pandemic","review of safety","robust HAI immune responses","influenza virus genetic sequences","geometric mean ratios","majority of local AEs","single vaccination","seroconversion rates","greater severity","Abstract Virus","time of immunization","high rates of seroprotection","additional clinical trials","post-baseline time points","development","GMTs","Spodoptera frugiperda","Sf9","order","GMRs","healthy adults","hemagglutination inhibition","redness","Results","years of age","particles","VLPs","tenderness","testing","doses","onset","vaccinations","Phase","sera","Mexico","stage"],"language":"en"},

It was comprised of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,376 Da. It was hydrophobic and had a net charge of \u002B8 at neutral pH.

Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of BECV Mebus strain showed only a two-base change resulting in a 100% homology between the two amino acid sequences. Furthermore, a very conserved structure of M appeared on comparison with the Dayoff optimal alignment of MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, TGEV, IBV Beaudette and IBV 6/82M amino acid sequences. As the two strains of BECV, F15 and Mebus present some antigenic differences, this led us to reconsider the role of M in viral antigen specificity.

AIM: To elicit the anatomical distribution and physiological significance of the components of the RAS in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: An extensive online literature review including Pubmed and Medline. RESULTS: There is evidence for RAS involvement in gastrointestinal physiology and pathophysiology, with all the components required for autonomous regulation identified throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The RAS is implicated in the regulation of glucose, amino acid, fluid and electrolyte absorption and secretion, motility, inflammation, blood flow and possibly malignant disease within the gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies investigating the effects of RAS blockade in a range of conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, functional gut disorders, gastrointestinal malignancy and even intestinal ischaemia have been encouraging to date. Given the ready availability of drugs that modify the RAS and their excellent safety profile, an opportunity exists for investigation of their possible therapeutic role in a variety of human gastrointestinal diseases.

There are multiple known immunoregulatory mechanisms that appear to play a role in persistent viral infections. In the recent past, IL-10 and PD-1 have been identified to be playing a significant role in the regulation of antiviral immune responses. The evidence that viruses can escape immunologic attack by taking advantage of the host\u2019s immune system is found in LCMV infection of mice and in humans persistently infected with HIV and HCV. The recent observation that the functionally inactive T-cells during chronic viral infections can be made to regain their cytokine secretion and cytolytic abilities is very encouraging.

Method Literature review. Results The realisation in March 2003 that SARS was spreading led affected countries to introduce measures such as rapid dissemination of information, early case detection and isolation, tracing and quarantining of SARS contacts, traveller screening, raising public awareness of risk and institution of stricter infection control in health care settings. SARS became a notifiable disease in China in mid\u2010April 2003, after which introduction of efficient nationwide control measures led to containment within 2 months. Countries differed in the timeliness of implementing control measures, the mode and extent to which these were enforced and in the resources available to do so. Conclusion SARS challenged the political and public health systems of all affected countries. It demanded rapid and decisive action to be taken, yet the comparison shows how difficult this was for an unknown new disease. Guangdong reacted rapidly but this pace was not continued by China for some time, which facilitated national and international spread. Once the Chinese government changed its policy, it developed an impressive control strategy involving the public which culminated in containment.

However, numerous outbreaks of flu have been reported in groups of travelers: package tours, pilgrims, elderly people, and travel by plane or cruise ships. Nowadays vaccination against flu is not recommended in travelers unless they belong to groups at risk for flu. Nonetheless vaccination against flu is difficult to apply to travelers due to problems in vaccine availability and inadequacy between vaccine strains and strains responsible for ongoing outbreaks in the opposite hemisphere. This vaccination seems important to travelers because flu may impair their vacation. In addition, it is also interesting for the community if it limits the spread of flu worldwide.","publish_time":"2006-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ansart, S.; Caumes, E.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92cba6256a9f57a4c738d64b3535cc3c2a67a6d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119054.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X06000424; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X06000424","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["cruise"],"organizations":[],"locations":["l\u0027\u00E9tranger"],"keyphrases":["flu in travelers is unknown","to introduce it in","Nowadays vaccination against flu is","Nonetheless vaccination against flu is difficult to apply to travelers","In addition","flu worldwide","to problems in vaccine availability","The incidence","Influenza is","vaccination altruiste","vaccination antigrippale","reported in groups","ongoing outbreaks in the opposite hemisphere","recommended in travelers unless they belong to groups at risk","it is also interesting","This vaccination seems important to travelers because flu may impair their vacation","Abstract There is","the community if it limits the spread","incidence de la grippe","the traveler to acquire an exotic disease when traveling","souches circulant","voyageurs","risque","inad\u00E9quation des souches vaccinales","diffusion des souches grippales","strains responsible","inadequacy between vaccine strains","numerous outbreaks","p\u00E8lerinages","voyages","titre individuel","tours","endemic areas after returning","co\u00FBt \u00E9conomique engendr\u00E9","elderly people","probl\u00E8mes de d\u00E9livrance","pilgrims","good example","such","transports a\u00E9riens","groupes particuliers","bateaux de croisi\u00E8re","dehors de celles","pr\u00E9vention vaccinale","h\u00E9misph\u00E8re oppos\u00E9","mesure","cruise ships","affection","troisi\u00E8me \u00E2ge","maladies infectieuses","However","Nombre d\u0027\u00E9pid\u00E9mies","r\u00E9gions","retour","personnes","exemple classique","R\u00E9sum\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

Multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. In this study, we describe the detection and full genome characterization of two CoVs closely related to MERS-CoV from two Italian bats, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii. METHODS: Pool of viscera were tested by a pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Virus isolation was attempted by inoculation in different cell lines. Full genome sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent platform and phylogenetic trees were performed using IQtree software. Similarity plots of CoV clade c genomes were generated by using SSE v1.2. The three dimensional macromolecular structure (3DMMS) of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein was predicted by sequence-homology method using the protein data bank (PDB). RESULTS: Both samples resulted positive to the pan-coronavirus RT-PCR (IT-batCoVs) and their genome organization showed identical pattern of MERS CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed a monophyletic group placed in the Beta2c clade formed by MERS-CoV sequences originating from humans and camels and bat-related sequences from Africa, Italy and China. The comparison of the secondary and 3DMMS of the RBD of IT-batCoVs with MERS, HKU4 and HKU5 bat sequences showed two aa deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD in IT-batCoV and HKU5 RBDs. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported two beta CoVs closely related to MERS that were obtained from two bats belonging to two commonly recorded species in Italy (P. kuhlii and H. savii). The analysis of the RBD showed similar structure in IT-batCoVs and HKU5 respect to HKU4 sequences. Since the RBD domain of HKU4 but not HKU5 can bind to the human DPP4 receptor for MERS-CoV, it is possible to suggest also for IT-batCoVs the absence of DPP4-binding potential. More surveillance studies are needed to better investigate the potential intermediate hosts that may play a role in the interspecies transmission of known and currently unknown coronaviruses with particular attention to the S protein and the receptor specificity and binding affinity.","publish_time":"2017-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno, Ana; Lelli, Davide; de Sabato, Luca; Zaccaria, Guendalina; Boni, Arianna; Sozzi, Enrica; Prosperi, Alice; Lavazza, Antonio; Cella, Eleonora; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Cicozzi, Massimo; Vaccari, Gabriele","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a36b65d00944ef78c5bc2b7bf759122c2ac4eaf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5735805.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0907-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSE v1."],"locations":["Middle East","Africa","China"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV sequences","identical pattern of MERS CoV","batCoVs","HKU5 bat sequences","HKU4 sequences","external subdomain of MERS","bat-related sequences","RBD domain of HKU4","beta group of coronavirus","receptor binding domain","S protein","HKU5 respect","HKU5 RBDs","pan-coronavirus RT-PCR","Phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic studies","binding potential","Similarity plots of CoV clade c genomes","phylogenetic trees","DMMS","bat origin","receptor specificity","humans","human DPP4 receptor","genome organization","Italy","binding affinity","Multiple surveillance","beta CoVs","genome sequencing","genome characterization","surveillance studies","study","protein data bank","multiple host species","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Beta2c clade","Italian bats","Pipistrellus kuhlii","recorded species","monophyletic group","absence of DPP4","similar structure","Hypsugo savii","dimensional macromolecular structure","potential intermediate hosts","camels","sequence-homology method","inoculation","unknown coronaviruses","BACKGROUND","Ion Torrent platform","particular attention","severe diseases","aa deletions","Africa","role","region","interspecies transmission","different cell lines","samples","IQtree software","PDB","detection","China","Virus isolation","SSE v1","Pool of viscera","METHODS","RESULTS","comparison","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Most human coronaviruses commonly cause relatively mild respiratory illnesses; however two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can cause severe illness and death. Investigations over the past thirty-five years have illuminated many aspects of coronavirus replication. The focus of this review is the functional analysis of conserved RNA secondary structures in the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 of the betacoronavirus genomes. The 5\u2019 350 nucleotides folds into a set of RNA secondary structures which are well conserved, and reverse genetic studies indicate that these structures play an important role in the discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs in the betacoronaviruses. These cis-acting elements extend 3\u2019 of the 5\u2019UTR into ORF1a. The 3\u2019UTR is similarly conserved and contains all of the cis-acting sequences necessary for viral replication. Two competing conformations near the 5\u2019 end of the 3\u2019UTR have been shown to make up a potential molecular switch. There is some evidence that an association between the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019UTRs is necessary for subgenomic RNA synthesis, but the basis for this association is not yet clear. A number of host RNA proteins have been shown to bind to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 cis-acting regions, but the significance of these in viral replication is not clear. Two viral proteins have been identified as binding to the 5\u2019 cis-acting region, nsp1 and N protein. A genetic interaction between nsp8 and nsp9 and the region of the 3\u2019UTR that contains the putative molecular switch suggests that these two proteins bind to this region.","publish_time":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Dong; Leibowitz, Julian L.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85fe4d02c970252bd374d09ceb879165c7f6e8f6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e9c9b0ae161292a02df40687664ee8175e6c7468.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4476908.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021500115X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736566/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021500115X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.02.025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cis-acting regions","cis-acting elements","viral replication","viral proteins","cis-acting sequences necessary","subgenomic RNA synthesis","set of RNA secondary structures","functional analysis of conserved RNA secondary structures","important cause of illness","number of host RNA proteins","zoonotic coronaviruses","human coronaviruses","association","aspects of coronavirus replication","putative molecular switch","potential molecular switch","discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs","MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV","important role","severe illness","genetic interaction","reverse genetic studies","mild respiratory illnesses","nsp1","years","review","nsp8","nsp9","N protein","humans","basis","significance","UTRs","nucleotides folds","end","betacoronaviruses","animals","CoVs","competing conformations","Investigations","focus","death","betacoronavirus genomes","evidence","ORF1a"],"language":"en"},

To define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in SARS, serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, complement and specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and phenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry in 95 SARS-infected patients. Results showed that interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor \u03B2 (TGF-\u03B2) were continuously up-regulated during the entirety of SARS. Regulated on activation normally T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were decreased, while monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was elevated in acute patients. Immunoglobulins and complement were elevated during the first month of SARS.

The results indicate that the method is efficient and powerful.","publish_time":"2010-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Jie; Hu, Yong; Wan, Ping; Zhang, Aibing; Zhao, Weizhong","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/beb7a26a834f61fb7bffe43bdaa8ddfe4fd9201e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094107.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20688082/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519310003978; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.07.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519310003978","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discrimination measure","new measure","proposed method","new approach","primitive discrimination substrings of sequence S","DNA primary sequences","phylogenetic trees","independent data sets","multiple alignments","distances","utility","results","core","similarity analysis"],"language":"en"},

The consequences of a pandemic can significantly affect and disrupt a large spectrum of workforce sectors in today\u0027s society. This paper, motivated by the impact of a pandemic, extends the formulation of the dynamic inoperability input\u2013output model (DIIM) to account for economic perturbations resulting from such an event, which creates a time-varying and probabilistic inoperability to the workforce. A pandemic is a unique disaster, because the majority of its direct impacts are workforce related and it does not create significant direct impact to infrastructure. In light of this factor, this paper first develops a method of translating unavailable workforce into a measure of economic-sector inoperability. While previous formulations of the DIIM only allowed for the specification of an initial perturbation, this paper incorporates the fact that a pandemic can cause direct effects to the workforce over the recovery period. Given the uncertainty associated with the impact of a pandemic, this paper develops a simulation framework to account for the possible variations in realizations of the pandemic. The enhancements to the DIIM formulation are incorporated into a MatLab program and then applied to a case study to simulate a pandemic scenario in the Commonwealth of Virginia.","publish_time":"2009-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Orsi, Mark J.; Santos, Joost R.","journal":"IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern A Syst Hum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22447573753e1520b082ceaf720e9fa5f597fa92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176465.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tsmca.2009.2033032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Commonwealth"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic scenario","pandemic outbreak","paper","unavailable workforce","DIIM formulation","significant direct impact","account","large spectrum of workforce sectors","sector inoperability","probabilistic inoperability","direct effects","direct impacts","dynamic inoperability input","measure of economic","economic perturbations","output model","possible variations","major planning scenarios","majority","simulation framework","today\u0027s society","emergency-preparedness policymakers","realizations","initial perturbation","case study","event","time","specification","MatLab program","Commonwealth of Virginia","unique disaster","infrastructure","method","recovery period","previous formulations","light","factor","enhancements","uncertainty","consequences"],"language":"en"},

In an effort to generate effective methods of H5N1 air removal and ensure the safety of laboratory personnel, this study was designed to investigate the characteristics of aerosolized H5N1 produced by laboratory manipulations during research studies. RESULTS: Normal laboratory procedures used to process the influenza virus were carried out independently and the amount of virus polluting the on-site atmosphere was measured. In particular, zootomy, grinding, centrifugation, pipetting, magnetic stirring, egg inoculation, and experimental zoogenetic infection were performed. In addition, common accidents associated with each process were simulated, including breaking glass containers, syringe injection of influenza virus solution, and rupturing of centrifuge tubes. A micro-cluster sampling ambient air pollution collection device was used to collect air samples. The collected viruses were tested for activity by measuring their ability to induce hemagglutination with chicken red blood cells and to propagate in chicken embryos after direct inoculation, the latter being detected by reverse-transcription PCR and HA test. The results showed that the air samples from the normal centrifugal group and the negative-control group were negative, while all other groups were positive for H5N1. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there are numerous sources of aerosols in laboratory operations involving H5N1. Thus, laboratory personnel should be aware of the exposure risk that accompanies routine procedures involved in H5N1 processing and take proactive measures to prevent accidental infection and decrease the risk of virus aerosol leakage beyond the laboratory.","publish_time":"2012-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhiping; Li, Jinsong; Zhang, Yandong; Li, Lin; Ma, Limin; Li, Dan; Gao, Feng; Xia, Zhiping","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5759e5ac8b1cc3c13ba04aded6e588a059ad92a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3439333.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22866888/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["laboratory manipulations","laboratory operations","laboratory environment","Normal laboratory procedures","H5N1 processing","air samples","safety of laboratory personnel","Avian H5N1 influenza viruses","effective methods of H5N1 air removal","characteristics of aerosolized H5N1","syringe injection of influenza virus solution","risk of virus aerosol leakage","RESULTS","negative-control group","normal centrifugal group","micro-cluster sampling ambient air pollution collection device","egg inoculation","routine procedures","chicken embryos","exposure risk","direct inoculation","accidental infection","collected viruses","experimental zoogenetic infection","chicken red blood cells","pipetting","challenge","breaking glass containers","magnetic stirring","centrifugation","hemagglutination","numerous sources of aerosols","proactive measures","reverse-transcription PCR","HA test","ability","small size","study","BACKGROUND","research studies","low concentration","findings","zootomy","common accidents","activity","effort","groups","centrifuge tubes","addition","on-site atmosphere","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The sCOE\u2013Co1 fusion gene was introduced into rice calli via the particle bombardment-mediated transformation method. The stable integration and transcriptional expression of the sCOE\u2013Co1 fusion gene was confirmed by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. The expression of the COE\u2013Co1 fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The highest expression level of the COE\u2013Co1 fusion protein reached 0.083 % of the total soluble protein according to quantitative densitometry of Western blot analysis. Mice immunized with transgenic rice calli protein extracts induced significant serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody levels against purified bacterial COE.

Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (FPMRS) must provide high quality of care through remote access such as telemedicine. No clear guidelines exist on the use of telemedicine in FPMRS. Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic. METHODS: We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms. We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines. We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments. Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented guidance for treating FPMRS conditions via telemedicine based on rapid literature review and expert consensus and presented it in a format that can be actively referenced.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grimes, Cara L.; Balk, Ethan M.; Crisp, Catrina C.; Antosh, Danielle D.; Murphy, Miles; Halder, Gabriela E.; Jeppson, Peter C.; Weber LeBrun, Emily E.; Raman, Sonali; Kim-Fine, Shunaha; Iglesia, Cheryl; Dieter, Alexis A.; Yurteri-Kaplan, Ladin; Adam, Gaelen; Meriwether, Kate V.","journal":"Int Urogynecol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f31c88219634d1ee0df6fc4ce7148b1e78fb3ec9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342112/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-020-04314-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Female Pelvic Medicine","Reconstructive Surgeons"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of FPMRS patients","FPMRS conditions","virtual management","conservative management","pessary management","virtual setting","current management paradigms","urinary incontinence","use of telemedicine","person visits","rapid literature review","line virtual treatments","expedited literature review methodology","management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios","guidance","urinary retention","topics","expert consensus","confirmed COVID","pandemic","risks of COVID","transmission","urinary tract infections","way providers care","fecal incontinence","different treatments","conservative counseling","clear guidelines","high quality of care","defecatory dysfunction","Reconstructive Surgeons","remote access","specific considerations","existing systematic reviews","Female Pelvic Medicine","symptoms","Certain situations","desire","HYPOTHESIS","curve","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","format","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Currently available literature on impact of COVID-19 on cancer was reviewed with special reference to its applicability to the Indian context. RESULTS: Cancer cases are more susceptible for COVID-19 infection and rapid deterioration if they get infected. A tumour board should plan their management with a \u201Cdo no harm\u201D approach as the guiding principle. Teleconsultation may be used to advise patients for therapy and symptom control measures, as well as to advise new patients regarding diagnostic tests. Surgical decision making may be stratified into three categories: patients with low (not life threatening) or intermediate (potential for future morbidity or mortality) acuity may be delayed; those with high acuity may be taken up for planned therapy after explaining the risks. Assessment of the severity of disease, comorbid conditions, and logistic challenges, along with COVID census in their area are important variables for informed and individualized decision making. Safety of healthcare personnel needs to be ensured at the same time.

Recent reports suggest that ACE2, which is the target protein to invade the host, has a ubiquitous presence in human organs, including lung parenchyma, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, renal and urinary tract, airway epithelia, lymphoid tissues, reproductive organs, vascular endothelium and neurons. In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic. In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population. Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient treated with natalizumab for relapsing MS who developed COVID-19 and recovered in a few days without complications. RESULTS: After recovery natalizumab has been administered in the window of the extended interval dosing (EID), without reporting any worsening or new symptoms. DISCUSSION: This case supports the opportunity to avoid discontinuing or delaying the retreatment over 8 weeks in patients recovered from a recent COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borriello, Giovanna; Ianniello, Antonio","journal":"Mult Scler Relat Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05f51821fbd690cb484ef52e147871b04fd88c9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191299.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102165; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820302418?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388451/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820302418","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PML"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["recent COVID","natalizumab forces","recovery natalizumab","MS patients","recent outbreak","Recent reports","reproductive organs","urinary tract","gastrointestinal tract","human organs","risk of infections","relapsing MS","particular context","serious opportunistic infections","de-risking strategies","specific therapeutic strategies","global pandemic impacting","high-efficacy treatment","lymphoid tissues","airway epithelia","nasal mucosa","lung parenchyma","vascular endothelium","DMTs","ubiquitous presence","available data","EID","host","extended interval dosing","immunomodulatory effects","countries","morbidity","neurons","ACE2","window","disease","novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV","Development of PML","worsening","target protein","BACKGROUND","therapies","Wuhan","China","weeks","DISCUSSION","case","opportunity","new symptoms","paper","general population","world","retreatment","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Intranasal (IN) administration of pIC has recently been used to adjuvant influenza virus vaccines; however, the effects of IN pIC administration on pulmonary T cell responses remain unclear. Here we show that a single IN administered dose of dsRNA into mice induced local Th1 chemokine production in the lungs and airways, and generated a biphasic and sustained migration of T lymphocytes to the airways. Furthermore, IN pIC-induced chemokine production and T cell recruitment to the airways were interferon-\u03B1 receptor (IFNAR) signaling dependent. The effect of dsRNA on T cell recruitment to the airways was also dependent on the presence of high molecular weight (HMW) pIC, as a low molecular weight (LMW) pIC preparation known to only interact with TLR3 did not elicit the same effect on T cell migration to the airways, suggesting that the observed effects were dependent upon dsRNA recognition by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PPRs). IN pIC was additionally capable of stimulating low levels of T cell proliferation in the draining lymph nodes approximately 4\u20136 days after treatment that preceded a small population of de-novo T cells found in the airways by day 10. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the adjuvant effect of IN pIC that results in enhanced T cell proliferation and sustained T cell recruitment to the airways requires multiple PRRs and IFNAR signaling.","publish_time":"2012-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"McNally, Beth; Willette, Meredith; Ye, Fang; Partida-Sanchez, Santiago; Fla\u00F1o, Emilio","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64c22236bc20680680fffab70eedef1f21641bd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3517467.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23236482/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051351","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airways","T cell migration","sustained T cell recruitment","administration of pIC","pIC administration","enhanced T cell proliferation","pulmonary T cell responses","pIC preparation","low levels of T cell proliferation","sustained migration of T lymphocytes","pIC-induced chemokine production","effect of dsRNA","dsRNA recognition","adjuvant effect","synthetic dsRNA","small population of de-novo T cells","low molecular weight","administered dose of dsRNA","IFNAR","results","multiple pattern recognition receptors","local Th1 chemokine production","presence of high molecular weight","multiple PRRs","observed effects","immune responses","adjuvant influenza virus vaccines","mice","HMW","draining lymph nodes","interferon-\u03B1 receptor","lungs","LMW","days","PPRs","acts","Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytoidylic acid","treatment","protection","TLR3"],"language":"en"},

Two kinds of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a commercial shell vial viral culture were performed to identify causative agents in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates of 220 children diagnosed with viral pneumonia were obtained. Two kinds of multiplex PCR (Seeplex\u2122 RV detection kit, and Labopass\u2122 RV detection kit), and a shell vial culture by R-Mix were performed. RESULTS: Positive samples from 220 total samples by two multiplex PCRs were 52.7% and 46.4%, respectively. We also cultured 103 samples that showed positive results of the adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by two multiplex PCR. The RSV was most frequently detected in 53.0% (Seeplex) and 51.7% (Labopass) of patients. The detection rate of adenovirus (AdV) was 10.3% and 12.1%, influenza virus (IFV) A and B was 12.5% and 3.4%, and parainfluenza virus (PIFV) 1, 2, and 3 were 2.9% and 2.6%. Shell vial cultures showed concordant results with each multiplex PCR by 96.1% and 77.7%, respectively. Sequencing results were 90% consistent with multiplex PCR. CONCLUSION: Multiplex PCR showed more positivity than the shell vial culture and it can be an effective primary test. Other complementary efforts such as viral cultures and sequencing analysis could be considered, according to clinical and laboratory conditions.","publish_time":"2010-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jong-Han; Chun, Jin-Kyong; Kim, Dong Soo; Park, Yongjung; Choi, Jong Rak; Kim, Hyon-Suk","journal":"Yonsei Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d92992c5c544e78fdc31b8d52a1aa14c84ef0807.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2908874.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2010.51.5.761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20635453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","Multiplex PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kinds of multiplex PCR","multiplex PCRs","parainfluenza virus","Shell vial cultures","commercial shell vial viral culture","positive results","Sequencing results","respiratory syncytial virus","viral cultures","concordant results","Positive samples","kinds of multiplex polymerase chain reaction","RV detection kit","detection rate of adenovirus","total samples","Labopass","viral pneumonia","Seeplex","RSV","lower respiratory infection of pediatric patients","Early identification of causative agents","sequencing analysis","positivity","children","morbidity","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","METHODS","PURPOSE","R-Mix","complementary efforts","MATERIALS","AdV","CONCLUSION","effective primary test","laboratory conditions","overuse of antimicrobials","PIFV"],"language":"en"},

To understand the evolution of HBV\u2010related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to correlate these SNPs with chronic HBV infection among different populations, we conducted a global perspective study on hepatitis\u2010related SNPs. We selected 12 HBV\u2010related SNPs on the HLA locus and two HBV and three hepatitis C virus immune\u2010related SNPs for analysis. Five nasopharyngeal carcinoma\u2010related SNPs served as controls. All SNP data worldwide from 26 populations were downloaded from 1,000 genomes. We found a dramatic difference in the allele frequency in most of the HBV\u2010 and HLA\u2010related SNPs in East Asia compared to the other continents. A sharp change in allele frequency in 8 of 12 SNPs was found between Bengali populations in Bangladesh and Chinese Dai populations in Xishuangbanna, China (P \u003C 0.001); these areas represent the junction of South and East Asia. For the immune\u2010related SNPs, significant changes were found after leaving Africa. Most of these genes shifted from higher expression genotypes in Africa to lower expression genotypes in either Europe or South Asia (P \u003C 0.001). During this two\u2010stage adaptation, immunity adjusted toward a weak immune response, which could have been a survival strategy during human migration to East Asia. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Africa is as high as in Asia; however, the HBV\u2010related SNP genotypes are not present in Africa, and so the genetic mechanism of chronic HBV infection in Africa needs further exploration. Conclusion: Two stages of genetic changes toward a weak immune response occurred when humans migrated out of Africa. These changes could be a survival strategy for avoiding cytokine storms and surviving in new environments.

METHODS: Two deliberative forums were carried out with members of the South Australian community. The forums were supported by a qualitative study with adults and youths, systematic reviews of the literature and the involvement of an extended group of academic experts and policy makers. The forum discussions were recorded with simultaneous transcription and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Participants allocated scarce resources of antiviral drugs and pandemic vaccine based on a desire to preserve society function in a time of crisis. Participants were divided on the acceptability of social distancing and quarantine measures. However, should such measures be adopted, they thought that reasonable financial, household and psychological support was essential. In addition, provided such support was present, the participants, in general, were willing to impose strict sanctions on those who violated quarantine and social distancing measures. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations from the forums suggest that the implementation of pandemic plans in a severe pandemic will be challenging, but not impossible. Implementation may be more successful if the public is engaged in pandemic planning before a pandemic, effective communication of key points is practiced before and during a pandemic and if judicious use is made of supportive measures to assist those in quarantine or affected by social isolation measures.","publish_time":"2010-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braunack-Mayer, Annette J; Street, Jackie M; Rogers, Wendy A; Givney, Rodney; Moss, John R; Hiller, Janet E","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/797c6ecb7d0eb5d6eb5ea5f081a3c4cc78be5bd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2931476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20718996/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-501","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic vaccine","severe pandemic","quarantine measures","aspects of pandemic planning","background of pandemic threat","implementation of pandemic plans","social distancing measures","deliberative forums","Participants","supportive measures","social isolation measures","acceptability of social distancing","qualitative study","psychological support","informed community perspectives","South Australian community","scarce resources of antiviral drugs","youths","avian H5N1 influenza","SARS","extended group of academic experts","literature","involvement","systematic reviews","household","adults","members","effective communication of key points","policy makers","society function","desire","judicious use","strict sanctions","forum discussions","simultaneous transcription","time of crisis","RESULTS","public","addition","CONCLUSIONS","recommendations","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

To better understand Arb mechanism of action, we investigated its interactions with phospholipids and membrane peptides. We demonstrate that Arb associates with phospholipids in the micromolar range. NMR reveals that Arb interacts with the polar head-group of phospholipid at the membrane interface. Fluorescence studies of interactions between Arb and either tryptophan derivatives or membrane peptides reconstituted into liposomes show that Arb interacts with tryptophan in the micromolar range. Interestingly, apparent binding affinities between lipids and tryptophan residues are comparable with those of Arb IC50 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) membrane fusion. Since tryptophan residues of membrane proteins are known to bind preferentially at the membrane interface, these data suggest that Arb could increase the strength of virus glycoprotein\u0027s interactions with the membrane, due to a dual binding mode involving aromatic residues and phospholipids. The resulting complexation would inhibit the expected viral glycoprotein conformational changes required during the fusion process.

In this study, viral metagenomics was used to identify what viruses are present in Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected in the Zambezi Valley of Mozambique. Methods: The RNA was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The generated sequences were subjected to quality check and classfied by BLAST. CodonCode aligner and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences. Results: The majority of viral sequences showed closest sequence identity to the Orthomyxoviridae family, although viruses similar to the Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) were obtained and these showed an amino acid identity of 32\u201352% to known quaranjaviruses. The sequences were most closely related to the Wellfleet Bay virus, detected and isolated from common eider during a mortality event in the USA. Conclusions: In summary, this study has identified a highly divergent virus with in the Orthomyxoviridae family associated with Rhipicephalus ticks from Mozambique. Further genetic and biological studies are needed in order to investigate potential pathogenesis of the identified orthomyxovirus.","publish_time":"2018-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cholleti, Harindranath; Hayer, Juliette; Mulandane, Fernando Chanisso; Falk, Kerstin; Fafetine, Jose; Berg, Mikael; Blomstr\u00F6m, Anne-Lie","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdfa3f7c065622bfb2c811f71fc0dbae5b1a4d3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5974704.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2018.1478585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29868166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":["Zambezi Valley","Mozambique","Wellfleet Bay"],"keyphrases":["generated sequences","complete sequences","majority of viral sequences","Rhipicephalus ticks","Orthomyxoviridae family","study","identified orthomyxovirus","closest sequence identity","viruses similar","divergent virus","viral metagenomics","African swine fever","Wellfleet Bay virus","amino acid identity","Zambezi Valley of Mozambique","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever","sequence-independent single primer amplification","SISPA","tick-borne encephalitis","well-known disease-causing agents","primary vectors","animal populations","orthomyxoviral segments","PB1","NP","human","high-throughput sequencing","mortality event","common eider","order","PB2","potential pathogenesis","quality check","biological studies","Ion Torrent platform","RNA","Parvoviridae","Coronaviridae","Background","SeqMan","Results","CodonCode aligner","USA","BLAST","Conclusions","summary","Methods","quaranjaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Results 134 students were included. 73.9%, 38.8% and 5.0% of students reported gastrointestinal, respiratory and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was 53% and 41%, respectively. The acquisition of respiratory viruses was low but associated with persisting symptoms, while bacterial acquisition ranged from 3.3% for Streptococcus pyogenes to 15.0% for Haemophilus influenzae. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates were 7.7% and 14.3% respectively. Five students (5.1%) had molecular quantification criteria for bacterial vaginosis on return. Conclusion This preliminary study demonstrates that besides the known risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections and associated changes in intestinal and respiratory microbiota, medical students abroad may also experience changes in vaginal microbiota leading, in some cases, to clinical symptoms or the acquisition of bacterial vaginosis, which may be asymptomatic.","publish_time":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dao, Thi Loi; Hoang, Van Thuan; Ly, Tran Duc Anh; Magmoun, Amal; Canard, Naomie; Drali, Tassadit; Fenollar, Florence; Ninove, Laetitia; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe; Courjon, Johan; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"Travel Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae452865fcba8e8bff927f3f00dbf488a2838774.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102604.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893919302698; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31870880/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893919302698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Streptococcus","Gardnerella"],"organizations":["Atopobium"],"locations":["France","Marseille"],"keyphrases":["bacterial acquisition","acquisition of respiratory viruses","acquisition of bacterial vaginosis","respiratory microbiota","vaginal symptoms","acquisition of pathogen carriage","cohort of medical students","respiratory infections","persisting symptoms","vaginal microbiota","vaginal pathogen carriage","Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates","acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli","clinical symptoms suggestive of infectious diseases","associated changes","France","known risk of gastrointestinal","Methods Clinical follow","internships","EAEC","qPCR","health problems","previous studies","Enteropathogenic","Gardnerella vaginalis","molecular quantification criteria","return","travel","Marseille","cases","preliminary study","Abstract Background","Streptococcus pyogenes","Haemophilus influenzae","Conclusion","EPEC","Results"],"language":"en"},

The health monitoring scenario investigates the feasibility of health monitoring at public spaces (i.e. airports, subways, malls). Five state of the art heart rate measuring methods were re-implemented and tested with the feasibility study database. The results were compared with ground truth to estimate the heart rate measurement error.

RNA virus detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi29 DNA polymerase cannot amplify RNA nor small cDNA fragments (\u003C2000 bases) obtained by reverse transcription of certain viral RNA genomes. Therefore, ligation of cDNA fragments is necessary prior phi29 polymerase based amplification. We adapted the QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit (Qiagen) to our purposes and designated the method as Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA). RESULTS: WTA successfully amplified cDNA from a panel of RNA viruses representing the diversity of ribovirus genome sizes. We amplified a range of genome copy numbers from 15 to 4 \u00D7 10(7 )using WTA, which yielded quantities of amplified DNA as high as 1.2 \u03BCg/\u03BCl or 10(10 )target copies. The amplification factor varied between 10(9 )and 10(6). We also demonstrated that co-amplification occurred when viral RNA was mixed with bacterial DNA. CONCLUSION: This is the first report in the scientific literature showing that a modified WGA (WTA) approach can be successfully applied to viral genomic RNA of all sizes. Amplifying viral RNA by WTA provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of detection compared to random RT-PCR.","publish_time":"2008-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berthet, Nicolas; Reinhardt, Anita K; Leclercq, India; van Ooyen, Sven; Bat\u00E9jat, Christophe; Dickinson, Philip; Stamboliyska, Rayna; Old, Iain G; Kong, Katherine A; Dacheux, Laurent; Bourhy, Herv\u00E9; Kennedy, Giulia C; Korfhage, Christian; Cole, Stewart T; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude","journal":"BMC Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/155cca2a90a5430ac391b46983efa4c13f193289.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2535778.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2199-9-77; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18771595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit","Whole Transcriptome Amplification","WTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WTA","viral genomic RNA","amplified cDNA","Transcriptome Amplification","phi29 DNA polymerase","RNA virus detection","panel of RNA viruses","quantities of amplified DNA","amplification methods","co-amplification","amplification factor","reverse transcription of certain viral RNA genomes","bacterial DNA","necessary prior phi29 polymerase","small cDNA fragments","ligation of cDNA fragments","accuracy of detection","diversity of ribovirus genome sizes","Transcriptome Kit","range of genome","minimal changes","sequence","relative abundance","better sensitivity","modified WGA","bases","scientific literature","Qiagen","\u03BCg","approach","BACKGROUND","random RT-PCR","biomedical applications","report","\u03BCl","purposes","QuantiTect","microarrays","challenge","RESULTS","numbers","target copies","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool\u2019s feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app\u2019s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England\u0027s guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura\u2019s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meinert, Edward; Milne-Ives, Madison; Surodina, Svitlana; Lam, Ching","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348293/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19297","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Public Health England"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["app development framework","future app development","social interaction","social distancing measures","mental health","social relationships","multistage app development","health systems","space of social isolation","feasibility study design","digital health products","health behavior change","software design","older people","case study design","time of publication","project","pre-existing software framework","Bandura\u2019s model of health promotion","Public Health England\u0027s guidance","study execution","time progresses","real time use","families","software engineering","usability","future studies","acceptability","app\u2019s feasibility","COVID","tool\u2019s feasibility","solution","particular challenges","self-isolation","shielding measures","virtual interaction","Anonymized data","agile methods","evidence-based exemplar","real-world data sources","Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance","RE-AIM","contact","societal issues","peer groups","track","machine learning algorithm","physical activity","Nonadoption","transmission","peers","foundations","identification of patients","positive nutrition","continuous improvement","online community","novel contribution","proof of concept","systematic means","Abandonment","goal setting","prediscovery iteration","place","compounding impact","Ethical approval","deployment","BACKGROUND","coronavirus disease","Scale","Suitability","evaluation","well-being","loneliness","Grant submissions","concerns","RESULTS","NASSS","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Closure of live poultry markets in some affected cities dramatically reduced numbers of cases during summer of 2013, but the epidemic resurged during the winter 2013\u201314, increasing reported cases to 393 in Mainland China as of 30 March 2014. PURPOSE: The study aimed to explore population behavior patterns responding to an epidemic of influenza A(H7N9) virus. METHOD: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1000, 680, and 1011 respondents in December 2013, January 2014, and February 2014, with response rates of 68.0, 64.4, and 66.6 %, respectively, in Hong Kong. Adults were recruited and interviewed using random digit-dialing telephone survey. Latent class analysis was employed to explore heterogeneity in protective behavior patterns across the three surveys. Multinomial regression models were developed to determine factors associated with latent class membership. RESULTS: Three comparable latent classes were identified across the three surveys: Moderate hygiene compliance (Class 1), High hygiene compliance (Class 2), and Vigilance (Class 3). The prevalence of Class 1 was 48\u201352 % across the three surveys while Class 3 prevalence increased significantly from 13 % in the Dec-2013 survey to 20 % in the Feb-2014 survey. Compared with Class 1, Class 3 were more likely to be female, older, better educated, married, perceive higher susceptibility to H7N9, attribute greater severity to H7N9, report higher current worry, and anticipated worry about H7N9 infection. CONCLUSION: The three classes reflect different levels of adoption of protection and thereby may have different levels of vulnerability toward contracting H7N9 infection. It appears that as the epidemic intensifies, Class 2 (Good hygiene compliance) members are likely to transfer to Class 3 (Vigilance) while Class 1 (Moderate hygiene compliance) could be unchanged. The young, mostly single males and those with lower educational achievement represent a group for whom public health messages need to be targeted.","publish_time":"2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Wu, Peng; Leung, Gabriel M.; Fielding, Richard; Lam, Wendy Wing Tak","journal":"Int J Behav Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1794d19a6eb6add0cec136676c1fd9d9e634695e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090479.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-015-9465-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25622816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mainland China"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of Class","latent class membership","Latent class analysis","Moderate hygiene compliance","contracting H7N9 infection","Good hygiene compliance","High hygiene compliance","epidemic of influenza","cross-sectional surveys","virus","comparable latent classes","Mainland China","Vigilance","telephone survey","higher current worry","different levels of vulnerability","different levels of adoption","population behavior patterns","protective behavior patterns","anticipated worry","higher susceptibility","numbers of cases","reported cases","novel avian influenza","attribute greater severity","group","affected cities","lower educational achievement","protection","factors","heterogeneity","single males","Closure of live poultry markets","study","random digit","public health messages","BACKGROUND","summer","RESULTS","Multinomial regression models","winter","METHOD","CONCLUSION","outbreak","humans","response rates","Hong Kong","Adults","PURPOSE","respondents"],"language":"en"},

Neurochem. (2011) 116, 105\u2013121. ABSTRACT: This study examines the Cav1 isoforms expressed in mouse chromaffin cells and compares their biophysical properties and roles played in cell excitability and exocytosis. Using immunocytochemical and electrophysiological techniques in mice lacking the Cav1.3\u03B11 subunit (Cav1.3(\u2212/\u2212)) or the high sensitivity of Cav1.2\u03B11 subunits to dihydropyridines, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels were identified as the only Cav1 channel subtypes expressed in mouse chromaffin cells. Cav1.3 channels were activated at more negative membrane potentials and inactivated more slowly than Cav1.2 channels. Cav1 channels, mainly Cav1.2, control cell excitability by functional coupling to BK channels, revealed by nifedipine blockade of BK channels in wild type (WT) and Cav1.3(\u2212/\u2212) cells (53% and 35%, respectively), and by the identical change in the shape of the spontaneous action potentials elicited by the dihydropyridine in both strains of mice. Cav1.2 channels also play a major role in spontaneous action potential firing, supported by the following evidence: (i) a similar percentage of WT and Cav1.3(\u2212/\u2212) cells fired spontaneous action potentials; (ii) firing frequency did not vary between WT and Cav1.3(\u2212/\u2212) cells; (iii) mostly Cav1.2 channels contributed to the inward current preceding the action potential threshold; and (iv) in the presence of tetrodotoxin, WT or Cav1.3(\u2212/\u2212) cells exhibited spontaneous oscillatory activity, which was fully abolished by nifedipine perfusion. Finally, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels were essential for controlling the exocytotic process at potentials above and below \u221210 mV, respectively. Our data reveal the key yet differential roles of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels in mediating action potential firing and exocytotic events in the neuroendocrine chromaffin cell.","publish_time":"2010-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez\u2010Alvarez, Alberto; Hern\u00E1ndez\u2010Vivanco, Alicia; Caba\u2010Gonz\u00E1lez, Jose Carlos; Albillos, Almudena","journal":"J Neurochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78dc05173265b4e4e8e35ddcf3f57d2a20226e5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197458.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.07089.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21054386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

HCMV infection has for a long time been known to be associated with various autoimmune manifestations and the formation of autoantibodies. Previous studies from our group have shown that HCMV is associated with a human protein, CD13 (aminopeptidase N) and that autoantibodies against this protein are frequently found in HCMV infected bone marrow transplant patients with chronic graft versus host disease. We have recently observed that 90% of IBD patients have an active HCMV infection. In this study, we examined the presence and cytotoxicity of CD13-specific autoantibodies in sera obtained from 28 patients with ulcerative colitis and 26 patients with Crohn\u0027s disease, and in sera obtained from healthy blood donors by using flow cytometric assays against mouse cells transfected with human CD13 or a microcytotoxicity assay against different CD13 positive human cells. Cytotoxic CD13-specific autoantibodies were identified in 66% of the sera obtained from HCMV-IgG positive patients with ulcerative colitis and in 58% of the sera obtained from HCMV-IgG positive patients with Crohn\u0027s disease, but not in control individuals. These cytotoxic autoantibodies may interfere with biological cell functions and could thereby contribute to the chronic inflammation in patients with IBD.","publish_time":"2006-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahbar, A.; Bostr\u00F6m, L.; S\u00F6derberg-Naucler, C.","journal":"J Autoimmun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dfc268faf15bf154aa7e5e025e0512aa272eb10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125970.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841106000151; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841106000151","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV-IgG positive patients","IBD patients","human CD13","active HCMV infection","sera","Crohn\u0027s disease","Cytotoxic CD13-specific autoantibodies","cytotoxic autoantibodies","HCMV infected bone marrow transplant patients","different CD13 positive human cells","human protein","host disease","cytotoxicity of CD13","formation of autoantibodies","exact pathogenic role of HCMV","human cytomegalovirus","inflammatory bowel disease","ulcerative colitis","chronic graft","mouse cells","chronic inflammation","microcytotoxicity assay","flow cytometric assays","association","healthy blood donors","aminopeptidase N","presence","various autoimmune manifestations","biological cell functions","Recent evidence","group","long time","control individuals","Previous studies","study"],"language":"en"},

It informs on both undiagnosed cases and on the effects of health system disruption. Methods: We aimed at evaluating the extent of the total death excess during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Data from 4433 municipalities providing mortality reports until April 15th, 2020 were included for a total of 34.5 million residents from all Italian regions. Data were analyzed by region, sex and age, and compared to expected from 2015-2019. Results: In both genders, overall mortality was stable until February 2020 and abruptly increased from March 1st onwards. Within the municipalities studied, 77,339 deaths were observed in the period between March 1st to April 15th, 2020, in contrast to the 50,822.6 expected. The rate ratio was 1.11 before age 60 and 1.55 afterwards. Both sexes were affected. The excess was greater in the regions most affected by COVID-19 but always exceeded the deaths attributed to COVID-19. The extrapolation to the total Italian population suggests an excess of 45,033 deaths in the study period, while the number of COVID-19 deaths was 21,046. Conclusion: Our paper shows a large death excess during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy; greater than the number attributed to it. Possible causes included both the undetected cases and the disruption of the Health Service organization. Timely monitoring of overall mortality based on unbiased nationwide data is an essential tool for epidemic control.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magnani, Corrado; Azzolina, Danila; Gallo, Elisa; Ferrante, Daniela; Gregori, Dario","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429172/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103452","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Health Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deaths","number of COVID","total death excess","mortality reports","epidemic control","large death excess","total Italian population","Timely monitoring of overall mortality","Italian regions","Italy","age","municipalities","unbiased nationwide data","population burden","undetected cases","effects of health system disruption","undiagnosed cases","study period","Health Service organization","essential tool","relevant indicator","paper","genders","Possible causes","residents","Objective","extrapolation","extent","Conclusion","rate ratio","Results","contrast","Methods","sexes"],"language":"en"},

We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5\u2032-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattle-infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NF\u03BAB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5\u2032-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place.","publish_time":"2017-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perrone, Rosalba; Lavezzo, Enrico; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio; Richter, Sara N.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c18f2bf81bf9b00f2a628d540151912b2dfe980.json; document_parses/pdf_json/35173a96f21f1e674e63d473864215d025f76d0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5435695.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-02291-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTR G4s","LTR","G4s"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unfolding LTR G4s","presence of LTR G4s","primate lentivirus LTR G4s","unfolding of G4s","stable G4s","dynamic G4s","LTR G4 region","LTR G4 sequences","LTR U3 region","unique viral LTR promoter","non-primate lentiviruses","related primate viruses","G4 ligands","control centre of viral transcription","HIV","human immunodeficiency lentivirus","cattle-infecting lentivirus","cellular processes","Cellular proteins","Sp1","stabilization","secondary structures of nucleic acids","multiple recruitment of factors","NF\u03BAB binding sites","hints","strong correlation","complexity","effect","G-quadruplexes","investigation","possibility","place","polymerase","assay","data","role","strains","common ancestor"],"language":"en"},

A One Health approach emphasizing inter-disciplinary co-operation is increasingly seen as necessary for effective EID control and prevention. There are, however, socio-political, ethical and legal challenges, which must be met by such a One Health approach. DISCUSSION: Based on the philosophical review and critical analysis of scholarship around the theory and practice of One Health it is clear that EID events are not simply about pathogens jumping species barriers; they are comprised of complex and contingent sets of relations that involve socioeconomic and socio-political drivers and consequences with the latter extending beyond the impact of the disease. Therefore, the effectiveness of policies based on One Health depends on their implementation and alignment with or modification of public values. SUMMARY: Despite its strong motivating rationale, implementing a One Health approach in an integrated and considered manner can be challenging, especially in the face of a perceived crisis. The effective control and prevention of EIDs therefore requires: (i) social science research to improve understanding of how EID threats and responses play out; (ii) the development of an analytic framework that catalogues case experiences with EIDs, reflects their dynamic nature and promotes inter-sectoral collaboration and knowledge synthesis; (iii) genuine public engagement processes that promote transparency, education and capture people\u2019s preferences; (iv) a set of practical principles and values that integrate ethics into decision-making procedures, against which policies and public health responses can be assessed; (v) integration of the analytic framework and the statement of principles and values outlined above; and (vi) a focus on genuine reform rather than rhetoric.","publish_time":"2015-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Degeling, Chris; Johnson, Jane; Kerridge, Ian; Wilson, Andrew; Ward, Michael; Stewart, Cameron; Gilbert, Gwendolyn","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c58e0eb436a3d0cb4c5acfa41babc03b3dfe825.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4696140.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2617-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26715066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Health approach","health researchers","public health responses","prevention of EIDs","modification of public values","effective EID control","analytic framework","EID events","EID threats","effective control","genuine public engagement processes","genuine reform","statement of principles","socio-political drivers","effectiveness of policies","inter-sectoral collaboration","inter-disciplinary co-operation","set of practical principles","transparency","education","human","understanding","dynamic nature","knowledge synthesis","critical analysis of scholarship","philosophical review","theory","ethics","alignment","contingent sets of relations","decision-making procedures","capture people\u2019s preferences","case experiences","animal","pathogens","infectious diseases","strong motivating rationale","practitioners","practice","risks of emerging","social science research","environmental interfaces","SUMMARY","legal challenges","focus","rhetoric","consequences","implementation","species barriers","perceived crisis","DISCUSSION","manner","development","integration","impact","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

They are associated with more days on mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased risk of mortality. Theoretically, interventions that prevent ventilator-associated events should also reduce associated morbidity. We evaluated the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program approach to improve the care of mechanically ventilated patients. Methods All mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU between October 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016, were prospectively monitored for the development of ventilator-associated events according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. A process care bundle (endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning, head-of-bed elevation \u226530\u00B0, target sedation scores, daily spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials), daily delirium assessment, and an early mobility protocol were instituted. The bundle compliance, ventilator-associated events rates, ICU length of stay, and mortality rate were noted. The database allowed viewing of current rates, trends, and averages of all participating sites. Results In the study period, 2,321 patients were admitted to the ICU, and 1,231 required mechanical ventilation (10,342 ventilator days). There were 115 ventilator-associated events: 82 ventilator-associated conditions, 15 infection-related ventilator-associated conditions, and 18 possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The ICU mortality rate was 13.3%, compared with 28.7% for those mechanically ventilated patients with ventilator-associated events (P = .0001). There was increased compliance for spontaneous awakening trials (51.5%-76.9%, P = .0008) and spontaneous breathing trials (54.2%-72.2%, P = .02) and a decrease in infection-related ventilator-associated conditions (4.2-3.5 per 1,000 days), possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.1-1.7 per 1,000 days), ICU mortality (45.3%-19.1%, P = .045), and ventilator-associated events associated mortality rates (33.3%-8.3%, P \u003C .37). Physical therapy participation and mobility were 60.8% and 26.4%, respectively. Conclusion The implementation of a multipronged program like the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program could improve the care processes and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Raymond M.; Al-Juaid, Maha; Al-Mutairi, Hanan; Bibin, George; Alchin, John; Matroud, Amal; Burrows, Victoria; Tan, Ismael; Zayer, Salha; Naidv, Brintha; Kalantan, Basim; Arabi, Yaseen M.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db2d0ec9034b70105da0c56b4681afe38cc63ac5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115308.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655318307405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30193800/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.06.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655318307405","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program","National Healthcare Safety Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ventilator-associated events rates","Background Ventilator-associated events","associated pneumonia","ventilator days","associated morbidity","infection-related ventilator-associated conditions","development of ventilator","possible cases of ventilator","ventilated patients","ICU mortality rate","mortality rates","spontaneous awakening trials","spontaneous breathing trials","ICU length of stay","intensive care unit","increased risk of mortality","care processes","Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program approach","process care bundle","multipronged program","bundle compliance","mechanical ventilation","increased compliance","viewing of current rates","National Healthcare Safety Network criteria","daily delirium assessment","early mobility protocol","endotracheal intubation","head","subglottic suctioning","target sedation scores","averages","trends","bed elevation","outcomes","decrease","Physical therapy participation","Conclusion","implementation","database","study period","interventions","participating sites","Results","Methods"],"language":"en"},

As no vaccines are available for human use, continuous effort is needed to develop effective and safe vaccines to prevent ZIKV infection. In this study, we constructed three recombinant proteins comprising, respectively, residues 296\u2013406 (E296-406), 298\u2013409 (E298-409), and 301\u2013404 (E301-404) of ZIKV envelope (E) protein domain III (EDIII) fused with a C-terminal Fc of human IgG. Our results demonstrated that E298-409 induced the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies against infection with nine ZIKV strains isolated from different hosts, countries, and time periods, and it maintained long-term anti-ZIKV immunogenicity to induce neutralizing antibodies. Pups born to mice immunized with E298-409 were fully protected against lethal challenge with two epidemic human ZIKV strains, 2015/Honduras (R103451) and 2015/Colombia (FLR). Passive transfer of anti-E298-409 mouse sera protected pups born to naive mice, as well as type I interferon receptor-deficient adult A129 mice, from lethal challenge with human ZIKV strains R103451 and FLR, and this protection was positively correlated with neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that the critical neutralizing fragment (i.e., a fragment that can induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies against divergent ZIKV strains) of ZIKV EDIII is a good candidate for development as an effective and safe ZIKV subunit vaccine to protect pregnant mothers and their fetuses against ZIKV infection. The E298-409-specific antibodies can be used for passive immunization to prevent ZIKV infection in newborns or immunocompromised adults.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tai, Wanbo; He, Lei; Wang, Yufei; Sun, Shihun; Zhao, Guangyu; Luo, Chuming; Li, Pei; Zhao, Haiyan; Fremont, Daved H.; Li, Fang; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcd9e38e06549c39625f00187d5b8f4a769b584f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5837162.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-017-0007-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29362446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","EDIII","ZIKV EDIII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV infection","ZIKV EDIII","ZIKV envelope","divergent ZIKV strains","human ZIKV strains R103451","epidemic human ZIKV strains","safe ZIKV subunit vaccine","long-term anti-ZIKV immunogenicity","potent neutralizing antibodies","highest titer of neutralizing antibodies","specific antibodies","critical neutralizing fragment","human use","Passive transfer of anti-E298","lethal challenge","naive mice","safe vaccines","Pups","FLR","C-terminal Fc of human IgG","passive immunization","Zika virus","interferon receptor-deficient adult A129 mice","congenital Zika syndrome","close association","pregnant mothers","type","mouse sera","development","different hosts","serious health threat","time periods","CZS","countries","continuous effort","protein domain","good candidate","newborns","microcephaly","immunocompromised adults","fetuses","protection","Honduras","residues","recombinant proteins","severe birth defects","data","study","Colombia","E301","E296","results"],"language":"en"},

We surveyed neurosurgeons worldwide to investigate the situation they are experiencing. Design and participants A 17-question, web-based survey was administered to neurosurgeons worldwide through the WFNS and the Neurosurgery Cocktail from March 28 to April 5, 2020 by web link or e-mail invitation. Questions were divided into three subgroups: general information, health system organization, and institutional plans for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Collected data was initially elaborated using Survey Monkey\u00AE software. Country specific data were extracted from the WHO website. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.6.3. Results Of the 446 respondents, most were from Italy (20%), India (19%), and Pakistan (5%). Surgical activity was significantly reduced in most centers (79%) and dedicated in-hospital routes were created for SARS-CoV-2 patients (58%). Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%). The preferred methods included a nasopharyngeal swab and chest x-ray. Health professionals were rarely screened (20%) and sometimes, even if SARS-CoV-2 positive, were asked to work if asymptomatic (26%). Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), while indications were modified for non-urgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%). Conclusions Most neurosurgeons worldwide reported work reorganization and practices that respond to current international guidelines. Differences in practice might be related to the perception of the pandemic and significant differences in the health systems. Sharing data and experiences will be of paramount importance to address the present moment and challenges in the near future.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fontanella, Marco M.; De Maria, Lucio; Zanin, Luca; Saraceno, Giorgio; Terzi di Bergamo, Lodovico; Servadei, Franco; Chaurasia, Bipin; Olivi, Alessandro; Vajkoczy, Peter; Schaller, Karl; Cappabianca, Paolo; Doglietto, Francesco","journal":"World Neurosurg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8016e0f59dd3ad4b66177941d1a833d93c9a12c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380337/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020309141; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020309141?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.04.204","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WFNS"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","neurosurgeons","pandemic","health systems","Health professionals","health system organization","web-based survey","Country specific data","significant differences","web link","Survey Monkey","medical practice","Surgical activity","Surgical planning","reported work reorganization","practices","institutional plans","present moment","nasopharyngeal swab","subgroups","general information","paramount importance","challenges","Conclusions","perception","Objective","preferred methods","chest x-ray","near future","Abstract Background","current international guidelines","Statistical analysis","R version","indications","non-urgent procedures","specialties","e-mail invitation","participants","WFNS","experiences","hospital routes","respondents","Italy","subarachnoid hemorrhages","contribution","Neurosurgery Cocktail","Design","institutions","software","outbreak","patients","Patient screening","Results","India","disease","centers","Questions","website","situation","Pakistan","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

Here, we showed that the expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in the liver and spleen was triggered by MHV-3.

Mechanistically, TNFR1 deficiency directly impeded the serum and tissue levels of fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), a virus-induced procoagulant molecule that promotes cell apoptosis. Additionally, the expression of apoptosis-associated molecules, Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) in the infected organs from TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice were also decreased. Moreover, the infiltration of neutrophils rather than Foxp3\u002B regulatory T cells, which produce proinflammatory factors and FGL2 directly, into the infected liver and spleen tissues was also decreased in TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice. These combined results indicate that signaling through TNFR1 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of FH caused by MHV-3 infection, and interruption of this signaling pathway could be useful for clinical therapy.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Huan; Li, Hong; Cao, Dayan; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78dd8f425161afb870d42750c84c831746997c7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126990.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247813001752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286726/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247813001752; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2013.11.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mice","expression of TNFR1","MHV","TNFR1 deficiency","cell apoptosis","pathogenesis of FH","infected liver","expression of apoptosis","pathogenesis of fulminant virus hepatitis","essential role","infected spleens","mediated FH","infected organs","infection","FGL2","murine hepatitis virus strain","Abstract TNF-\u03B1","Fas ligand","tissue necrosis","virus-induced procoagulant molecule","specific TNF-\u03B1 receptors","spleen tissues","tissue levels of fibrinogen","associated molecules","regulatory T cells","Foxp3","serum","FasL","dramatic decrease","livers","proinflammatory factors","wild type littermate controls","pathway","protein","TNFR2","prolonged survival","clinical therapy","infiltration of neutrophils","interruption","effect","disease","combined results"],"language":"en"},

Because of the need to protect long-lived poultry against respiratory tract pathogens from an early age, vaccination programs for pullets typically involve serial administration of a variety of vaccines, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Often the interval between vaccinations is only a matter of weeks, yet it is unknown whether the development of immunity and protection against challenge when vaccines are given in short succession occurs in these birds, something known as viral interference. Our objective was to determine whether serially administered, live attenuated vaccines against IBV, NDV, and ILTV influence the development and longevity of immunity and protection against challenge in long-lived birds. Based on a typical pullet vaccination program, specific-pathogen-free white leghorns were administered multiple live attenuated vaccines against IBV, NDV, and ILTV until 16 weeks of age (WOA), after which certain groups were challenged with IBV, NDV, or ILTV at 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 WOA. Five days post-challenge, viral load, clinical signs, ciliostasis, tracheal histopathology, and antibody titers in serum and tears were evaluated. We demonstrate that pullets serially administered live attenuated vaccines against IBV, NDV, and ILTV were protected against homologous challenge with IBV, NDV, or ILTV for at least 36 weeks, and conclude that the interval between vaccinations used in this study (at least 2 weeks) did not interfere with protection. This information is important because it shows that a typical pullet vaccination program consisting of serially administered live attenuated vaccines against multiple respiratory pathogens can result in the development of protective immunity against each disease agent.","publish_time":"2019-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aston, Emily J.; Jordan, Brian J.; Williams, Susan M.; Garc\u00EDa, Maricarmen; Jackwood, Mark W.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e192e65a6546583fe49086c4d3ac29a0620d5bd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6409539.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717342/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV","NDV","ILTV","multiple live attenuated vaccines","variety of vaccines","development of immunity","protection","weeks of age","homologous challenge","matter of weeks","multiple respiratory pathogens","Avian respiratory disease","Newcastle disease virus","development of protective immunity","typical pullet vaccination program","respiratory tract pathogens","vaccination programs","infectious bronchitis virus","days post-challenge","infectious laryngotracheitis virus","longevity of immunity","disease agent","pullets","long-lived birds","interval","vaccinations","WOA","early age","viral load","commercial poultry","viral interference","clinical signs","specific-pathogen","free white leghorns","ciliostasis","significant economic losses","tracheal histopathology","antibody titers","serial administration","serum","short succession","certain groups","tears","study","need","information","objective"],"language":"en"},

The mortality rates in the investigated flocks ranged from 1 to 47%. Results showed that mixed infection represented 66.3% of the examined flocks. Mixed infectious bronchitis (IBV) and avian influenza (AI)-H9N2 viruses were the most common infection (41.7%). Lack of AI-H9N2 vaccination and high rates of mixed infections in which AI-H9N2 is involved indicate an early AI-H9N2 infection with a potential immunosuppressive effect that predisposes for other viral infections. High pathogenic AI-H5N1 and virulent Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) infections were also detected (26.7% and 8.1%, respectively). Interestingly, co-infection of AI-H9N2 with either AIV-H5N1 or vNDV rarely resulted in high mortality. Partial cell-mediated immunity against similar internal AI genes, as well as virus interference between AI and vNDV, could be an explanation for this. Highly prevalent IBV and AI-H9N2 were isolated and were molecularly characterized based on S1 gene hypervariable region 3 (HVR3) and hemagglutinin gene (HA) sequences, respectively. IBV strains were related to the variant group of IBV with multiple mutations in HVR3. Though AI-H9N2 viruses showed low rate of evolution in comparison to recent strains, few amino acid substitutions indicative of antibody selection pressure were observed in the HA gene. In conclusion, mixed viral infections, especially with IBV and AI-H9N2 viruses, are the predominant etiology of respiratory disease problems in broiler chickens in Egypt. Further investigations of the role of AI, IBV, and ND viruses\u2019 co-infections and interference in terms of altering the severity of clinical signs and lesions and/or generating novel reassortants within each virus are needed.","publish_time":"2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassan, Kareem E.; Shany, Salama A.

Although a viral aetiological agent is estimated to be involved in up to 80% of cases, the majority of these agents have never been specifically identified. Since 2009, diagnostic and surveillance efforts for influenza virus have been applied worldwide. However, insufficient epidemiological information is available for the many other respiratory viruses that can cause Acute respiratory infections. METHODS: This study evaluated the presence of 14 non-influenza respiratory viruses in 872 pharyngeal exudate samples using RT-qPCR. All samples met the operational definition of a probable case of an influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory infection and had a previous negative result for influenza by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The presence of at least one non-influenza virus was observed in 312 samples (35.8%). The most frequent viruses were rhinovirus (RV; 33.0%), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; 30.8%) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV; 10.6%). A total of 56 cases of co-infection (17.9%) caused by 2, 3, or 4 viruses were identified. Approximately 62.5% of all positive cases were in children under 9 years of age. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified 13 non-influenza respiratory viruses that could occur in any season of the year. This study provides evidence for the prevalence and seasonality of a wide range of respiratory viruses that circulate in Mexico and constitute a risk for the population. Additionally, our data suggest that including these tests more widely in the diagnostic algorithm for influenza may reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics, reduce the hospitalisation time, and enrich national epidemiological data with respect to the infections caused by these viruses.","publish_time":"2017-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandes-Matano, Larissa; Monroy-Mu\u00F1oz, Irma Elo\u00EDsa; Angeles-Mart\u00EDnez, Javier; Sarquiz-Martinez, Brenda; Palomec-Nava, Iliana Donaj\u00ED; Pardav\u00E9-Alejandre, Hector Daniel; Santos Coy-Arechavaleta, Andrea; Santacruz-Tinoco, Clara Esperanza; Gonz\u00E1lez-Ibarra, Joaqu\u00EDn; Gonz\u00E1lez-Bonilla, Cesar Ra\u00FAl; Mu\u00F1oz-Medina, Jos\u00E9 Esteban","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cac8f96521f21bbd0a84861a98a5715d86b293f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5415110.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28467515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["non-influenza respiratory viruses","Acute respiratory infections","non-influenza virus","wide range of respiratory viruses","frequent viruses","severe acute respiratory infection","human respiratory syncytial virus","study","presence","RT-qPCR","cases of co-infection","positive cases","pharyngeal exudate samples","national epidemiological data","diagnostic algorithm","human metapneumovirus","leading cause of morbidity","insufficient epidemiological information","previous negative result","illness","hospitalisation time","prevalence","seasonality","HRSV","probable case","use of unnecessary antibiotics","children","operational definition","respect","surveillance efforts","mortality","evidence","tests","rhinovirus","total","Mexico","BACKGROUND","years of age","viral aetiological agent","risk","HMPV","majority","agents","METHODS","population","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This is attributed to the \u201C species barrier \u201C, a simplistic concept that in fact involves a series of conditions for successful inter-species transmission. These include access to an infectable surface, multiplication on that surface, colonisation, invasion, multiplication inside the new host, and resistance to innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Each of these steps requires a specific ligand-receptor interaction. The full series of events must be \u201C reprogrammed \u201C for efficient implantation in a new host.

It also allowed us to accurately determine the kinetic rate constants for the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. His-CypA was first captured on a Ni2\u002B\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip and was then briefly covalently stabilized, coupling via primary amines. The significant baseline drift observed due to dissociation of weakly bound His-CypA from the Ni2\u002B\u2013NTA moiety was eliminated, resulting in a surface that was stable for at least 36h. In addition, immobilized protein activity levels were high, typically between 85 and 95%, assayed by the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant for CsA (K dCsA) binding to the immobilized His-CypA was 23\u00B16nM, with on and off rates of 0.53\u00B10.1\u03BCM\u22121 s\u22121 and 1.2\u00B10.1 (\u00D710\u22122) s\u22121, respectively.

METHODS: Fecal consistency was assessed by gross examination. Fecal moisture was evaluated before and after lyophilization. Canine parvovirus and coronavirus were detected in feces by qPCR and qRT\u2010PCR respectively. Giardia intestinalis antigen was quantified by ELISA. The standard McMaster flotation technique was used to detect eggs and oocysts in feces. Fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations were quantified by in\u2010house radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: For each marker (IgA and calprotectin), a strong positive correlation was observed between concentration in fresh feces and concentration in fecal dry matter. 75.6% of the puppies were found to be infected by at \u22651 of the enteropathogens evaluated. Fecal calprotectin concentration was significantly influenced by age (P = .001), with higher concentrations in younger puppies, but not by viral (P = .863) or parasitic infection (P = .791).

With the purpose to overcome this challenge, herein a more advanced and practical sensing principle is developed with the OSD replaced by an amplifiable nucleic acid circuit, hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The very contagious norovirus (NoV) was employed as the model target. Compared with LAMP-OSD, the LAMP-HCR can detect as few as 30 copies of NoV gene in 2% fecal samples with significantly enlarged signal change and signal-to-background ratio. Therefore, more reliable detection is achieved. Moreover, due to the high compatibility of HCR, the final LAMP-HCR products can be flexibly transduced into different types of readouts, including fluorescence, flow cytometer (FCM) and even a personal glucose meter (PGM). This further enlarges the operating environments for the detection from hospital labs, bedsides, to potential off-the-shelf devices in local pharmacies.

Virus-induced cytoskeletal dynamics are thought to be closely related to this type of nerve damage. Currently, the regulation pattern of the actin cytoskeleton and its molecular mechanism remain unclear when PHEV enters the host cells. Here, we demonstrate that entry of PHEV into N2a cells induces a biphasic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and a dynamic change in cofilin activity. Viral entry is affected by the disruption of actin kinetics or alteration of cofilin activity. PHEV binds to integrin \u03B15\u03B21 and then initiates the integrin \u03B15\u03B21-FAK signaling pathway, leading to virus-induced early cofilin phosphorylation and F-actin polymerization. Additionally, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and downstream regulatory gene p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs) are recruited as downstream mediators of PHEV-induced dynamic changes of the cofilin activity pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PHEV utilizes the integrin \u03B15\u03B21-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK-cofilin pathway to cause an actin cytoskeletal rearrangement to promote its own invasion, providing theoretical support for the development of PHEV pathogenic mechanisms and new antiviral targets. IMPORTANCE PHEV, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a typical neurotropic virus that primarily affects the nervous system of piglets to produce typical neurological symptoms. However, the mechanism of nerve damage caused by the virus has not been fully elucidated. Actin is an important component of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells and serves as the first obstacle to the entry of pathogens into host cells. Additionally, the morphological structure and function of nerve cells depend on the dynamic regulation of the actin skeleton. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of neuronal injury induced by PHEV from the perspective of the actin cytoskeleton not only helps elucidate the pathogenesis of PHEV but also provides a theoretical basis for the search for new antiviral targets. This is the first report to define a mechanistic link between alterations in signaling from cytoskeleton pathways and the mechanism of PHEV invading nerve cells.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Xiaoling; Li, Zi; Guan, Jiyu; Hu, Shiyu; Zhang, Jing; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Lu, Huijun; Song, Deguang; He, Hongbin; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc5fa241fb3076e2cff1e121d6bd7566ae1c52eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6384086.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01736-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30541856/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/5/e01736-18.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanism of PHEV","entry of PHEV","actin cytoskeleton","IMPORTANCE PHEV","pathogenesis of PHEV","downstream mediators of PHEV","actin skeleton","cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells","host cells","cofilin activity pathway","actin cytoskeletal rearrangement","function of nerve cells","mechanism of nerve damage","development of PHEV pathogenic mechanisms","N2a cells","typical neurotropic virus","disruption of actin kinetics","F-actin polymerization","LIMK-cofilin pathway","cytoskeleton pathways","alteration of cofilin activity","integrin \u03B15\u03B21-FAK","type of nerve damage","dynamic regulation","neurological damage","molecular mechanism","early cofilin phosphorylation","mechanism of neuronal injury","Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","Rac1","dynamic changes","new antiviral targets","entry of pathogens","Viral entry","typical neurological symptoms","Cdc42-PAK","theoretical support","theoretical basis","regulation pattern","cytoskeletal dynamics","diffuse neuronal infection","Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate","regulatory gene p21-activated protein kinases","PAKs","biphasic remodeling","nervous system of piglets","search","Coronaviridae family","high mortality","cell division cycle","important component","invasion","alterations","member","morphological structure","perspective","mechanistic link","obstacle","report","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The complete genome sequence analysis showed that the CH/HNQX-3/14 possessed unique deletion regions in the S and ORF3 genes.

Further analyses of the full-length sequence suggest that CH/HNQX-3/14 is a natural recombinant between the attenuated vaccine strains (CV777 and DR13) and circulating wild-type strain (CH/ZMDZY/11). The recombination occurred not only in structural protein-coding region (S1 and N genes) but also in non-structural protein-coding region (replicases 1a and ORF3 genes).

In these studies we have found suspicious findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients. The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV2 infection. RESULTS: During the specified period, a total of 129 PET-CT studies were performed. Of these, 11 (8.5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process. These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62.2).

Previously, we showed that, in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged mice with allergic airway inflammation, rhinovirus (RV) infection increases type 2 cytokine production from alternatively-activated (M2) airway macrophages, enhancing eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. METHODS: Eight week-old wild type or IL-4 receptor knockout (IL-4R KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and inoculated with RV1B or sham HeLa cell lysate. RESULTS: In contrast to OVA-treated wild-type mice with both neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation, OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed increased neutrophilic inflammation with few eosinophils in the airways. Like wild-type mice, IL-4R KO mice showed OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity which was further exacerbated by RV. There was a shift in lung cytokines from a type 2-predominant response to a type 1 response, including production of IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03B1. IL-17A was also increased. RV infection of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice further increased neutrophilic inflammation. Bronchoalveolar macrophages showed an M1 polarization pattern and ex vivo RV infection increased macrophage production of TNF-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-12p40. Finally, lung cells from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed reduced CD206\u002B CD301\u002B M2 macrophages, decreased IL-13 and increased TNF-\u03B1 and IL-17A production by F4/80\u002B, CD11b\u002B macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice show neutrophilic airway inflammation constituting a model of allergic, type 1 cytokine-driven neutrophilic asthma. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling, RV infection of OVA-treated mice increased type 1 cytokine and IL-17A production from conventionally-activated macrophages, augmenting neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. In mice with allergic airways inflammation, IL-4R signaling determines macrophage activation state and the response to subsequent RV infection.","publish_time":"2014-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Jun Young; Chung, Yutein; Steenrod, Jessica; Chen, Qiang; Lei, Jing; Comstock, Adam T; Goldsmith, Adam M; Bentley, J Kelley; Sajjan, Uma S; Hershenson, Marc B","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c12642f0762cb4888b417ce295044080ab9202a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4066837.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-15-63; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of IL","OVA-treated IL","IL-12p40","treated mice","decreased IL","absence of IL","R KO mice","wild-type mice","RV infection of OVA","increased neutrophilic inflammation","neutrophilic airway inflammation","allergic airway inflammation","eosinophilic inflammation","eosinophilic airway inflammation","allergic airways inflammation","airway macrophages","OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity","pattern of RV","subsequent RV infection","week-old wild type","cytokine production","neutrophilic asthma","increased TNF-\u03B1","macrophage production of TNF","M2 macrophages","activated macrophages","allergic airways disease","Bronchoalveolar macrophages","model of allergic","airways hyperresponsiveness","state of macrophage activation","macrophage activation state","predominant response","induced exacerbation","lung cytokines","lung cells","asthma exacerbations","M1 polarization pattern","CD301","reduced CD206","rhinovirus","receptor knockout","IFN-\u03B3","RV1B","sham HeLa cell lysate","mechanisms","viruses","eosinophils","shift","METHODS","contrast","F4","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","CD11b","RESULTS","hypothesis","paper","ovalbumin"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 872 diarrheic fecal samples from pigs of different ages were collected from 12 districts of Sichuan Province in the southwest of China. RT-PCR was done with PToV S gene specific primers to detect the presence of PToV positive samples. M gene specific primers were used with the PToV positive samples and the genes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the M gene nucleotide sequences from the 19 selected novel Sichuan strains and 21 PToV and BToV M gene sequences from GenBank. RESULTS: A total of 331 (37.96%, 331/872) samples were found to be positive for PToV and the highest prevalence was observed in piglets aged from 1 to 3 weeks old. Through phylogenetic inference the 40 PToV M gene containing sequences were placed into two genotypes (I \u0026 II). The 19 novel Sichuan strains of genotype I showed strong correlations to two Korean gene sequences (GU-07-56-11 and GU-07-56-22).

PKR activity is regulated by a 58 kilo Dalton cellular inhibitor (P58(IPK)), which is present in inactive state as a complex with Hsp40 under normal conditions. In case of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, P58(IPK) is known to dissociate from Hsp40 and inhibit PKR activation. However the influenza virus component responsible for PKR inhibition through P58(IPK) activation was hitherto unknown. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human heat shock 40 protein (Hsp40) was identified as an interacting partner of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (IAV NP) using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies from mammalian cells transfected with IAV NP expressing plasmid. Further, the IAV NP-Hsp40 interaction was validated in mammalian cells infected with various seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Cellular localization studies showed that NP and Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus. During IAV infection in mammalian cells, expression of NP coincided with the dissociation of P58(IPK) from Hsp40 and decrease PKR phosphorylation. We observed that, plasmid based expression of NP in mammalian cells leads to decrease in PKR phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of NP expression during influenza virus replication led to PKR activation and concomitant increase in eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of NP expression also led to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation, enhanced IFN \u03B2 production and concomitant reduction of virus replication. Taken together our data suggest that NP is the viral factor responsible for P58(IPK) activation and subsequent inhibition of PKR-mediated host response during IAV infection. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate a novel role of IAV NP in inhibiting PKR-mediated anti-viral host response and help us understand P58(IPK) mediated inhibition of PKR activity during IAV infection.","publish_time":"2011-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Kulbhushan; Tripathi, Shashank; Ranjan, Priya; Kumar, Purnima; Garten, Rebecca; Deyde, Varough; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Cox, Nancy J.; Lal, Renu B.; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Lal, Sunil K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93b3fcce1e0a7c9a82091bd832b1b3a286133679.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3115951.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21698289/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020215","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dalton"],"organizations":["NP","IAV NP","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PKR inhibition","PKR activation","PKR phosphorylation","expression of NP","IAV NP-Hsp40 interaction","inhibition of NP expression","IPK","IAV infection","inhibition of PKR activity","inhibiting PKR","subsequent inhibition of PKR","mammalian cells","novel role of IAV NP","influenza virus replication","Hsp40 co-","dissociation of P58","influenza virus component responsible","virus nucleoprotein","case of influenza","mediated host response","anti-viral host response","concomitant reduction of virus replication","eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","interacting partner of Influenza","anti-viral innate immune response","viral factor responsible","pandemic strains of influenza viruses","reduced IRF3 phosphorylation","plasmid","co-immunoprecipitation studies","Cellular localization studies","concomitant increase","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Dalton cellular inhibitor","Double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase","enhanced IFN \u03B2 production","complex","Human heat shock","key regulator","BACKGROUND","inactive state","yeast","normal conditions","hybrid screen","SIGNIFICANCE","nucleus","data"],"language":"en"},

In today\u2019s world, dogs are an integral part of our communities as well as dogs breeding and rearing has become a lucrative business. Therefore, a fast, accurate, portable, and cost-effective CPV-2 detection method with the ability for on-site detection is highly desired. In this study, we for the first time proposed a nanosystem for CPV-2 DNA detection with RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a, which upon activation results in collateral RNA degradation. We expressed LwCas13a in prokaryotic expression system and purified it through nickel column. Activity of Cas13a was verified by RNA-bound fluorescent group while using a quenched fluorescent probe as signals. Further Cas13a was combined with Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and T7 transcription to establish molecular detection system termed specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter un-locking (SHERLOCK) for sensitive detection of CPV-2 DNA. This nanosystem can detect 100 amol/L CPV-2 DNA within 30 min. The proposed nanosystem exhibited high specificity when tested for CPV-2 and other dog viruses. This CRISPR-Cas13a mediated sensitive detection approach can be of formidable advantage during CPV-2 outbreaks because it is time-efficient, less laborious and does not involve the use of sophisticated instruments.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Haroon; Khan, Adeel; Liu, Yufeng; Wang, Su; Bibi, Sumaira; Xu, Hongpan; Liu, Yuan; Durrani, Samran; Jin, Lian; He, Nongyue; Xiong, Tao","journal":"Chin Chem Lett","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129497.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001841719306369; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001841719306369; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cclet.2019.10.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288403/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitive detection of CPV","DNA detection","cost-effective CPV","detection method","on-site detection","molecular detection system","sensitive detection approach","RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a","CRISPR-Cas13a","Activity of Cas13a","proposed nanosystem","collateral RNA degradation","lethal disease of dogs","high specificity","fluorescent group","time-efficient","prokaryotic expression system","quenched fluorescent probe","specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter un-locking","SHERLOCK","T7 transcription","activation results","formidable advantage","RPA","higher mortality","Recombinase polymerase amplification","outbreaks","ability","LwCas13a","signals","rearing","today\u2019s world","puppies","Canine parvovirus type","infection","amol","nickel column","use of sophisticated instruments","lucrative business","communities","dog viruses","study"],"language":"en"},

The use of appropriate surveillance systems ensures timely information management for effective planning and response to infectious diseases threats during the pilgrimage. The literature describes infectious diseases prevention and control strategies for Hajj but with limited information on the operations and characteristics of the existing Hajj infectious diseases surveillance systems. Method: We reviewed documents, including guidelines and reports from the Saudi Ministry of Health\u2019s database, to describe the characteristics of the infectious diseases surveillance systems that were operational during the 2015 Hajj, highlighting best practices and gaps and proposing strategies for strengthening and improvement. Using Pubmed and Embase online search engines and a combination of search terms including, \u2018mass gatherings\u2019 \u2018Olympics\u2019 \u2018surveillance\u2019 \u2018Hajj\u2019 \u2018health security\u2019, we explored the existing literature and highlighted some lessons learnt from other international mass gatherings. Results: A regular indicator-based infectious disease surveillance system generates routine reports from health facilities within the Kingdom to the regional and central public health directorates all year round. During Hajj, enhanced indicator-based notifiable diseases surveillance systems complement the existing surveillance tool to ensure timely reporting of event information for appropriate action by public health officials. Conclusion: There is need to integrate the existing Hajj surveillance data management systems and to implement syndromic surveillance as an early warning system for infectious disease control during Hajj. International engagement is important to strengthen Hajj infectious diseases surveillance and to prevent disease transmission and globalization of infectious agents which could undermine global health security.","publish_time":"2017-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alotaibi, Badriah M.; Yezli, Saber; Bin Saeed, Abdul-Aziz A.; Turkestani, Abdulhafeez; Alawam, Amnah H.; Bieh, Kingsley L.","journal":"J Travel Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb6b040c9c3c96b330a5d83430081864bd2cb390.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28355612/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taw087","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Saudi Ministry"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["existing Hajj infectious diseases surveillance systems","infectious disease surveillance system","syndromic surveillance","notifiable diseases surveillance systems","existing Hajj surveillance data management systems","existing surveillance tool","infectious diseases prevention","infectious diseases threats","use of appropriate surveillance systems","infectious disease control","globalization of infectious agents","health facilities","existing literature","public health officials","global health security","timely information management","international mass gatherings","central public health directorates","limited information","disease transmission","characteristics","control strategies","mass gatherings\u2019","diverse mass gatherings","timely reporting of event information","appropriate action","routine reports","regular indicator","enhanced indicator","International engagement","early warning system","combination of search terms","Embase online search engines","effective planning","response","Kingdom","lessons","Saudi Ministry of Health\u2019s database","operations","guidelines","Pubmed","year","best practices","gaps","Olympics\u2019","documents","pilgrimage","Results","Method","improvement","Background","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies, the higher is the chance of mutation occurring. The effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies. The amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations, whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations.

Moreover, the risk of zoonosis has probably been underestimated in occupational settings. A literature review between 2007 and 2018 was performed to identify evidences concerning the epidemiological associations between some emerging viruses and occupational diseases. Observational studies and case-reports were selected and analyzed. West Nile Virus (WNV) disease, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) disease and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection were included in the review for their potential zoonotic transmission. The most important risk factor for acquiring WNV infection and CCHF infection is the exposure to infected mosquitoes and ticks, respectively; therefore, outdoor workers are at risk of infection. HEV is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, that can become infected through waterborne, foodborne and zoonotic transmission routes. A total of 10, 34 and 45 eligible studies for WNV, CCHF virus (CCFHV) and HEV, respectively, were analyzed by year, country, study design, risk group and outcomes.

This study aims to evaluate the association of the TyG index with the severity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The study included a cohort of 151 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan. Regression models were used to investigate the association between TyG with severity and mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: In this cohort, 39 (25.8%) patients had diabetes, 62 (41.1%) patients were severe cases, while 33 (22.0%) patients died in hospital. The TyG index levels were significantly higher in the severe cases and death group (mild vs. severe 8.7 \u00B1 0.6 vs. 9.2 \u00B1 0.6, P \u003C 0.001; survivor vs. deceased 8.8 \u00B1 0.6 vs. 9.3 \u00B1 0.7, P \u003C 0.001), respectively. The TyG index was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe case and mortality, after controlling for potential confounders (OR for severe case, 2.9, 95% CI 1.2\u20136.3, P = 0.007; OR for mortality, 2.9, 95% CI 1.2\u20136.7, P = 0.016). The associations were not statistically significant for further adjustment of inflammatory factors. CONCLUSION: TyG index was closely associated with the severity and morbidity in COVID-19 patients, thus it may be a valuable marker for identifying poor outcome of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Huihui; Yang, Yan; Wang, Fen; Yan, Yongli; Shi, Xiaoli; Dong, Kun; Yu, Xuefeng; Zhang, Shujun","journal":"Cardiovasc Diabetol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cccb9e977130f77640bd697e2549acedf1a5239.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213552.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393351/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-020-01035-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","mortality of COVID","TyG index levels","severe cases","severity","glucose index","poor outcome of COVID","increased risk of severe case","mortality of coronavirus disease","cohort","study","valuable marker","tertiary teaching hospital","marker of insulin resistance","death group","triglyceride","potential confounders","adjustment of inflammatory factors","Wuhan","BACKGROUND","morbidity","survivor","deceased","METHODS","CONCLUSION","Regression models","associations","RESULTS","diabetes"],"language":"en"},

To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions.

Authors from Thailand, China mainland, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Malaysia present their analyses in three parts. The first part of the article describes the data-collection process and the sources of data. The second part of the article presents issues around policies of data sharing with the stakeholders. The third and final part of the article focuses on the extent of health-care data use for policy reform in these different economies. Even though these economies differ in their economic structure and population size, they share some similarities on issues related to health-care data. There are two main institutions that collect and manage the health-care data in these economies. In Thailand, China mainland, Taiwan, and Malaysia, the Ministry of Health is responsible through its various agencies for collecting and managing the health-care data. On the other hand, health insurance is the main institution that collects and stores health-care data in South Korea and Japan. In all economies, sharing of and access to data is an issue. The reasons for limited access to some data are privacy protection, fragmented health-care system, poor quality of routinely collected data, unclear policies and procedures to access the data, and control on the freedom on publication. The primary objective of collecting health-care data in these economies is to aid the policymakers and researchers in policy decision making as well as create an awareness on health-care issues for the general public. The usage of data in monitoring the performance of the heath system is still in the process of development. In conclusion, for the region under discussion, health-care data collection is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and health insurance agencies. Data are collected from health-care providers mainly from the public sector. Routinely collected data are supplemented by national surveys.

Among the MAPK family, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is known to be modulated during the infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); however, involvement of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) comprising p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) remains to be determined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether activation of p38 MAPK and JNK cascades is required for PEDV replication. Our results showed that PEDV activates p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 up to 24h post-infection, whereas, thereafter their phosphorylation levels recede to baseline levels or even fall below them. Notably, UV-irradiated inactivated PEDV, which can enter cells but cannot replicate inside them, failed to induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 suggesting that viral biosynthesis is essential for activation of these kinases. Treatment of cells with selective p38 or JNK inhibitors markedly impaired PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner and these antiviral effects were found to be maximal during the early times of the infection. Furthermore, direct pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or JNK1/2 activation resulted in a significant reduction of viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny release. However, independent treatments with either SAPK inhibitor did not inhibit PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death mediated by activation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) suggesting that SAPKs are irrelevant to the apoptosis pathway during PEDV infection. In summary, our data demonstrated critical roles of the p38 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways in facilitating successful viral infection during the post-entry steps of the PEDV life cycle.","publish_time":"2016-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Changhee; Kim, Youngnam; Jeon, Ji Hyun","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3983a3d009096ec06c7b4571447bd3e137ca38c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114560.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216301514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27215486/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216301514","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK","JNK","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","activation of p38 MAPK","phosphorylation of p38 MAPK","inactivated PEDV","selective p38","impaired PEDV replication","JNK1","MAPK family","direct pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK","successful viral infection","PEDV life cycle","viral protein expression","h post-infection","viral biosynthesis","activation of mitochondrial apoptosis","activated protein kinases","mitogen-activated protein kinase","SAPKs","pathways","JNK inhibitors","JNK cascades","apoptosis pathway","phosphorylation levels","NH2-terminal kinase","significant reduction of viral RNA synthesis","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","Treatment of cells","post-entry steps","dose-dependent manner","central building blocks","AIF","ERK","factor","critical roles","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","apoptotic cell death","involvement of stress","antiviral effects","network","data","SAPK inhibitor","progeny release","independent treatments","summary","viruses of diverse families","early times","results","present study","UV"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA vaccines were constructed to express Ebola virus GP. Mice were injected with GP DNA vaccines and their splenocytes were used for hybridoma production. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), limiting dilution subcloning, antibody purification methods, and Western blot assays were used to select GP-specific hybridomas and purify monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from the hybridoma cells. RESULTS: Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity, were selected by ELISA. When purified MAbs from 12 hybridomas were tested for their reactivity to GP, 11 MAbs, except for 1 MAb (from the A6-9 hybridoma) displaying an IgG2a type, were identified as IgM isotypes. Those 11 MAbs failed to recognize GP. However, the MAb from A6-9 recognized the mucin-like region of GP and remained reactive to the antigen at the lowest tested concentration (1.95 ng/mL). This result suggests that IgM-secreting hybridomas are predominantly generated by DNA vaccination. However, boosting with GP resulted in greater production of IgG-secreting hybridomas than GP DNA vaccination alone. CONCLUSION: DNA vaccination may preferentially generate IgM-secreting hybridomas, but boosting with the protein antigen can reverse this propensity. Thus, this protein boosting approach may have implications for the production of IgG-specific hybridomas in the context of the DNA vaccination platform. In addition, the purified monoclonal IgG antibodies may be useful as therapeutic antibodies for controlling Ebola virus infection.","publish_time":"2017-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Si-Hyeong; Han, Baek-Sang; Choe, Jongseon; Sin, Jeong-Im","journal":"Clin Exp Vaccine Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/839df627ece5b5fc7bb1ce3b4f96127677fd0494.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5540962.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2017.6.2.135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28775978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of GP","GP-specific hybridomas","GP DNA vaccination","GP DNA vaccines","region of GP","IgM-secreting hybridomas","express Ebola virus GP","GP-binding activity","DNA vaccination platform","MAbs","utility of DNA vaccines","hybridoma production","monoclonal antibodies","purified monoclonal IgG antibodies","greater production of IgG","therapeutic antibodies","Ebola virus glycoprotein","Ebola virus infection","protein antigen","IgM isotypes","hybridoma cells","A6","vaccine type","IgG2a type","antibody purification methods","Western blot assays","lowest tested concentration","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","ELISAs","context","dilution subcloning","splenocytes","implications","addition","cell supernatants","study","approach","mucin","MATERIALS","Mice","reactivity","PURPOSE","goal","propensity","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Specific aspects include the consequences of genome segmentation for RLR activation and a discussion on the physiological ligands of RLRs.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weber, Michaela; Weber, Friedemann","journal":"Cytokine \u0026 Growth Factor Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d8e00c5a89762c9bc6cd0f020715ff36b1163bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108359.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2014.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S135961011400046X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894317/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135961011400046X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RLR signalling","RLR activation","RLR agonists","nonsegmented genome","wide variety of countermeasures ns-NSVs","consequences of genome segmentation","cytoplasmic RNA helicases","recognizing virus-specific RNA structures","signalling cascade","Specific aspects","termed RIG","Abstract Negative strand RNA viruses","physiological ligands of RLRs","discussion","views","production","important source of human","animal diseases","current knowledge","MDA5","receptors","host","infections","innate immune responses","antiviral type","interferons","Survival"],"language":"en"},

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R(0) of 1\u00B75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R(0) was 2\u00B75 or 3\u00B75 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R(0) of 1\u00B75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R(0) of 2\u00B75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R(0) of 3\u00B75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R(0) was 1\u00B75. For R(0) values of 2\u00B75 or 3\u00B75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

Here, we report the unexpected identification of leaderless genomes, in addition to leader-containing genomes, in a cell culture persistently infected with BCoV. The discovery was made by using a head-to-tail ligation method that examines genomic 5\u2032-terminal sequences at different times postinfection. Functional analyses of the leaderless genomic RNA in a BCoV defective interfering (DI) RNA revealed that (1) the leaderless genome was able to serve as a template for the synthesis of negative-strand genome, although it cannot perform replicative positive-strand genomic RNA synthesis, and (2) the leaderless genome retained its function in translation and transcription, although the efficiency of these processes was impaired. Therefore, this previously unidentified leaderless genome is associated with the attenuation of genome expression.

National guidelines currently recommend 12-14 in-person prenatal visits, a schedule unchanged since 1930. In scrutinizing the standard prenatal visit schedule, it quickly becomes clear that prenatal care is overdue for a redesign. We have strong evidence of the benefit of many prenatal services, like screening for gestational diabetes and maternal vaccination. Yet how to deliver these services is much less clear. Studies of prenatal services consistently demonstrate such care can be delivered in fewer than 14 visits, and that we do not need to provide all maternity services in person. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising care delivery option for patients seeking greater flexibility, and early trials leveraging virtual care and remote monitoring have shown positive maternal and fetal outcomes with high patient satisfaction. Our institution has worked for the past year on a new prenatal care pathway. Our initial work assessed the literature, elicited patient perspectives, and captured the insights of experts in patient-centered care delivery. Two key principles emerged to inform prenatal care redesign: 1) design care delivery around essential services, using in-person care for services that cannot be delivered remotely and offering video visits for other essential services; and 2) create flexible services for anticipatory guidance and psychosocial support that allow patients to tailor support to meet their needs through opt-in programs. The rise of COVID-19 prompted us to extend this early work and rapidly implement a redesigned prenatal care pathway. In this paper, we outline our experience rapidly transitioning prenatal care to a new model with 4 in-person visits, 1 ultrasound visit, and 4 virtual visits (the 4-1-4 prenatal plan). We then explore how lessons from this implementation can inform patient-centered prenatal care redesign during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peahl, Alex F.; Smith, Roger D.; Moniz, Michelle H.","journal":"American journal of obstetrics and gynecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19e4fa1af4ad625fa185c6a27a2eb650f3c94eb8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425200/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820305561; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305561?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Telemedicine"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["prenatal care redesign","person care","virtual care","new prenatal care pathway","redesigned prenatal care pathway","Studies of prenatal services","person prenatal visits","prenatal plan","design care delivery","patient-centered care delivery","essential services","promising care delivery option","flexible services","maternity services","person visits","standard prenatal visit schedule","virtual visits","video visits","high patient satisfaction","elicited patient perspectives","pregnant patients","early work","fetal outcomes","early trials","psychosocial support","maternal vaccination","ultrasound visit","new model","past year","schedule unchanged","initial work","rise of COVID","remote monitoring","greater flexibility","screening","crucial preventive service","anticipatory guidance","gestational diabetes","United States","literature","insights of experts","moms","benefit","key principles","needs","implementation","experience","opt-in programs","strong evidence","babies","institution","lessons","Telemedicine","fewer","National guidelines","paper","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. Methods The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects\u2019 conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was tested on simulated EHR databases generated from microbiology laboratory data. Results A requirements list that a syndromic and disease surveillance system should meet, and an open source system, \u201CThe Snow Agent system\u201D, has been developed. The Snow Agent system is a distributed system for monitoring the status of a population\u0027s health by distributing processes to, and extracting epidemiological data directly from, the electronic health records (EHR) system in a geographic area. Conclusions Syndromic and disease surveillance tools should be able to operate at all levels in the health systems and across national borders. Such systems should avoid transferring patient identifiable data, support two-way communications and be able to define and incorporate new and unknown diseases and syndrome definitions that should be reported by the system. The initial tests of the Snow Agent system shows that it will easily scale to national level in Norway.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bellika, Johan Gustav; Hasvold, Toralf; Hartvigsen, Gunnar","journal":"International Journal of Medical Informatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1007a3041cb5ae9e3e6f09712d81277c02ed3dbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108256.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386505606000463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505606000463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","EHR"],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["system specification","distributed system","Snow Agent system","disease surveillance systems","open source system","disease surveillance tools","communicable disease","health systems","analysis of disease outbreaks","Conclusions Syndromic","requirements list","epidemiology systems","patient-identifiable information","patient identifiable data","literature study of syndromic","epidemiological data","population\u0027s health","centralised storage of information","microbiology laboratory data","electronic health records","phases of analysis","Abstract Purpose","national borders","national level","simulated EHR databases","earlier projects\u2019 conclusions","individual patients","design","events","two-way communications","anthrax","unknown diseases","syndrome definitions","engineering paradigm","implementation","processes","status","deliberate spread of Bacillus anthracis","initial tests","input","construction","geographic area","diffusion","levels","specifications","SARS outbreak","testing","Norway","important goal","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Pathogen removal by aquatic plants mainly occurs because of toxicity exerted by exudates produced by them or attachment of pathogens to plant roots followed by filtration.

While the anti-microbiological properties of nitric oxide-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) such as peroxynitrite, are known, the mechanism of these effects are as yet poorly studied. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, was first identified during 2002-2003. Mortality in SARS patients ranges from between 6 to 55%. We have previously shown that nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in vitro by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanism of the inhibition process of nitric oxide against SARS-CoV. We found that peroxynitrite, an intermediate product of nitric oxide in solution formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide, has no effect on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, suggesting that the inhibition is either directly effected by NO or a derivative other than peroxynitrite. Most interestingly, we found that NO inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV by two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in the palmitoylation of nascently expressed spike (S) protein which affects the fusion between the S protein and its cognate receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Secondly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in viral RNA production in the early steps of viral replication, and this could possibly be due to an effect on one or both of the cysteine proteases encoded in Orf1a of SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2009-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C5kerstr\u00F6m, Sara; Gunalan, Vithiagaran; Keng, Choong Tat; Tan, Yee-Joo; Mirazimi, Ali","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111989.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19800091/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209005558; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209005558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","replication of SARS","replication cycle of SARS","Orf1a of SARS","SARS patients","Abstract Nitric oxide","inhibition process of nitric oxide","intermediate product of nitric oxide","peroxynitrite","S protein","early steps of viral replication","reduction","derivatives","unknown mechanism","anti-microbiological properties of nitric oxide-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates","viral RNA production","broad range of biological process","neurotransmission","important molecule","palmitoylation of nascently expressed spike","key role","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","vasodilatation","RNI","cognate receptor","solution","angiotensin","fusion","immune responses","enzyme","reaction","cysteine proteases","distinct mechanisms","superoxide","family Coronaviridae","Mortality","effects","study"],"language":"en"},

This coronavirus has been widely distributed among laboratories and has been passaged both within pigs and in cell culture. To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome (ca. 28kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different full genome sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession number AF353511) but they are \u003E99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest proportion of variability including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more dramatically affected in three different variants of this virus through either loss of the initiation codon or gain of a premature termination codon. The genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5\u00B4-terminal sequence. This rearrangement was validated through the analysis of sub-genomic mRNAs from infected cells.

Now, a new form of vaccine was introduced which will have the power to mask the risk side of conventional vaccines. This type of vaccine was produced from plants which are genetically modified. In the production of edible vaccines, the gene-encoding bacterial or viral disease-causing agent can be incorporated in plants without losing its immunogenic property. The main mechanism of action of edible vaccines is to activate the systemic and mucosal immunity responses against a foreign disease-causing organism. Edible vaccines can be produced by incorporating transgene in to the selected plant cell. At present edible vaccine are developed for veterinary and human use. But the main challenge faced by edible vaccine is its acceptance by the population so that it is necessary to make aware the society about its use and benefits. When compared to other traditional vaccines, edible vaccines are cost effective, efficient and safe. It promises a better prevention option from diseases.","publish_time":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurup, Vrinda M; Thomas, Jaya","journal":"Mol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30e0d37ac4b4360802b1c717c0ad52de23be7609.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090473.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12033-019-00222-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31758488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of edible vaccines","traditional vaccines","conventional vaccines","present edible vaccine","type of vaccine","new form of vaccine","disease-causing microorganism","plants","foreign disease-causing organism","viral disease-causing agent","particular diseases","main challenge","human use","mucosal immunity responses","main mechanism of action","important innovation","biological preparations","body\u2019s immune system","society","transgene","agents","selected plant cell","century research","antigen","better prevention option","population","risk","acceptance","forms","microbe","immunogenic property","benefits","protein","power"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of 19 respiratory pathogens in children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections during the winter influenza seasons of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and to observe a possible impact of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 on the epidemiology of other epidemic viruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens were nasopharyngeal aspirates which had been collected from children admitted to the participating hospitals in the area of Mainz, Wiesbaden, and Kiel, Germany, with acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. The specimens were subjected to a previously described multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay to detect the following microorganisms: enterovirus, influenza virus types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1\u20134, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus OC43 and 229E, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Legionella pneumophila. RESULTS: A total of 3,998 clinical specimens were collected from July 2009 to March 2011, of which 296 were positive for A(H1N1)pdm09. An epidemic of seasonal influenza A or B was not observed in the 2009/2010 season, but a minor epidemic of seasonal influenza B was observed in January/February 2011. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 coincided with the absence of the seasonal influenza A of former years. The RSV and hMPV epidemics of 2009/2010 erupted several weeks later than expected based on data collected in the PID-ARI-Network during the past 10 years, whereas in the 2010/2011 influenza season they occurred as expected. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of the novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus may have been influenced the epidemiology of other epidemic viruses, such as the RSV and hMPV. No epidemic of seasonal influenza was observed in the 2009/2010 influenza season.","publish_time":"2013-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gr\u00F6ndahl, B.; Ankermann, T.; von Bismarck, P.; Rockahr, S.; Kowalzik, F.; Gehring, S.; Meyer, C.; Knuf, M.; Puppe, W.","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df20a73159e55ae46b3da5c412482552ba43eb3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100052.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-013-0545-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel influenza","H1N1","influenza virus types","minor epidemic of seasonal influenza B","pdm09 virus","winter influenza seasons","possible impact of influenza","epidemic viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","RSV","lower respiratory tract infections","respiratory pathogens","children","Germany","epidemiology","hMPV epidemics","years","clinical specimens","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Bordetella parapertussis","Bordetella pertussis","parainfluenzavirus types","novel pandemic","rhinovirus","following microorganisms","human metapneumovirus","acute community","adenovirus","coronavirus OC43","multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay","Kiel","outbreak","enterovirus","area of Mainz","Network","Wiesbaden","participating hospitals","METHODS","nasopharyngeal aspirates","prevalence","absence","PID-ARI","Legionella pneumophila","wave of high activity","data","total","weeks","MATERIALS","emergence","study","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","aim"],"language":"en"},

This article, therefore, describes an approach to measuring the public temper, examining particularly the public temper of an Arab society, namely Saudi Arabia. It addresses the following research question: is it possible to analyse existing (scholarly) rumours to see if they can be used as informants of the public temper of the culture in which they exist? This question is answered ethnographically by analysing 579 Arabic online rumours collected by students as part of their critical engagement with educational technology. Having analysed the data, four categories emerged: the concerns, interests, attitudes and values of Saudi Arabia. According to the literature, these four categories, taken together, constitute the emotional domain (i.e., the public temper) of a society. Thus, a theoretical proposition (and contribution to the existing literature regarding sociology) is that rumours mirror the public temper of a culture, reflecting a range of emotions from simple to complex (from concerns, interests and attitudes to values). Simpler emotions (e.g., concerns) appear to be more easily affected by rumours than more complex emotions (e.g., values). An implication of this study is that rumours have \u2018biographies\u2019, which detail public tempers across space and time. Rumours are \u2018records\u2019 of public tempers that should be read in the same way archaeologists read landscapes and remains. Although rumours entail ill-defined information, it is feasible to well define society through such ill-defined information, meaning that something can come out of its opposite. This study offers ethnographers a new method of understanding public tempers through rumours, alongside conventional meaning-making symbols (e.g., poems).","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al Lily, Abdulrahman Essa; Elayyan, Shaher R.; Alhazmi, Ahmed Ali; Alzahrani, Saleh","journal":"Palgrave Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b5ea19f70cc6423edd78acce46bd49d0e86e8f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096947.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226632/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-018-0197-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["power of rumours","records\u2019 of public tempers","Arabic online rumours","concerns","complex emotions","values of Saudi Arabia","interests","attitudes","Arab society","study","existing literature","culture","range of emotions","Simpler emotions","ill-defined information","categories","conventional meaning","following research question","new method","contribution","students","critical engagement","ethnographers","sociology","biographies\u2019","educational technology","symbols","space","time","approach","theoretical proposition","emotional domain","way archaeologists","landscapes","implication","informants","poems","article","data","opposite"],"language":"en"},

Within clinical metagenomics, identifying microorganisms from a complex and host enriched background remains a central computational challenge. As proof of principle, we sequenced two metagenomic samples, a known viral mixture of 25 human pathogens and an unknown complex biological model using benchtop technology. The datasets were then analysed using a bioinformatic pipeline developed around recent fast classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 of the viruses against a background of host contamination from multiple sources and bacterial contamination. An alternative untargeted identification method was highly correlated with these classifications, and over 1,600 species were identified when applied to the complex biological model, including several species captured at over 50% genome coverage. In summary, this study demonstrates the great potential of applying metagenomics within the clinical laboratory setting and that this can be achieved using infrastructure available to nondedicated sequencing centres.","publish_time":"2015-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rose, Graham; Wooldridge, David J.; Anscombe, Catherine; Mee, Edward T.; Misra, Raju V.; Gharbia, Saheer","journal":"Int J Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daeba3efafc5b3f9e71e38069aadf1e0178bac9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4584244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26451363/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/292950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["background of host contamination","genome sequencing","unknown complex biological model","clinical metagenomics","species","host enriched background","great promise","great potential","bacterial contamination","Availability of fast","genome coverage","clinical laboratory","public health microbiology","nondedicated sequencing centres","recent fast classification methods","human pathogens","low cost","high throughput","known viral mixture","role","applications","multiple sources","outbreak detection","tracking transmission events","metagenomic samples","bioinformatic pipeline","benchtop technology","microorganisms","central computational challenge","microbial communities","infrastructure available","viruses","alternative untargeted identification method","study","disease","targeted approach","proof of principle","classifications","summary","datasets"],"language":"en"},

The majority of papers reporting on antiviral prescription found that a positive POCT result significantly increased use of antivirals for influenza compared with negative POCT results and standard supportive care. A positive POCT result also led to decreased antibiotic use. The results of studies assessing the effect of POCT on ED length of stay were not definitive. The studies assessed in this systematic review support the use of POCT for diagnosis of influenza in patients suffering an acute respiratory infection.

Animal husbandry practices that could promote the transmission of microbes from animals to humans included: the proximity of chickens to humans (50.1% of households reported that the chickens slept in the bedroom); the shared use of natural bodies of water for human and animal bathing (78.3%); the use of livestock waste as fertilizer (60.9%); and gender roles that dictate that females are the primary care takers of poultry and children (62.8%).

Suboptimal use of antimicrobials coupled with unhygienic animal husbandry practices are important risk factors for emerging zoonotic disease and resistant pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roess, Amira A.; Winch, Peter J.; Akhter, Afsana; Afroz, Dilara; Ali, Nabeel A.; Shah, Rashed; Begum, Nazma; Seraji, Habibur Rahman; Arifeen, Shams El; Darmstadt, Gary L.; Baqui, Abdullah H.","journal":"Zoonoses and Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3effa12910c66435787343ba74688b08b5450c8e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/077539042908e69c2785d880fb7ce5f90aa8a861.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4575599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25787116/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4575599?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal medicine","animal treatments","animal bathing","Animal antimicrobial use","unhygienic animal husbandry practices","local animal health care practitioners","effective animal health care system","Government animal health care providers","households","use of livestock waste","Suboptimal use of antimicrobials","risk of emerging zoonotic disease","primary care takers of poultry","humans","animals","shared use of natural bodies of water","proximity of chickens","important risk factors","villagers","females","pharmacies","resistant pathogens","antibiotic resistance","village doctors","children","times","transmission of microbes","information","absence","past performance","antibiotics","medicines","months","fertilizer","bedroom","respondents","drug-sellers","gender roles"],"language":"en"},

This paper attempts to review how the Japanese surveillance system deals with imported infectious diseases and reviews the trend of these diseases. The cases of acquired infection overseas were extracted from the surveillance data in 1999\u20132008. The incidence and rate of imported cases of a series of infectious diseases with more than one imported case were observed by the year of diagnosis and place of acquired infection. During the period 10,030 cases that could be considered to be imported infectious diseases were identified. Shigellosis ranked as the most common imported disease, followed by amebiasis, malaria, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, typhoid fever, dengue fever, hepatitis A, giardiasis, cholera, and paratyphoid fever. The annual trends of these diseases always fluctuated but not every change was investigated. The study reveals that the situation of imported infectious diseases can be identified in the current Japanese surveillance system with epidemiologic features of both temporal and geographic distribution of cases of imported infectious diseases. However, further timely investigation for unusual increase in infectious diseases is needed.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taniguchi, Kiyosu; Yoshida, Makiko; Sunagawa, Tomimasa; Tada, Yuki; Okabe, Nobuhiko","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8487c93bd56940a554ac9f5d84b67e165ad3ccd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106133.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893908001038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18984479/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2008.07.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893908001038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["imported infectious diseases","series of infectious diseases","rate of imported cases","common imported disease","Summary Surveillance","surveillance data","current Japanese surveillance system","Japanese surveillance system deals","dengue fever","paratyphoid fever","geographic distribution of cases","acquired immunodeficiency syndrome","enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection","epidemiologic features","amebiasis","malaria","giardiasis","hepatitis","need","early detection of outbreaks","international concern","unusual increase","timely investigation","cholera","information of risk","year of diagnosis","place","incidence","situation","travelers","Shigellosis","annual trends","study","paper","period","change"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the codon usage bias and the base composition variations in the available 11 complete HBoV genome sequences have been investigated. Although, there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different HBoV genes, codon usage bias in HBoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. The results of correspondence analysis (COA) and Spearman\u0027s rank correlation analysis reveals that the G\u002BC compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in HBoV and the gene\u0027s function also contributes to the codon usage in this virus. Moreover, it was found that the hydrophobicity of each protein and the gene length are also critical in affecting these viruses\u2019 codon usage, although they were less important than that of the mutational bias and the genes\u2019 function. At last, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of 44 genes from these 11 HBoV isolates is analyzed using a hierarchical cluster method. The result suggests that genes with same function yet from different isolates are classified into the same lineage and it does not depend on geographical location. These conclusions not only can offer an insight into the codon usage patterns and gene classification of HBoV, but also may help in increasing the efficiency of gene delivery/expression systems.","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Sheng; Zhang, Qin; Liu, Xiaolin; Wang, Xuemin; Zhang, Huilin; Wu, Yan; Jiang, Fei","journal":"Biosystems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f547132360d838d92c6fbb7bc264c92375bb85e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378386/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264708000336; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264708000336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["G C"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["codon usage bias","codon usage patterns","viruses\u2019 codon usage","codon position","relative synonymous codon usage","HBoV isolates","different HBoV genes","gene classification of HBoV","mutational bias","complete HBoV genome sequences","different isolates","gene\u0027s function","gene length","genes\u2019 function","efficiency of gene delivery","novel virus","base compositions","base composition variations","results of correspondence analysis","Spearman\u0027s rank correlation analysis","COA","main factor","respiratory tract disease","C compositional constraint","effective number of codons","RSCU","significant variation","infants","children","expression systems","insight","Abstract Human Bocavirus","value","hierarchical cluster method","protein","study","hydrophobicity","geographical location","conclusions","lineage"],"language":"en"},

Although covid-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome. This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to covid-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of covid-19. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of covid-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation. Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neurath, Markus F","journal":"Gut","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eac88fb4ffbb0f3a53c010235d92c4ffa91a391.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211083.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303609/; https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathophysiology of covid","progress of covid","current pandemic","context of IBD","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cytokine release syndrome","cytokine storm syndrome","current coronavirus pandemic","acute respiratory distress syndrome","immunomodulation","immunosuppression","current understanding","majority of affected patients","important question","relevant question","progressive pneumonia","organ failure","ongoing global health crisis","new insights","symptoms","lung injury","hyperinflammation","lethal complications","disease","biological therapy","mild flu","special reference","situation","various major challenges","gastroenterology","immune cell activation","leads","potential implications","fatal outcomes","intestinal ACE2 expression","key questions","instance"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A representative cluster sample size for students was estimated using Fisher et al.\u2019s formula while schools, sub-counties and education zones were clustered and sample size was calculated based on coefficient of variation by school type. Data were collected by questionnaire, medical examination using standard procedures, and focus group discussion, and descriptive analysis was performed on the completed questions. Comparisons between risk factors were made by chi-square and ANOVA analysis using SPSS for Windows (version 15.2; Chicago, IL) software. A p value of \u003C 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was significant variation between communicable disease prevalence rates and age (X(2) (4, 0.05) = 2.458), school size (X(2) (12, 0.05) = 18.636), gender (X(2) (4, 0.05) = 5.723) and class of students (X(2) (12, 0.05) = 15.202), and bed and desk spacing (p \u003C 0.05 at 95% CI). However, there was no significant association in prevalence rates between both locality and type of school. There was strong evidence that student age has an effect on prevalence rates. The prevalence rate of malaria was higher in male (14.02%) than female students (6.68%) compared to prevalence of diarrhea, which was higher in female (7.96%) than male students. CONCLUSION: This study has revealed that the prevalences of diarrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections are lower among female secondary school students than males and that the prevalence of malaria is higher in males than females. Age of secondary school students is a significant vulnerability factor for malaria, diarrhea, tuberculosis and pneumonia, which were the important communicable diseases most prevalent among secondary school students in Kisumu County, Kenya.","publish_time":"2016-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odongo, David Otieno; Wakhungu, W.

In this study, the production of the novel HIV entry inhibitor candidate, griffithsin (GRFT), was investigated using Nicotiana benthamiana as the expression platform based on a non-viral vector. To increase the yield of recombinant GRFT, the RNA silencing defense mechanism of N. benthamiana was abolished by using three gene silencing suppressors. A transient expression system was used by transferring the GRFT gene, which encodes 122 amino acids, under the control of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter. The presence of correctly assembled GRFT in transgenic leaves was confirmed using immunoglobulin-specific sandwich ELISA. The data demonstrated that the use of three gene silencing suppressors allowed the highest accumulation of GRFT, with a yield of 400 \u03BCg g\u22121 fresh weight, and this amount was reduced to 287 \u03BCg g\u22121 after purification, representing a recovery of 71.75%. The analysis also showed that the ability of GRFT expressed in N. benthamiana to bind to glycoprotein 120 is close to that of the GRFT protein purified from E. coli. Whole-cell assays using purified GRFT showed that our purified GRFT was potently active against HIV. This study provides the first high-level production of the HIV-1 entry inhibitor griffithsin with a non-viral expression system and illustrates the robustness of the co-agroinfiltration expression system improved through the use of three gene silencing suppressors.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Habibi, Peyman; Soccol, Carlos Ricardo; O\u2019Keefe, Barry R.; Krumpe, Lauren R.H.; Wilson, Jennifer; de Macedo, Leonardo Lima Pepino; Faheem, Muhammad; Dos Santos, Vanessa Olinto; Prado, Guilherme Souza; Botelho, Marco Antonio; Lacombe, Severine; Grossi-de-Sa, Maria Fatima","journal":"Process Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40d3023935b63b2342ed22d68948ce26f64b3b7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108441.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359511318301740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288594/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2018.04.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511318301740","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["HIV","GRFT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GRFT gene","purified GRFT","GRFT protein","assembled GRFT","ability of GRFT","yield of recombinant GRFT","highest accumulation of GRFT","gene silencing suppressors","non-viral expression system","transient expression system","expression platform","co-agroinfiltration expression system","entry inhibitor griffithsin","novel HIV entry inhibitor candidate","use","high-level production","Nicotiana benthamiana","\u03BCg g","study","efficient production of protein microbicides","RNA silencing defense mechanism of","non-viral vector","robustness","control","transgenic leaves","exploration of emerging host organisms","enhanced CaMV","immunoglobulin-specific sandwich ELISA","S promoter","amino acids","purification","fresh weight","presence","cell assays","resource-poor areas","glycoprotein","coli","recovery","analysis","data"],"language":"en"},

Non-tailed bacteriophages MS2 (single-stranded RNA), \u03D56 (double-stranded RNA, enveloped), PR772 (double-stranded DNA), and \u03D5X174 (single-stranded DNA) were first aerosolized in a 55L rotative environmental chamber at 19\u00B0C with 25% and 50% relative humidity. Then, hydrogen peroxide, Eugenol (phenylpropene used in commercial perfumes and flavorings), Mist(\u00AE) (automobile disinfectant containing Triethylene glycol), and Pledge(\u00AE) (multisurface disinfectant containing Isopropanol, n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium Chlorides, and n-Alkyl Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride) were nebulized with the phages using a separate nebulizer. Aerosols were maintained in suspension during 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours. Viral aerosols were sampled using an SKC BioSampler and samples were analyzed using qPCR and plaque assays. The resistance levels of the four phages varied depending on the relative humidity (RH) and germicidal products tested. Phage MS2 was the most stable airborne virus under the environmental conditions tested while phage PR772 was the least stable. Pledge(\u00AE) and Eugenol reduced the infectivity of all airborne phages tested. At 25% RH, Pledge(\u00AE) and Eugenol were more effective at reducing infectivity of RNA phages \u03D56 and MS2. At 50% RH, Pledge(\u00AE) was the most effective agent against phage MS2. These findings illustrate that various airborne viruses should be tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of germicidal treatments. This research also provides a set of parameters for testing germicidal products in large-scale settings to reduce the risk of virus transmission.","publish_time":"2016-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turgeon, Nathalie; Michel, Kevin; Ha, Thi-Lan; Robine, Enric; Moineau, Sylvain; Duchaine, Caroline","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24c739b85e7c9082d00e9680cf7a99070c427d55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5193356.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28030577/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Triethylene","Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airborne phages","Pledge","Phage MS2","infectivity of RNA phages \u03D56","single-stranded RNA","double-stranded RNA","various airborne viruses","Eugenol","Viral aerosols","RH","single-stranded DNA","double-stranded DNA","stable airborne virus","animal viruses","hazardous viruses","bacterial viruses","germicidal products","phage PR772","different relative humidity levels","Non-tailed bacteriophages MS2","efficacy of aerosolized chemicals","viral loads","Viral diseases","effectiveness of germicidal treatments","n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium Chlorides","n-Alkyl Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride","environmental conditions","automobile disinfectant","multisurface disinfectant","effective agent","resistance levels","rotative environmental chamber","risk of virus transmission","physical characteristics similar","pathogenic human","morphological size","type of nucleic acids","phenylpropene","Isopropanol","aerosol studies","capsid morphology","Mist","commercial perfumes","large-scale settings","surrogates","\u03D5X174","set of parameters","qPCR","samples","flavorings","SKC BioSampler","Triethylene glycol","presence","limited data","suspension","hydrogen peroxide","variety of routes","findings","plaque assays","laboratory workers","minutes","research","study","separate nebulizer","hours","envelope"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, SPs compliance among NSs can be enhanced by increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting management support, reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs.","publish_time":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheung, Kin; Chan, Chi Keung; Chang, Mei Yan; Chu, Po Ha; Fung, Wai Fong; Kwan, Kit Chi; Lau, Nga Yan; Li, Wai Kin; Mak, Hiu Man","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b5d106a9955d061e1c81502976f29f3765b40be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115313.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.03.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655315001522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25868650/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655315001522","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["better SPs compliance","SPs training","knowledge of SPs","SPs knowledge","nursing staff compliance","identified SPs barriers","mean frequency score of SPs compliance","year of study","nursing students","NSs","interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff","study questionnaire","perceived barriers","management support","cross-sectional survey study","adequacy of training","health belief model","frequency of standard precautions","univariate general linear model","test","content validity index","factors","Tukey honest significant difference","analysis","F1","questionnaires","Cronbach \u03B1 range","Methods","following predictors","Conclusion","response rate","Results","Background"],"language":"en"},

Samples were obtained from patients 60 years of age or above who were newly admitted to Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The patients were interviewed for current symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Using rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, comparable sets of mucosal samples were harvested from the nasopharynx and the oropharynx. The samples were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. A total of 223 patients (mean age 74.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 9.0 years) were swabbed and a virus was recovered from 11% of the symptomatic patients. Regardless of the sampling site, a calculated 4.8 times higher viral load (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3\u201317, p = 0.017) was obtained using the nylon flocked swabs as compared to the rayon swabs. Also, regardless of the type of swab, a calculated 19 times higher viral load was found in the samples from the nasopharynx as compared to the oropharynx (95% CI 5.4\u201367.4, p \u003C 0.001).

In this study, we investigated the transmission routes of MERS\u2010CoV during the first nosocomial outbreak in the Republic of Korea in May 2015 using a multi\u2010agent modeling framework. We identified seven hypothesized transmission modes based on the three main transmission routes (long\u2010range airborne, close contact, and fomite). The infection risks for each hypothesis were estimated using the multi\u2010agent modeling framework. Least\u2010squares fitting was conducted to compare the distribution of the predicted infection risk in the various scenarios with that of the reported attack rates and to identify the hypotheses with the best fit. In the scenarios in which the index patient was a super\u2010spreader, our model simulations suggested that MERS\u2010CoV probably spread via the long\u2010range airborne route. However, it is possible that the index patient shed an average viral load comparable to the loads reported in the literature, and that transmission occurred via a combined long\u2010range airborne and close contact route.","publish_time":"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, S.; Li, Y.; Sung, M.; Wei, J.; Yang, Z.","journal":"Indoor Air","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b4b3ff81ed14d80978af1bd116493a6aea3fe23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165997.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28960494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["transmission routes of MERS","CoV","main transmission routes","long\u2010range airborne route","hypothesized transmission modes","index patient","close contact route","multi\u2010agent modeling framework","various scenarios","infection risks","predicted infection risk","reported attack rates","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","average viral load comparable","prevalence","loads","super\u2010spreader","model simulations","serious health issue","nosocomial outbreak","current recommended control strategies","hypotheses","evidence","distribution","hypothesis","Republic of Korea","Infections","fomite","associated mortality","best fit","literature","study","squares fitting"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the broad antiviral spectrum and mode of action of an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai was evaluated in vitro, and moreover, the protective effect against divergent influenza A subtypes was determined in BALB/c mice. An effective dose of Epimedium koreanum Nakaimarkedly reduced the replication of Influenza A Virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells. Mechanically, we found that an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent stimulation of the antiviral state in cells. Among various components present in the extract, quercetin was confirmed to have striking antiviral properties. The oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai exhibited preventive effects on BALB/c mice against lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2). Therefore, an extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai and its components play roles as immunomodulators in the innate immune response, and may be potential candidates for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against diverse viruses in animal and humans.","publish_time":"2015-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Won-Kyung; Weeratunga, Prasanna; Lee, Byeong-Hoon; Park, Jun-Seol; Kim, Chul-Joong; Ma, Jin Yeul; Lee, Jong-Soo","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12c2a6ee1e3e7cf0f915e5c5454627b7e1ed9db3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4306843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609307/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7010352","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza A Virus","Newcastle Disease Virus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai","oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai","effective dose of Epimedium koreanum Nakaimarkedly","aqueous extract","antiviral properties","antiviral state","subtypes","BALB","Newcastle Disease Virus","Herpes Simplex Virus","Vesicular Stomatitis Virus","pathogenic influenza","replication of Influenza","divergent influenza","mode of action","broad antiviral spectrum","c mice","potential candidates","various components","HEK293T cells","plant\u2019s known immune modulatory potential","innate immune response","chemical make-up","preventive effects","therapeutic treatments","scientific information","subsequent stimulation","pro-inflammatory cytokines","lethal doses","secretion of type","diverse viruses","H1N1","VSV","HSV","PR8","roles","animal","IFN","immunomodulators","H5N2","RAW264","Chinese medicine","H7N3","NDV","protective effect","traditional Korean","H9N2","humans","study","quercetin","variety of diseases"],"language":"en"},

With the possibility of exposure to a variety of respiratory toxicants from airborne pollutants in our environment during the course of daily activities, in occupational settings, the use of aerosol sprays for household products, and the development of inhalant bronchial therapies, pulmonary toxicology has become an important subspecialty of toxicology. The lung is susceptible to injury following hematogenous exposure to toxicants. Susceptibility to injury and the type of response following exposure to air- or blood-borne toxicants is largely dependent on the physiochemical characteristics and concentration of the toxicant, duration of exposure, site/tissue specific sensitivity, and the integrity of the defense mechanisms of the lung. In this chapter, nonneoplastic and neoplastic spontaneous lesions and those that develop in the lungs of rats following exposure to toxicants by various routes, but primarily by inhalation, are discussed in detail which provides insight into our understanding of how human lungs respond to toxic chemicals. In addition, the gross and microscopic anatomy of the rat lung is also discussed some detail. Although inhalation is the primary route of exposure in experimental studies, in the past, many studies used intratracheal instillation or direct injection of known carcinogens into the lung. These experiments often resulted in the development of squamous cell carcinomas even though they are very rare as a naturally occurring neoplasm. Instillation of chemicals or particles into the trachea or pleura or direct injection into the lung results in lesions or responses that may not be as relevant to understanding the mechanism of pulmonary carcinogenesis as inhalation of materials under more normal conditions. There remain, however, many areas where our understanding of the response of the lung to toxic chemicals is incomplete.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herbert, Ronald A.; Janardhan, Kyathanahalli S.; Pandiri, Arun R.; Cesta, Mark F.; Chen, Vivian; Miller, Rodney A.","journal":"Boorman\u0027s Pathology of the Rat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1e0cb1be43c48488433881cf1134bdfb6ee4247.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149505.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012391448400023X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012391448400023X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung results","rat lung","duration of exposure","hematogenous exposure","possibility of exposure","understanding","primary route of exposure","Instillation of chemicals","toxic chemicals","pulmonary toxicology","variety of respiratory toxicants","inhalation of materials","injury","direct injection of known carcinogens","experimental studies","intratracheal instillation","type of response","toxicant xenobiotics","human lungs","lungs of rats","mechanism of pulmonary carcinogenesis","neoplastic spontaneous lesions","important subspecialty of toxicology","development of inhalant bronchial therapies","large volume of inhaled air","development of squamous cell carcinomas","occupational settings","environment","site","use of aerosol sprays","household products","airborne pollutants","tissue specific sensitivity","integrity","course of daily activities","concentration","microscopic anatomy","past","pleura","physiochemical characteristics","various routes","chapter","nonneoplastic","particles","responses","blood","addition","normal conditions","defense mechanisms","Susceptibility","insight","areas","neoplasm","experiments"],"language":"en"},

The bovine K5 strain induced diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets and calves, whereas the porcine K71 strain caused diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets, but not in calves. Furthermore, the bovine K5 strain showed extra-intestinal tropisms in both piglets and calves, whereas the porcine K71 strain had extra-intestinal tropisms in piglets, but not in calves. Therefore, we performed comparative genomic analysis of the K71 and K5 RVA strains to determine whether specific mutations could be associated with these distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. Full-length sequencing analyses for the 11 genomic segments for K71 and K5 revealed that these strains were genetically nearly identical to each other. Two nucleotide mutations were found in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of NSP5 and the 3\u2032 UTR of NSP3, and eight amino acid mutations in VP1-VP4 and NSP2.

Although the type 1 interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) is a well-known antiviral cytokine, the role of IFN-\u03B1 in antipneumococcal host defense and its therapeutic potential remain poorly understood. We have investigated these issues by using a murine transgene expression model. We found that in control animals, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection caused severe weight loss and excessive lung inflammation, associated with rapid bacterial outgrowth. In contrast, the animals that received a single dose of an adenoviral vector expressing IFN-\u03B1 prior to pneumococcal infection demonstrated rapid and effective control of bacterial replication and lung inflammation and improved clinical outcome. Enhanced protection by IFN-\u03B1 was due to increased activation of neutrophils and macrophages with increased release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and bacterial killing. Furthermore, we found that raised levels of IFN-\u03B1 in the lung remained immune protective even when the gene transfer vector was given at a time postpneumococcal infection. Our study thus shows that the classically antiviral type 1 IFN can be exploited for enhancing immunity against pneumococcal infection via its activating effects on innate immune cells. Our findings hold implications for the therapeutic use of IFN-\u03B1 gene transfer strategies to combat pneumococcal infections.","publish_time":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Damjanovic, Daniela; Khera, Amandeep; Medina, Maria Fe; Ennis, Jane; Turner, Jeffrey D; Gauldie, Jack; Xing, Zhou","journal":"Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50a694871540a1ef725d3083f8a9623081326cac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/86afebc58ebd3a14ab6d730d4c5fc32dc56ec3c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4378291.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2329050116301188; https://doi.org/10.1038/mtm.2014.5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2329050116301188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015944/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1","interferon-\u03B1","role of IFN","levels of IFN","therapeutic use of IFN","\u03B1 gene transfer strategies","Pneumococcal infections","excessive lung inflammation","Streptococcus pneumoniae infection","gene transfer vector","rapid bacterial outgrowth","bacterial killing","control animals","time postpneumococcal infection","antiviral type","effective control of bacterial replication","adenoviral vector","immune protective","therapeutic potential","increased activation of neutrophils","innate immune cells","well-known antiviral cytokine","increased release of reactive oxygen","severe weight loss","macrophages","nitrogen species","activating effects","antipneumococcal host defense","improved clinical outcome","leading cause of community","single dose","implications","murine transgene expression model","immunity","issues","findings","Enhanced protection","contrast","study"],"language":"en"},

On a 10-fold dilution series of a MERS-CoV\u2013positive EQC sample, InGenius obtained the highest detection rate. Laboratory technicians rated the ARIES as the user-friendliest. It also required the least hands-on time. BD MAX had the lowest turnaround time and highest throughput. While each device had distinguishing system properties with associated (dis)advantages, the 3 S2R systems were comparable in terms of assay development and validation.","publish_time":"2019-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frans, Glynis; Beuselinck, Kurt; Peeters, Bart; Van Ranst, Marc; Saegeman, Veroniek; Desmet, Stefanie; Lagrou, Katrien","journal":"Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c7ca66668249f82b79e4873baf99bdb043c1c96.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e50158c2a2fa2b74a7f19b9b705b6cfb9c5266de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127711.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889318305030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929995/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889318305030; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2019.02.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["MAX"],"organizations":["ARIES","Luminex","External Quality Control"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["BD MAX","ARIES","InGenius system","MERS-CoV","ELITe InGenius","S2R systems","device","positive EQC sample","use of lab","MultiCode primers","highest throughput","curve analysis","assay optimization","hands-on time","lowest turnaround time","terms of assay development","distinguishing system properties","highest detection rate","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","conversion","External Quality Control","TaqMan probes","ELITechGroup","samples","day of training","advantages","fold dilution series","study","validation","LDT","test","Laboratory technicians","user-friendliest","discordant results","Luminex","goal"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This study included all consecutive patients who were admitted for a diagnosis of AECOPD during June 2013 to May 2015. Thirty\u2010one stable COPD patients and 31 healthy controls were also recruited. Oropharyngeal samples were assessed, PCR for respiratory viruses were performed. Patients were divided into AECOPD virus\u2010positive (\u002B) group and AECOPD virus\u2010negative (\u2212) group according to viral detection. Luminex was used to detect the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the serum. RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were included with a mean age of 75 \u00B1 0.5 years. There were 72 patients (27.3%) identified with viral positive, of whom two patients were detected with double viral infections (FluA \u002B FluB and RSVA \u002B HRV, respectively). The rate of viral detection was associated with season, highest in winter. Comparisons of clinical characteristics showed no significant differences between AECOPD virus\u002B group and AECOPD virus\u2212 group. However, serum concentrations of interferon\u2010inducible protein\u201010 (IP\u201010) and interferon\u2010gamma (IFN\u2010\u03B3) in virus\u002B AECOPD patients were significantly higher than those in the virus\u2212 AECOPD, stable COPD and healthy control groups (P \u003C .05). CONCLUSION: Viral infection was an important pathogen in AECOPD patients; the most common viruses included FluA, HRV and FluB. It was very difficult to diagnose the viral infection according to clinical characteristics. The increased of serum IP\u201010 and IFN\u2010\u03B3 levels might be value to indicate viral infection in AECOPD.","publish_time":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Tiping; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Mei, Zhoufang; Feng, Jingjing; Zhang, Wanju; He, Yanchao; Shi, Jindong; Qian, Ling; Liu, Yi; Huang, Qihui; Hu, Yunwen; Jie, Zhijun","journal":"Clin Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5630ef4d94b44c63cd27072c0047bfd0901c1830.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162408.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586150/; https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12656","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex","AECOPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AECOPD patients","AECOPD virus","diagnosis of AECOPD","consecutive patients","stable COPD patients","rate of viral detection","double viral infections","Comparisons of clinical characteristics","serum concentrations of interferon","FluA","FluB","IFN","HRV","increased of serum IP","healthy controls","\u03B3 levels","common viruses","respiratory viruses","healthy control groups","concentrations of inflammatory cytokines","acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","significant differences","value","important pathogen","inducible protein","PCR","RSVA","season","Shanghai","biomarkers","study","mean age","gamma","CONCLUSION","Oropharyngeal samples","METHODS","years","winter","RESULTS","total","OBJECTIVE","Luminex"],"language":"en"},

The possibility that IBD is an infection has been debated since the first description of Crohn\u2019s disease. Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis was the first organism to be suggested as an IBD pathogen, and it has been argued that it fulfils Koch\u2019s postulates and could be designated the cause of Crohn\u2019s disease. Other organisms have been postulated as possible IBD pathogens, including various Helicobacter species, one of which has been identified in primate colitis; others are widely used in animal models of IBD. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli appear specific to ileal Crohn\u2019s disease and have been shown to induce the release of TNF-\u03B1, a key cytokine in IBD inflammation. The aim of this article is to give a concise overview of the infections postulated as being relevant to the onset of IBD. We will also briefly cover the immunology underpinning IBD, in addition to reviewing current knowledge regarding other microorganisms that are associated with modifying the risk of developing IBD.

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric SOT recipients (January 2010 to June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Charts were reviewed for RVI events associated with hospitalization within 1 year after the transplant. An RVI diagnosis required respiratory symptoms and detection of a virus (ie, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline SOT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. RESULTS: Of 1096 pediatric SOT recipients (448 liver, 289 kidney, 251 heart, 66 lung, 42 intestine/multivisceral), 159 (14.5%) developed RVI associated with hospitalization within 12 months after their transplant. RVI occurred at the highest rates in intestine/abdominal multivisceral (38%), thoracic (heart/lung) (18.6%), and liver (15.6%) transplant recipients and a lower rate in kidney (5.5%) transplant recipients. RVI was associated with younger median age at transplant (1.72 vs 7.89 years; P \u003C .001) and among liver or kidney transplant recipients with the receipt of a deceased-donor graft compared to a living donor (P = .01). The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of RVI onset were 4% and 0%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that age was independently associated with increased risk for a pulmonary complication (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.02\u20131.51]) and that receipt of an intestine/multivisceral transplant was associated with increased risk of all-cause death (odds ratio, 24.54 [95% confidence interval, 1.69\u2013327.96]). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, hospital-associated RVI was common in the first year after pediatric SOT and associated with younger age at transplant. All-cause death after RVI was rare, and no definitive attributable death occurred.","publish_time":"2018-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danziger-Isakov, Lara; Steinbach, William J; Paulsen, Grant; Munoz, Flor M; Sweet, Leigh R; Green, Michael; Michaels, Marian G; Englund, Janet A; Murray, Alastair; Halasa, Natasha; Dulek, Daniel E; Madan, Rebecca Pellett; Herold, Betsy C; Fisher, Brian T","journal":"J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fe8ab9531a38af72ffad1460b1a821a1e58433d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107524.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piy024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29538674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multivisceral transplant","kidney transplant recipients","hospital-associated RVI","RVI diagnosis","RVI events","incidence of RVI","months of RVI onset","pediatric solid organ transplant","US pediatric transplant centers","retrospective observational cohort of pediatric SOT recipients","parainfluenza virus","increased risk of all-cause death","Respiratory virus infection","respiratory syncytial virus","liver","intestine","younger age","definitive attributable death","association of baseline SOT factors","significant risk","younger median age","odds ratio","receipt","respiratory symptoms","abdominal multivisceral","hospitalization","lung","heart","confidence interval","human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","highest rates","attributable case-fatality rates","living donor","subsequent pulmonary complications","deceased-donor graft","era of current molecular diagnostic assays","enterovirus","coronavirus","vs","detection","Multivariable logistic regression models","epidemiology","study","BACKGROUND","lower rate","effects","METHODS","years","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","Charts"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and significance of CXCL14 in CRC progression. METHOD: 265 colorectal carcinoma specimens and 129 matched adjacent normal colorectal mucosa specimens were collected. Expression of CXCL14 in clinical samples was examined by immunostaining. The effect of CXCL14 on colorectal carcinoma cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, BrdU incorporation assay and colony formation assay. The impact of CXCL14 on migration and invasion of colorectal carcinoma cells was determined by transwell assay and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. RESULTS: CXCL14 expression was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous mucosa tissues (P \u003C 0.001). Tumoral CXCL14 expression levels were significantly correlated with TNM (Tumor-node-metastasis) stage, histodifferentiation, and tumor size. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, high CXCL14 expression in tumor specimens (n = 91) from stage I/II patients was associated with increased risk for disease recurrence (risk ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.15-7.40; P = 0.024). Elevated CXCL14 expression in tumor specimens (n = 135) from stage III/IV patients correlated with worse overall survival (risk ratio, 3.087; 95% CI, 1.866-5.107; P \u003C 0.001). Functional studies demonstrated that enforced expression of CXCL14 in SW620 colorectal carcinoma cells resulted in more aggressive phenotypes. In contrast, knockdown of CXCL14 expression could mitigate the proliferative, migratory and invasive potential of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, CXCL14 might be a potential novel prognostic factor to predict the disease recurrence and overall survival and could be a potential target of postoperative adjuvant therapy in CRC patients.","publish_time":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Jun; Yang, Xudan; Cheng, Lin; Liu, Rui; Lei, Yunlong; Dong, Dandan; Li, Fanghua; Lau, Quek Choon; Deng, Longfei; Nice, Edouard C; Xie, Ke; Huang, Canhua","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de22df7c68cc8f64265c0a26ef9f2acd53520ef6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3551837.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-11-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of CXCL14","high CXCL14 expression","enforced expression of CXCL14","Elevated CXCL14 expression","knockdown of CXCL14 expression","significance of CXCL14","effect of CXCL14","impact of CXCL14","chemokine CXCL14","colorectal carcinoma specimens","Tumoral CXCL14 expression levels","invasion of colorectal carcinoma cells","SW620 colorectal carcinoma cells","tumor specimens","expression pattern","colorectal carcinoma cell proliferation","invasive potential of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells","tumor tissues","MTT assay","transwell assay","papillary thyroid carcinoma","Tumor-node","tumor size","CRC patients","stage","matched adjacent normal colorectal mucosa specimens","Matrigel invasion assay","risk ratio","CRC progression","BrdU incorporation assay","colony formation assay","disease recurrence","increased risk","IV patients","adjacent nontumorous mucosa tissues","worse overall survival","potential novel prognostic factor","important role","potential target of postoperative adjuvant therapy","multivariate Cox regression analysis","migration","breast cancer","malignancies","histodifferentiation","metastasis","TNM","clinical samples","Functional studies","aggressive phenotypes","study","contrast","METHOD","immunostaining","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","purpose","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Detailed analyses of the complete genomes of different PEDV strains are essential to understand the relationships among re\u2010emerging and historic strains worldwide. Here, we analysed the complete genomes of 409 strains from different countries, which were classified into five subgroup strains (i.e., GI\u2010a, GI\u2010b, GII\u2010a, GII\u2010b, and GII\u2010c). Phylogenetic study of different genes in the PEDV strains revealed that the newly discovered subgroup GII\u2010c exhibited inconsistent topologies between the spike gene and other genes. Furthermore, recombination analysis indicated that GII\u2010c viruses evolved from a recombinant virus that acquired the 5\u2032 part of the spike gene from the GI\u2010a subgroup and the remaining genomic regions from the GII\u2010a subgroup. Molecular clock analysis showed that divergence of the GII\u2010c subgroup spike gene occurred in April 2010, suggesting that the subgroup originated from recombination events before the PEDV re\u2010emergence outbreaks. Interestingly, Ascaris suum, a large roundworm occurring in pigs, was found to be an unusual PEDV host, providing potential support for cross\u2010host transmission. This study has significant implications for understanding ongoing global PEDV outbreaks and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventative measures against PEDV.","publish_time":"2018-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Jiahui; Fang, Liurong; Ye, Xu; Chen, Jiyao; Xu, Shangen; Zhu, Xinyu; Miao, Yimin; Wang, Dang; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef2e5bdd3e68f5986bca621bca30d67755c527fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168555.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102851/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["subgroup strains","discovered subgroup GII","c subgroup spike gene","complete genomes of different PEDV strains","PEDV re\u2010emergence outbreaks","unusual PEDV host","historic strains","ongoing global PEDV outbreaks","c viruses","different countries","Phylogenetic study of different genes","recombination analysis","host transmission","recombination events","recombinant virus","Molecular clock analysis","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","potential support","future efforts","inconsistent topologies","divergence","significant implications","effective preventative measures","relationships","remaining genomic regions","large roundworm","re\u2010emerging","Detailed analyses","Ascaris suum","pigs","China"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months-old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 to 425.0 cases per 100,000 infants \u003C12 months old, with 2 peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (P\u003C.05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.","publish_time":"2017-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iglesias, Laura; Casabella Pernas, Antonio; Hern\u00E1ndez Febles, Melisa; Colino Gil, Elena; Eisman Maraver, Alicia; Pena L\u00F3pez, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9","journal":"An Pediatr (Barc)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa01c29dbfecae6c944aa503f98b30db9b7dea79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185807.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29223471/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2017.10.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gran Canaria"],"keyphrases":["incidence of pertussis","pertussis cough","PATIENTS","microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection","lower development of complications","clinical pattern of Bordetella pertussis infection","lower age","hospitalised infants","infants younger","increased risk of developing complications","months-old","months old","main potential sources of infection","non-vaccination status","Viral co-infection","paediatric hospital","Gran Canaria","annual incidence of hospital admissions","cases","Main clinical features","patient hospital records","whooping cough","risk factors","retrospective review","mortality rates","signs of catarrh","year-old","polymerase chain reaction","Household members","future","cyanosis","previous period","outcome","decline","METHODS","years","pregnant women","lymphocytosis","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","total","pneumonia","peaks","CONCLUSIONS","males"],"language":"en"},

Most of these bacteria are lactic acid bacteria, which are part of the healthy human microbiota. However, little is known about the effects of transient bacteria present in normal diets, including Lactococcus lactis. METHODS: In the present study, we analysed the immunomodulatory effects of three L. lactis strains in vitro using intestinal epithelial cells. L. lactis NCDO 2118 was administered for 4 days to C57BL/6 mice during the remission period of colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). RESULTS: Only one strain, L. lactis NCDO 2118, was able to reduce IL-1\u03B2-induced IL-8 secretion in Caco-2 cells, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect. Oral treatment using L. lactis NCDO 2118 resulted in a milder form of recurrent colitis than that observed in control diseased mice. This protective effect was not attributable to changes in secretory IgA (sIgA); however, NCDO 2118 administration was associated with an early increase in IL-6 production and sustained IL-10 production in colonic tissue. Mice fed L. lactis NCDO 2118 had an increased number of regulatory CD4(\u002B) T cells (Tregs) bearing surface TGF-\u03B2 in its latent form (Latency-associated peptide-LAP) in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen.

In an outbreak of a completely new infectious disease like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), estimation of the fatality rate over the course of the epidemic is of clinical and epidemiological importance. In contrast with the constant case fatality rate, a new measure, termed the \u2018realtime\u2019 fatality rate, is proposed for monitoring the new emerging epidemic at a population level. A competing risk model implemented via a counting process is used to estimate the realtime fatality rate in an epidemic of SARS. It can capture and reflect the time\u2010varying nature of the fatality rate over the course of the outbreak in a timely and accurate manner. More importantly, it can provide information on the efficacy of a certain treatment and management policy for the disease. The method has been applied to the SARS data from the regions affected, namely Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, Taiwan and Beijing. The magnitudes and patterns of the estimated fatalities are virtually the same except in Beijing, which has a lower rate. It is speculated that the effect is linked to the different treatment protocols that were used.

DESIGN Descriptive study. SETTING Nembro, in the Bergamo province of Lombardy, northern Italy. POPULATION Residents of Nembro. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Monthly all cause mortality between January 2012 and April 2020 (data to 11 April), number of confirmed deaths from covid-19 to 11 April 2020, and weekly absolute number of deaths between 1 January and 4 April across recent years by age group and sex. RESULTS Nembro had 11 505 residents as of 1 January 2020. Monthly all cause mortality between January 2012 and February 2020 fluctuated around 10 per 1000 person years, with a maximum of 21.5 per 1000 person years. In March 2020, monthly all cause mortality reached a peak of 154.4 per 1000 person years. For the first 11 days in April, this rate decreased to 23.0 per 1000 person years. The observed increase in mortality was driven by the number of deaths among older people (\u226565 years), especially men. From the outbreak onset until 11 April 2020, only 85 confirmed deaths from covid-19 in Nembro were recorded, corresponding to about half of the 166 deaths from all causes observed in that period. CONCLUSIONS The study findings show how covid-19 can have a considerable impact on the health of a small community. Furthermore, the results suggest that the full implications of the covid-19 pandemic can only be completely understood if, in addition to confirmed deaths related to covid-19, consideration is also given to all cause mortality in a given region and time frame.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piccininni, Marco; Rohmann, Jessica L; Foresti, Luca; Lurani, Caterina; Kurth, Tobias","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bergamo","Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["covid","cause mortality","person years","number of confirmed deaths","recent years","RESULTS Nembro","SETTING Nembro","weekly absolute number of deaths","POPULATION Residents of Nembro","pandemic","considerable impact","given region","study findings","observed increase","impact of coronavirus disease","DESIGN Descriptive study","Bergamo province of Lombardy","Italian city","northern Italy","health","age group","sex","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","older people","maximum","peak","time frame","CONCLUSIONS","implications","addition","small community","OBJECTIVE","rate","causes","consideration","outbreak onset","days","period","data","men","half"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: In single-day lag models, a 10 \u03BCg/m(3) increase in particulate matter was associated with significant increases in non-accidental (PM(10) ER: 0.627%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.260\u20130.995% and PM(2.5) ER: 0.660%; 95% CI: 0.204\u20131.118%) and cardiovascular mortality (PM(10) ER: 0.897; 95% CI: 0.283\u20131.516 and PM(2.5) ER: 0.883%; 95% CI: 0.121\u20131.621%). This was significant in the elderly \u2265 65 years but not in those \u003C 65 years and were seen in the acute phase of lag 0-5 days. Effects by other pollutants were minimal. For cardiovascular mortality, the effects turned protective at a cumulative lag of 30 days in the elderly and could due to \u201Charvesting\u201D. CONCLUSIONS: These first contemporary population-based data from an equatorial country with tropical climate show that exposure to particulate air pollution was significantly associated with non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality, especially in the elderly.

Abstract Adenoviruses most commonly cause respiratory illness; however, depending on the infecting serotype, they may also cause various other diseases. Diagnosis may be difficult to achieve. The clinical findings for 116 children hospitalised with adenoviral infection were studied retrospectively. In 71 children, the diagnosis was based on detection of adenovirus antigen in the nasopharyngeal specimens and in 71 children on viral culture. The clinical picture of adenoviral infection was characterised by high-grade (mean 39\u00B01C) and prolonged fever (mean duration 4,3 days). Upper respiratory and lower respiratory symptoms were the most common infections. Twelve had been admitted to the hospital due to febrile convulsions, 6 had meningitis. Laboratory findings varied from normal values to values seen in bacterial infections. Thus it was difficult to distinguish adenoviral disease from a bacterial disease. Fifty-nine children were referred to the hospital due to infection unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy. Symptoms of respiratory infection caused by adenovirus may range from the common cold syndrome to pneumonia, croup and bronchiolitis. Adenoviruses can be responsible for severe consequences, even in previously healthy children. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of viral infections of the airways could provide important insights into the nature of the inflammatory process involved in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most infections are mild and require no therapy or only symptomatic treatment. There are at present time no recognised antiviral agents that are effective in treating serious adenovirus disease. The rapid detection of adenovirus antigen in nasopharygeal specimens proved to have a great clinical value in the diagnosis.","publish_time":"2004-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brouard, J.; Vabret, A.; Bach, N.; Toutain, F.; Duhamel, J.

Methods The data of all probable SARS cases were derived from the Infectious Disease Reporting System of the Center of Diseases Control and Hospital Information Systems, during the 2003 epidemic in mainland China. The definition of probable SARS case was consistent with the definition for clinically confirmed SARS issued by the Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the association of CFR with age, sex, residence location, occupation, the period of the epidemic and the duration from symptom onset to admission into hospital. Results The overall CFR was 6.4% among 5327 probable SARS cases in mainland China. Old age, being a patient during the early period of a local outbreak, and being from Tianjin led to a relatively higher CFR than young age, late stage of a local outbreak and cases from Beijing. Guangdong Province resulted in an even lower CFR compared with Beijing. Conclusions Because of their deteriorated health status and apparent complications, SARS patients aged \u003E60 years had a much higher risk of dying than younger patients. At the early stage of local outbreaks, lack of experience in patient care and perhaps treatment also led to a relatively higher CFR. The Tianjin SARS outbreak happened mainly within a hospital, leading to a high impact of co\u2010morbidity. The relatively young age of the cases partly explains the low CFR in mainland China compared with other countries and areas affected by SARS.","publish_time":"2009-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Na; Feng, Dan; Fang, Li\u2010Qun; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Han, Xiao\u2010Na; Cao, Wu\u2010Chun; De Vlas, Sake J.","journal":"Trop Med Int Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/267505e43ea1bb50db5d554959373f2bf9fd2f9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169690.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02147.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19508439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CFR"],"locations":["China","Beijing","Tianjin"],"keyphrases":["probable SARS cases","SARS patients","higher CFR","confirmed SARS","probable cases","mainland China","Tianjin SARS outbreak","definition of probable SARS case","association of CFR","lower CFR","low CFR","overall CFR","young age","higher risk","Old age","People\u2019s Republic of China","early stage of local outbreaks","epidemic","early period","Beijing","Hospital Information Systems","late stage","risk factors","Ministry of Health","patient care","younger patients","deteriorated health status","case fatality ratio","Center of Diseases Control","severe acute respiratory syndrome","lack of experience","sex","apparent complications","Infectious Disease Reporting System","residence location","multivariate logistic regression analysis","duration","occupation","symptom onset","comprehensive dataset","admission","treatment","years","countries","high impact of co\u2010morbidity","Objective","Conclusions","Methods","areas","Guangdong Province"],"language":"en"},

Methods We analysed epidemiological information and collected serum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with SARS in Guangdong in mid-February, 2003. We did virus isolation, serological tests, and molecular assays to identify the causative agent. Findings SARS had been circulating in other cities of Guangdong Province for about 2 months before causing a major outbreak in Guangzhou, the province\u0027s capital. A novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (CoV), was isolated from specimens from three patients with SARS. Viral antigens were also directly detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from these patients. 48 of 55 (87%) patients had antibodies to SARS CoV in their convalescent sera. Genetic analysis showed that the SARS CoV isolates from Guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries, and had a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of SARS to the other parts of the world.

Forty-eight hours later the allatoic fluid was taken and used to start a cycle of eight passages through 9-d-old embryos. Seven days after the last passage, embryos were harvested and macroscopic lesions in all organs were recorded. Proventriculus and gizzard samples were obtained from all embryos and routinely processed for microscopic and ultrastructural examinations. The UNAM-97 IBV variant strain caused two macroscopic lesions uncommon for Mexican strains: thin-walled proventriculus and gizzard, as well as urate accumulation within an extra-embryonic peritoneal sac, leaving the body through the umbilical duct and accompanied by the yolk sac. At microscopic level, two relevant findings were observed to be produced by this variant. In the proventriculus, there was a decrease in the gland papillary branching, while the gizzard showed a significant reduction in mucosa thickness and tubular-to-proliferative-cell ratio, as well as an absence of hyaline secretion in the lumen. Electrodense material scattered in proventricular and gizzard cells was observed, with a structure consistent with that of coronaviruses. These pathological chicken embryo findings have not been reported as being caused by other IBV strains in Mexico.","publish_time":"2002-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Escorcia, M; Fortoul, TI; Petrone, VM; Galindo, F; Lopez, C; Tellez, G","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f942a826a2868fe8acaef4bf2e975c2c21b21af7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5325e8dc28fc8f65957fc43013bb9d1f0ff591a5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119437814; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119437814","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["microscopic lesions","UNAM","IBV variant strain","IBV strains","gizzard cells","gizzard samples","d-old embryos","macroscopic lesions uncommon","specific pathogen-free chicken embryos","microscopic level","yolk sac","chorioallantoic sac","walled proventriculus","Mexican strains","extra-embryonic peritoneal sac","positive control","negative control","pathological chicken embryo findings","relevant findings","tubular","infectious bronchitis virus","urate accumulation","mucosa thickness","body","significant reduction","sterile PBS","decrease","gland papillary branching","description of gross","Mass","umbilical duct","Electrodense material","absence of hyaline secretion","proliferative-cell ratio","passages","lumen","structure consistent","hours","allatoic fluid","coronaviruses","ultrastructural examinations","groups","organs","Mexico","days","cycle"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, developing specific and sensitive laboratory tests for SARS as well as effective vaccines are necessary for national authorities. RESULTS: Genes encoding truncated nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARSCoV were cloned into the expression vector pQE30 and fusionally expressed in Escherichia coli M15. The fusion protein was analyzed for reactivity with SARS patients\u0027 sera and with anti-sera against the two human coronaviruses HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 by ELISA, IFA and immunoblot assays. Furthermore, to evaluate the antigen-specific humoral antibody and T-cell responses in mice, the fusion protein was injected into 6-week-old BALB/c mice and a neutralization test as well as a T-cell analysis was performed. To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of immunization, BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with SARSCoV at day 33 post injection and viral loads were determined by fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. Serological results showed that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the truncated S-N fusion protein derived the SARS virus were \u003E 99% (457/460) and 100.00% (650/650), respectively. Furthermore there was no cross-reactivity with other two human coronaviruses. High titers of antibodies to SRASCoV appeared in the immunized mice and the neutralization test showed that antibodies to the fusion protein could inhibit SARSCoV. The T cell proliferation showed that the fusion protein could induce an antigen-specific T-cell response. Fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR showed that BALB/c mice challenged intranasally with SARSCoV at day 33 post injection were completely protected from virus replication. CONCLUSION: The truncated S-N fusion protein is a suitable immunodiagnostic antigen and vaccine candidate.","publish_time":"2008-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu, Feng; Niu, Dongsheng; Mu, Jingsong; He, Bo; Han, Weiguo; Fan, Baoxing; Huang, Shengyong; Qiu, Yan; You, Bo; Chen, Weijun","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e63eaf2a9904a7212185d87824ddd187ab110272.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2613400.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-8-207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19038059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["truncated S-N fusion protein","c mice","SARS virus","immunized mice","T-cell responses","antigen-specific T-cell response","T cell proliferation","T-cell analysis","SARS patients\u0027 sera","effective vaccines","proteins of SARSCoV","truncated nucleocapsid","human coronaviruses HCoV","antigen-specific humoral antibody","post injection","day","week-old BALB","neutralization test","fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR","suitable immunodiagnostic antigen","absence of effective drugs","HCoV OC43","anti-sera","cross-reactivity","Serological results","virus replication","High titers of antibodies","viral loads","appropriate management","close contacts","spike","diagnostic sensitivity","ELISA","rapid identification of cases","SRASCoV","specificity","sensitive laboratory tests","IFA","vaccine candidate","national authorities","antiviral efficacy of immunization","Genes","expression vector pQE30","Escherichia coli M15","CONCLUSION","assays","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We also performed functional overrepresentation analysis of interacting proteins to understand their role in COVID-2019 severity. RESULTS It was found that over-expressed Prevotella proteins can promote viral infection. As per the results, Prevotella proteins, but not viral proteins are involved in multiple interactions with NF-kB, which is involved in increasing clinical severity of COVID-2019.

Forty percent of these samples (n =26) were found to be RVA positive by a quantitative RT-PCR assay. The viral load in 11 of these samples was sufficiently high to be (partially) genotyped. G3, G14 and P[12] were the main genotypes detected, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that they were closely related to contemporary equine RVA strains detected in Europe as well as in Brazil and South Africa. Regional variation was observed with only G14 and P[12] being detected in Germany, whereas mainly G3P[12] was encountered in Belgium. Surprisingly the only G14P[12] RVA strain detected in Belgium was also found to possess the very rare P[18] genotype, which has been described only once from equine RVA strain L338 detected in the UK in 1991. Despite the identification of this uncommon P[18] genotype, G3P[12] and G14P[12] RVA strains remained the most important genotypes in Europe during the study period. Based on this finding and the knowledge that G3P[12] and G14P[12] serotypes are partially cross-reactive it can be assumed that a vaccine based on an inactivated virus of the G3P[12] genotype is still relevant in the current European epidemiological situation, although the addition of a G14 strain would most likely be beneficial.","publish_time":"2015-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matthijnssens, Jelle; Ons, Ellen; De Coster, Sarah; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Gryspeerdt, Annick; Van Ranst, Marc; Raue, Rudiger","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb0c26aefdc9cd7f546de0a0c94d5a0e93274ffa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126753.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515000280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637313/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515000280; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.01.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVA","UK"],"locations":["Europe","Slovenia","France","Brazil","South Africa","Belgium"],"keyphrases":["G3P","equine RVA strain L338","contemporary equine RVA strains","RVA positive","G14 strain","G14P","Belgium","equine populations","uncommon P","rare P","foals","Abstract Equine group","months of age","diarrheic samples","Germany","circulation of RVAs","important genotypes","main genotypes","study period","current European epidemiological situation","rotavirus","addition","quantitative RT-PCR assay","disease","sporadic data","phylogenetic analyses","Brazil","inactivated virus","UK","South Africa","vaccine","serotypes","Regional variation","viral load","finding","knowledge","identification","percent","Slovenia","Sweden","Hungary","Italy","France","Netherlands"],"language":"en"},

The utility of rapid antigen-based methods for detection of common respiratory viruses and to confirm the cause of outbreaks is well established. However, nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) offer some benefits above antigen or culture-based procedures, with the main advantages being sensitivity and range of pathogens detectable. It is important to understand how changes in our testing methodology alter respiratory virus detection and information for epidemiological studies. For viruses such as influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus, NATs offer enhanced sensitivity above antigen assays but still identify the seasonal peaks important for predicting disease and managing time-sensitive prophylaxis. For other viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus and parainfluenza virus type 4, culture and antigen-based procedures are not available and/or lack sensitivity. Thus such targets would be missed if NATs were not included in testing for surveillance and outbreak investigation. As more respiratory viruses are identified there is a need to expand surveillance and further evaluate new technologies and automation beyond currently-available diagnostics to address detection of a broad range of potential pathogens.","publish_time":"2007-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fox, Julie D.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32482e184bbf799857ba8e3228c002243b82bd21.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s1386-6532(07)70006-9; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653207700069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653207700069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18162251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory virus detection","rapid detection of respiratory viruses","detection of common respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","NATs","antigen-based procedures","surveillance","antigen assays","culture-based procedures","utility of rapid antigen-based methods","enhanced sensitivity","lack sensitivity","parainfluenza virus type","range of pathogens detectable","influenza B","testing methodology","available diagnostics","broad range of potential pathogens","outbreak investigation","time-sensitive prophylaxis","seasonal peaks important","human bocavirus","disease","coronaviruses","information","main advantages","benefits","epidemiological studies","nucleic acid amplification tests","automation","rhinoviruses","changes","new technologies","cause of outbreaks","linked cases","need","targets"],"language":"en"},

This threshold corresponds to parameters where the system\u0027s equilibrium becomes unstable. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here, we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold from fluctuations in the susceptible population. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, simulations show that they still provide useful insight into systems with a range of population sizes, environmental noise and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as well as vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.","publish_time":"2018-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Dea, Eamon B.; Park, Andrew W.; Drake, John M.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad147a4279222c5e480a5636fb879540eded760e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8b30547cc365344758ee0e97c23d673d40302cb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6030631.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29950512/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2018.0034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["epidemic threshold","threshold levels","susceptible population","host population","parameters","estimation approach","multiple distance estimates","rate of approach","range of population sizes","observation schemes","system\u0027s equilibrium","vital dynamics","slow dynamics","average rate","limit of long-term observation","Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","zoonotic pathogens","environmental noise","systems","MERS-CoV","large system","boundary","simulations","model","fluctuations","useful insight","vaccine-preventable diseases","measles","deviations","transmission","results","guidelines","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

In trial 1, phase 2, the same calves from phase 1 grouped by CON and TIL were moved to group pens (4 pens per treatment, 4 calves per pen) for the next 56 d. The starter was blended with 5% chopped grass hay and fed free choice. Trial 2 was similar to trial 1, phase 2 and used 48 two-month-old male Holstein calves. Calves were randomly selected to receive either a s.c. injection of Zuprevo (4 mg of tildipirosin/kg of BW; TIL) on d 0 or no injections (CON). In trial 1, phase 1, preweaning ADG and BCS change; postweaning starter intake and hip width change; overall starter intake, ADG, and hip width change; final hip width; and final BCS were greater for TIL than CON. During phase 2 of trial 1 and trial 2, calf ADG and hip width change were greater for TIL than CON. Overall, in transported Holstein calves, TIL improved ADG and structural growth by approximately 13%.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hill, T. M.; Quigley, J. D.; Suarez-Mena, F.

In a retrospective study of children undergoing allogeneic HCT from January 2009 to February 2015, 91 children underwent allogeneic HCT, and 62 children had RPP testing within 30 days pre\u2010HCT.

METHODS: In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. RESULTS: Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14 days before it eventually occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated decline in the epidemic starting in 14 days on February 18, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus epidemic appeared to be nonlinear and chaotic, and was responsive to effective interventions. The methods used in this study can be applied in surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health professionals, clinicians and decision-makers to take coordinative and collaborative efforts to control the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xinguang; Yu, Bin","journal":"Glob Health Res Policy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7050133.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32158961/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-020-00137-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus epidemic","RESULTS","study period","coronavirus infection","derivative modeling","Study findings","massive interventions","analysis","days","METHODS","exponential modeling analyses","general public","limited data","early period","detected cases","accelerated decline","effective interventions","massive actions","public health professionals","decision-makers","clinicians","true infections","novel","differences","accurate monitoring","outbreaks","infectious diseases","success","collaborative efforts","close-population assumption","detection rate","need","information","nature","China","BACKGROUND","surveillance","CONCLUSIONS","months"],"language":"en"},

Methods Urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution, who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Results Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room. Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations. Conclusions As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic. While there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected, the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that urologists will continue to have a unique role in helping to manage these patients. Here, we summarize recommendations for bedside urologic interventions specific to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients based on experiences from a large metropolitan hospital system. Regulations and requirements may differ on an institutional basis, so these guidelines are intended to augment specific local protocols.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Souders, Colby P.; Zhao, Hanson; Ackerman, A.

Emergence in 2006 of a novel highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) isolate in China necessitated a comparative investigation into the host transcriptome response in tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) 13 days post-infection with HP-PRRSV rJXwn06, PRRSV strain VR-2332 or sham inocula. RNA from each was prepared for next-generation sequencing. Amplified library constructs were directly sequenced and a list of sequence transcripts and counts was generated using an RNAseq analysis pipeline to determine differential gene expression. Transcripts were annotated and relative abundance was calculated based upon the number of times a given transcript was represented in the library. RESULTS: Major changes in transcript abundance occurred in response to infection with either PRRSV strain, each with over 630 differentially expressed transcripts. The largest increase in transcript level for either virus versus sham-inoculated controls were three serum amyloid A2 acute-phase isoforms. However, the degree of up or down-regulation of transcripts following infection with HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 was greater than transcript changes observed with US PRRSV VR-2332. Also, of 632 significantly altered transcripts within the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 library 55 were up-regulated and 69 were down-regulated more than 3-fold, whilst in the US PRRSV VR-2332 library only 4 transcripts were up-regulated and 116 were down-regulated more than 3-fold. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of differentially expressed gene profiles detected in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected pigs as compared to VR-2332 infected pigs was consistent with the increased pathogenicity of the HP-PRRSV in vivo.","publish_time":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Laura C; Fleming, Damarius; Arbogast, Andrew; Bayles, Darrell O; Guo, Baoqing; Lager, Kelly M; Henningson, Jamie N; Schlink, Sarah N; Yang, Han-Chun; Faaberg, Kay S; Kehrli, Marcus E","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c8a38879c8d9910167b2dab37c2d98e17701141.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3514351.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110781/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["pathogenic PRRSV","HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 library","PRRSV strain VR","US PRRSV VR","HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected pigs","regulation of transcripts","transcript changes","transcript abundance","list of sequence transcripts","transcript level","given transcript","Major changes","Amplified library constructs","fold","days post-infection","gene profiles","sham inocula","relative abundance","host transcriptome response","respiratory syndrome virus","sham-inoculated controls","differential gene expression","major pathogen of swine","tracheobronchial lymph nodes","TBLN","serum amyloid A2 acute-phase isoforms","RNAseq analysis pipeline","increased pathogenicity","comparative investigation","counts","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","novel","China","number of times","largest increase","magnitude","generation sequencing","CONCLUSIONS","Emergence","degree"],"language":"en"},

The species became extinct 28,000years ago, coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) in Europe 40,000years ago. There has been considerable debate surrounding the main causes of the extinction of Neandertals. After at least 200,000years of successful adaption to the climate, flora and fauna of Eurasia, it is not clear why they suddenly failed to survive. For many years, climate change or competition with anatomically modern human (AMH) have been the leading hypotheses. Recently these hypotheses have somewhat fallen out of favour due to the recognition that Neandertals were a highly developed species with complex social structure, culture and technical skills. Were AMHs lucky and survived some catastrophe that eradicated the Neandertals? It seems unlikely that this is the case considering the close timing of the arrival of AMHs and the disappearance of Neandertals. Perhaps the arrival of AMHs also brought additional new non-human microscopic inhabitants to the regions where Neandertals lived and these new inhabitants contributed to the disappearance of the species. We introduce a medical hypothesis that complements other recent explanations for the extinction of Neandertals. After the ancestors of Neandertals left Africa, their immune system adapted gradually to the pathogens in their new Eurasian environment. In contrast, AMHs continued to co-evolve with east African pathogens. More than 200,000years later, AMHs carried pathogens that would have been alien to pre-historic Europe. First contact between long separated populations can be devastating. Recent European and American history provides evidence for similar events, where introduction of viral, protozoan or bacterial pathogens to immunologically na\u00EFve populations lead to mass mortality and local population extinction. We propose that a virus, possibly from the family Herpesviridae, contributed to Neandertal extinction.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolff, Horst; Greenwood, Alex D.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/291722931cc67a3b1721a262b95c61f71a74b62a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127019.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2010.01.048; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987710000642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20172660/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987710000642","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Neandertal"],"locations":["Portugal","Europe","Middle East","Africa"],"keyphrases":["extinction of Neandertals","disappearance of Neandertals","arrival of AMHs","Summary Neandertals","ancestors of Neandertals","AMHs lucky","new inhabitants","developed species","bacterial pathogens","Neandertal extinction","African pathogens","years of successful adaption","distinct hominoid species","northern Europe","local population extinction","additional new non-human microscopic inhabitants","new Eurasian environment","pre-historic Europe","na\u00EFve populations","climate change","recent explanations","modern humans","Middle East","leading hypotheses","long separated populations","evidence","complex social structure","vast geographical area","similar events","Portugal","introduction of viral","American history","culture","mass mortality","competition","regions","western Siberia","flora","main causes","technical skills","family Herpesviridae","close timing","immune system","fauna of Eurasia","case","considerable debate","contact","medical hypothesis","recognition","favour","catastrophe","virus","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Such evasion is related to the unstable nature of its RNA, in particular the S glycoprotein encoding gene, which raises great challenges with regard to the control of the disease, along with the lack of proof reading mechanisms of the RNA polymerase. The emergence of new variants might be a reason for the endemic outbreaks that are being reported in Tunisia, in addition to poor vaccination techniques and ineffective prophylactic programs. In the present study, partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 glycoprotein gene and the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of 2 Tunisian isolates, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16, identified in 2016, were determined. Specific mutations were found in S1 gene as well as in 3\u2032UTR region. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 nucleotide sequences showed that both isolates are closely related to the Algerian strains, and formed a common cluster within the genotype I. In addition, these isolates were non-recombinant ones, confirming that they are unique variants. Based on their S1 gene sequences, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16 strains were distant from the H120 vaccine strain, commercially used in Tunisia along with the variant vaccine 793B type (4/91). A comparison between nucleotide sequences of their 3\u2032UTR region and S1 gene showed a difference in IBV classification. The obtained results have confirmed that the IBVsequence continues to drift and brings valuable information in relation with its evolution, vaccine development and better control of the disease.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lachheb, Jihene; Turki, Aicha; Nsiri, Jihene; Fathallah, Imen; El behi, Imen; Larbi, Imen; Ghram, Abdeljelil","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a686a1b402243554843d09517e8e3f5021c2aee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107247.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119479479; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119479479; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tunisia"],"keyphrases":["S1 gene sequences","S1 nucleotide sequences","S1 glycoprotein gene","UTR region","partial nucleotide sequences","evolution","addition","vaccine development","variant vaccine","Tunisian isolates","virus evasion","TN1011","disease","TN1012","untranslated region","H120 vaccine strain","IBV classification","better control","S glycoprotein","RNA polymerase","Algerian strains","unique variants","emergence of new variants","ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis virus","poor vaccination techniques","responsible of significant economic losses","poultry industry","ineffective prophylactic programs","world","relation","lack of proof reading mechanisms","difference","inadequacy of vaccines","great challenges","reason","pathogenicity","common cluster","regard","non-recombinant ones","genotype","present study","Phylogenetic analysis","valuable information","unstable nature","IBVsequence","B type","Specific mutations","endemic outbreaks","obtained results","comparison"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory virus (RV) has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis. Objective We studied the relation between RV DNA/RNA detection in the upper/lower airways before HCT and the occurrence of allo-LSs. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all HCT recipients between 2004 and 2014, in whom real-time PCR for RV was performed in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid before HCT. The main outcome of interest was the presence of an allo-LS, which was defined as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Other outcomes were overall survival and treatment-related mortality. We used Cox proportional hazard models, logistic regression models, and Fine-Gray competing risk regression for analyses. Results One hundred seventy-nine children (median age, 6.8 years) were included. RVs were found in 61% (41% in BAL fluid/NPAs and 20% in NPAs only). Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected RV (42%). Allo-LSs occurred in 13%. RV positivity in BAL fluid was a predictor for allo-LSs (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.4-10.7; P = .01), whereas RV positivity in NPAs only was not. No other predictors were found. Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease related to steroid treatment shows a trend toward a protective effect (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.0-1.3; P = .08). Allo-LSs significantly increased treatment-related mortality (52% \u00B1 10% in allo-LSs and 20% \u00B1 4% in non\u2013allo-LSs, P = .007). Conclusions These results show that pre-HCT BAL fluid RV positivity was a predictor for allo-LSs. Screening for RVs before HCT might identify patients at risk for allo-LSs. This could have implications for prevention and treatment and might subsequently influence the outcomes of HCT.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Versluys, Birgitta; Bierings, Marc; Murk, Jean Luc; Wolfs, Tom; Lindemans, Caroline; vd Ent, Kors; Boelens, Jaap Jan","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c639bca8a2326e6c869ebfc90779610922592b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125836.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28716387/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2017.03.055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674917310990; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674917310990","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhinovirus"],"organizations":["HCT","BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["allo-LSs","occurrence of allo","outcomes of HCT","pre-HCT BAL fluid RV positivity","RV DNA","HCT recipients","detected RV","NPAs","steroid treatment","increased treatment-related mortality","hazard ratio","Results","RVs","logistic regression models","Cox proportional hazard models","odds ratio","Fine-Gray competing risk regression","idiopathic pneumonia syndrome","bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome","RNA detection","life-threatening complications","bronchoalveolar lavage","lower airways","Background Alloimmune-mediated lung syndromes","hematopoietic cell transplantation","host disease","trend","relation","nasopharyngeal aspirates","overall survival","patients","protective effect","acute graft","children","analyses","presence","median age","years","Conclusions","real-time PCR","main outcome","Grade","implications","prevention","Methods","Rhinovirus","Respiratory virus","Objective","Screening","role","pathogenesis","predictors"],"language":"en"},

S139A is a monomer that is structurally similar to the two reported monomers G11A and R298A. However, this mutant still retains a small fraction of dimer in solution, which might account for its remaining activity. F140A is a dimer with the most collapsed active pocket discovered so far, well-reflecting the stabilizing role of this residue.

The etiologic inference of identifying a pathogen in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of children with pneumonia is unclear. To determine if viral load could provide evidence of causality of pneumonia, we compared viral load in the URT of children with World Health Organization\u2013defined severe and very severe pneumonia and age-matched community controls. METHODS. In the 9 developing country sites, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from children with and without pneumonia were tested using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for 17 viruses. The association of viral load with case status was evaluated using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine optimal discriminatory viral load cutoffs. Viral load density distributions were plotted. RESULTS. The mean viral load was higher in cases than controls for 7 viruses. However, there was substantial overlap in viral load distribution of cases and controls for all viruses. ROC curves to determine the optimal viral load cutoff produced an area under the curve of \u003C0.80 for all viruses, suggesting poor to fair discrimination between cases and controls. Fatal and very severe pneumonia cases did not have higher viral load than less severe cases for most viruses. CONCLUSIONS. Although we found higher viral loads among pneumonia cases than controls for some viruses, the utility in using viral load of URT specimens to define viral pneumonia was equivocal. Our analysis was limited by lack of a gold standard for viral pneumonia.","publish_time":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feikin, Daniel R.; Fu, Wei; Park, Daniel E.; Shi, Qiyuan; Higdon, Melissa M.; Baggett, Henry C.; Brooks, W.

Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge regarding feline IFN-\u03C9 (feIFN-\u03C9), compared to IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2. In this study, we cloned the genes encoding feIFN-\u03C9a and feIFN-\u03C9b from cat spleen lymphocytes.

The recombinant feIFN-\u03C9a and feIFN-\u03C9b proteins were expressed in their soluble forms in Escherichia coli, followed by purification. Both proteins exhibited effective anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) activity in Vero, F81 (feline kidney cell), Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK), and porcine kidney (PK-15) cells, showing broader cross-species antiviral activity than the INTERCAT IFN antiviral drug. Furthermore, the recombinant feIFN-\u03C9a and feIFN-\u03C9b proteins demonstrated antiviral activity against VSV, feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine parvovirus (CPV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), indicating better broad-spectrum antiviral activity than the INTERCAT IFN.

In this 7\u2010yr follow\u2010up, risk factors for recurrent wheezing were analysed, and then, the efficacy of prednisolone was evaluated overall and in pre\u2010specified subgroups post\u2010hoc.

The membrane (M) protein genes of six PEDV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), then cloned, sequenced, and compared with each other as well as those ten PEDV reference strains. The M protein genes of six Chinese PEDV isolates consisted of 692 nucleotides containing a single open reading frame (ORF) of 681 nucleotides, which encoded a 226aa-long peptide. The conserved intergenic motif (ATAAAC), as previously recognized in Br1/87, was found in the 5 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG of M protein genes of six Chinese PEDV isolates. The hexamer motif was also found in CV777, JMe2, LZC, and QH. The M protein of six isolates had three main transmembrane domains (aa20\u201338, aa43\u201365, aa75\u201397). The M protein of one isolate, CH/IMT/06, had one potential glycosylation site, but those of the other five isolates had two. The glycosylation sequence Asn-Phe-Thr was highly conserved in the M proteins of six PEDV isolates. The six PEDV isolates showed nucleotide sequence homology between 98.8 and 100% and deduced amino acid sequence homology between 98.2 and 100% with each other. The nucleotide and amino acid identity of M protein genes between the six PEDV isolates and ten reference PEDV strains varied from 97.2 to 99.4% and 96.9 to 100%, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic relationship of M protein genes, six Chinese PEDV isolates composed of a separate cluster including one Chinese strain JS-2004-02, however, not including the Chinese strain LJB/03. These results demonstrated that there was a new genotype of PEDV prevailing in China.","publish_time":"2008-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jian-Fei; Sun, Dong-Bo; Wang, Cheng-Bao; Shi, Hong-Yan; Cui, Xiao-Chen; Liu, Sheng-Wang; Qiu, Hua-Ji; Feng, Li","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65aa3582228494a073cd4cd7f8879ee14ca79a1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088904.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-007-0196-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18214664/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","QH"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Chinese PEDV isolates","protein genes","PEDV reference strains","reference PEDV strains","new genotype of PEDV","nucleotides","Chinese strain JS","Chinese strain LJB","nucleotide sequence homology","deduced amino acid sequence homology","China","glycosylation sequence Asn-Phe","amino acid identity","conserved intergenic motif","hexamer motif","potential glycosylation site","reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","separate cluster","single open reading frame","PEDVs","ORF","Thr","main transmembrane domains","RT-PCR","porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses","aa20","CV777","phylogenetic relationship","initiator ATG","fecal samples of piglets","JMe2","LZC","IMT","aa43","ATAAAC","proteins","aa-long peptide","QH","basis","aa75","results","Br1"],"language":"en"},

Both phenotypic and functional activities of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated by GA were assessed. Our results showed that GA obviously increased the cell surface expression of CD80, CD86, and MHCII molecules. Meanwhile, GA upregulated the expression of CCR7 and the production of TNF-\u03B1, IL-12, IL-6, and NO (the markers of classically activated (M1) macrophages), whereas it downregulated the expression of MR, Ym1, and Arg1 (the markers of alternatively activated (M2) macrophage). The functional tests showed that GA dramatically enhanced the uptake of FITC-dextran and E. coli K88 by BMDMs and decreased the intracellular survival of E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium. Moreover, we demonstrated that JNK and NF-\u03BAB activation are required for GA-induced NO and M1-related cytokines production, while ERK1/2 pathway exhibits a regulatory effect via induction of IL-10. Together, these findings indicated that GA promoted polarization of M1 macrophages and enhanced its phagocytosis and bactericidal capacity.

The aim of this review was to gather fragmented literature on ethnomedicinal plants used against bronchitis in the Himalayan region and their in\u2010vitro validation against bronchitis causing viral pathogens. KEY FINDINGS: Present review contains ethnomedicines of total 55 plants from different countries of the Himalayas. Most of the literature reported was from India followed by Pakistan, China and Nepal. Familiarly used plant families for bronchitis treatment in the Himalayan region were Leguminosae (six plants) and Lamiaceae (five plants). Leaves and roots were the most common parts used in ethnomedicines against bronchitis. Of these 55 plants, only six plants have been studied in vitro against viral pathogens causing bronchitis. Different compounds like monoterpenoids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, iridoid glycosides, sesquiterpenes, benzoic and phenolic compounds were reportedly isolated from these plant extracts having strong antiviral potential. SUMMARY: The Himalayan regions possess variety of ethnomedicinal plants used against respiratory diseases, but still there are only few studies related with their in\u2010vitro validation. We invite the attention of researchers for detailed ethnopharmacological and phytochemical studies on unexplored plants used to treat bronchitis for the development of novel antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amber, Rahila; Adnan, Muhammad; Tariq, Akash; Mussarat, Sakina","journal":"J Pharm Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdb193145fe9ab4764d0b0b4745d4a68a72feb70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166987.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27905101/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jphp.12669","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Himalayan","Himalayas","India","China"],"keyphrases":["unexplored plants","bronchitis treatment","variety of ethnomedicinal plants","Himalayan regions","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory diseases","Different compounds","vitro validation","viral pathogens","common respiratory tract infection of humans","ethnomedicines of total","common parts","influenza virus","phenolic compounds","plant extracts","Present review","phytochemical studies","plant families","different countries","fragmented literature","strong antiviral potential","development of novel antiviral drugs","adenovirus","detailed ethnopharmacological","iridoid glycosides","sesquiterpenes","triterpenoids","flavonoids","coronavirus","monoterpenoids","rhinovirus","Leguminosae","attention of researchers","KEY FINDINGS","Pakistan","China","India","roots","SUMMARY","Himalayas","OBJECTIVES","Lamiaceae","Nepal","Leaves","aim"],"language":"en"},

Because no licensed MERS-CoV vaccines are currently available, preventive and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. The surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV, which binds to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is considered as a major target for MERS-CoV vaccine development. Here, we designed recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the N-terminal domain (rAd/NTD) and receptor-binding domain (rAd/RBD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit and full-length Spike protein (rAd/Spike). We found that immunization with candidate vaccines via intranasal route induced S1-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against MERS spike pseudotyped virus. Especially, rAd/Spike induced the highest neutralizing antibody titer and the strongest cytokine-induced T cell responses among the three candidate vaccines. To compare the immune responses induced by different administration routes, rAd/Spike was administered via intranasal, sublingual, or intramuscular route. All these administration routes exhibited neutralizing effects in the serum. MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing IgA antibodies in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were only induced by intranasal and sublingual administration but not by intramuscular administration. Intranasal administration with rAd/Spike also created resident memory CD8 T cells in the airway and lung parenchyma. Taken together, our results showed that both the humoral and cellular immune responses are highly induced by rAd/Spike administration, suggesting that rAd/Spike may confer protection against MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2019-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Myung Hee; Kim, Hyun Jik; Chang, Jun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7aaffdb8cf80ab9dd167a26a44abfa21d30d2af5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6645677.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["rAd/Spike","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Spike administration","MERS-CoV infection","licensed MERS-CoV vaccines","surface spike","Intranasal administration","MERS spike pseudotyped virus","MERS-CoV S1 subunit","glycoprotein of MERS","MERS-CoV vaccine development","sublingual administration","intramuscular administration","full-length Spike protein","neutralizing antibodies","candidate vaccines","different administration routes","intranasal route induced S1-specific IgG antibodies","specific neutralizing IgA antibodies","neutralizing effects","strongest cytokine-induced T cell responses","cellular immune responses","intramuscular route","highest neutralizing antibody titer","receptor-binding domain","recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccines","cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase","N-terminal domain","severe lower respiratory illness","resident memory CD8 T cells","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","vomiting","airway","NTD","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","RBD","protection","major target","diarrhea","DPP4","immunization","lung parenchyma","renal failure","therapeutic measures","serum","results"],"language":"en"},

The studies examined PPE use in hospital (n = 7), dental (n = 4) or laboratory (n = 2) settings. Policies and practices on PPE use were inconsistent. Face masks and gloves were the most commonly used PPE to protect from respiratory and other infections. PPE was not available in many facilities and its use was limited to high-risk situations. Compliance with PPE use was low among healthcare workers, and reuse of PPE was reported. Clear policies on the use of PPE and available PPE are needed to avoid inappropriate practices that could result in the spread of infection. Large, multimethod studies are recommended on PPE use to inform national infection-control guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Khan, Wasiq","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13d7e666278bc140b1312db4b3018e3c73c90784.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102706.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32146139/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.02.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120303634; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120303634","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","Goggle Scholar"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPE use","available PPE","reuse of PPE","used PPE","multimethod studies","cross-sectional studies","laboratory-based studies","use of personal protective equipment","systematic review of studies","healthcare settings","respiratory infections","Pakistan","healthcare workers","limited data","inappropriate practices","Clear policies","spread of infection","national infection-control guidelines","Goggle Scholar","low-income countries","gloves","English","hospital","MEDLINE","Embase","Compliance","facilities","Face masks","high-risk situations"],"language":"en"},

Methods Clinical follow-up, adherence to preventive measures and PCR-based pharyngeal bacterial carriage pre- and post-Hajj, were assessed in a cohort of 119 French Hajj pilgrims. Results 55% had an indication for pneumococcal vaccination. Occurrence of respiratory symptoms was 76.5%, with cough (70.6%) and sore throat (44.5%) being the most frequent; fever was reported by 38.7% pilgrims and 42.0% took antibiotics. Respiratory symptoms, fever and antibiotic intake were significantly more frequent in pilgrims with indication for vaccination against pneumococcal infection. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage (1.8% pre-, 9.8% post-Hajj), H. influenzae carriage (0.9%, 45.4%) and K. pneumoniae (2.8%, 9.8%) significantly increased post-Hajj. Pilgrims vaccinated with conjugate pneumococcal vaccine were seven time less likely to present S. pneumoniae carriage post-Hajj compared to those not vaccinated (3.2% vs. 18.0%, OR = 0.15; 95% CI [0.03\u20130.74], p = 0.02). Conclusions Pilgrims at risk for pneumococcal disease are more likely to suffer from febrile respiratory symptoms at the Hajj despite being immunized against pneumococcal disease and despite lowered S. pneumoniae carriage and should be targeted for reinforced prevention against respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoang, Van-Thuan; Meftah, Mohammed; Anh Ly, Tran Duc; Drali, Tassadit; Yezli, Saber; Alotaibi, Badriah; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe; Pommier de Santi, Vincent; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7417f8648801d0febf4227d4bb0c4c45483d3fbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110955.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30415081/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893918303855; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893918303855; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2018.10.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae","K. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumoniae carriage post-Hajj","French Hajj pilgrims","pneumococcal disease","respiratory infections","pneumococcal vaccination","Conclusions Pilgrims","influenzae carriage","pneumococcal infection","febrile respiratory symptoms","Occurrence of respiratory symptoms","conjugate pneumococcal vaccine","pharyngeal bacterial carriage pre-","indication","fever","Abstract Background Viral respiratory tract infections","preventive measures","PCR","adherence","time","antibiotic intake","risk","Methods Clinical follow-up","role of bacteria","cohort","reinforced prevention","cough","prevalence","sore throat","Results","antibiotics"],"language":"en"},

Autophagy also plays an important part in virus infection and propagation. However, some pathogens, including viruses, have evolved unique trick to escape or exploit autophagy. This study explores the mechanism of autophagy induction by porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in Neuro-2a cells, and examines the role of autophagy in PHEV replication. PHEV triggered autophagy in Neuro-2a cells is dependent on the presence of bulk double- or single-membrane vacuoles, the accumulation of GFP-LC3 fluorescent dots, and the LC3 lipidation. In addition, PHEV induced an incomplete autophagic effect because the degradation level of p62 did not change in PHEV-infected cells. Further validation was captured using LysoTracker and lysosome-associated membrane protein by indirect immunofluorescence labeling in PHEV-infected cells. We also investigated the change in viral replication by pharmacological experiments with the autophagy inducer rapamycin or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Suppression of autophagy by 3-MA increased viral replication, compared with the mock treatment, while promoting of autophagy by rapamycin reduced PHEV replication. CQ treatment enhanced the LC3 lipidation in PHEV-infected Neuro-2a cells but lowered PHEV replication. These results show that PHEV infection induces atypical autophagy and causes the appearance of autophagosomes but blocks the fusion with lysosomes, which is necessary for the replication of PHEV in nerve cells.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Ning; Zhao, Kui; Lan, Yungang; Li, Zi; Lv, Xiaoling; Su, Jingjing; Lu, Huijun; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4b7ab00946639c33eebee571e31d74e2543de95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5328988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293544/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Autophagy","PHEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of PHEV","PHEV triggered autophagy","PHEV-infected cells","autophagy inhibitor","PHEV infection","atypical autophagy","role of autophagy","Suppression of autophagy","lowered PHEV replication","PHEV-infected Neuro","autophagy inducer rapamycin","mechanism of autophagy induction","viral replication","nerve cells","LC3 lipidation","virus infection","CQ treatment","change","intracellular membrane transport pathways","lysosome-associated membrane protein","single-membrane vacuoles","LC3 fluorescent dots","intracellular microorganisms","mock treatment","lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine","porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","indirect immunofluorescence","pharmacological experiments","cellular components","accumulation of GFP","basic biological metabolic process","incomplete autophagic effect","presence of bulk double","LysoTracker","degradation level of p62","fusion","appearance of autophagosomes","viruses","lysosomes","propagation","unique trick","addition","study","results","validation","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, we searched for effects of SARS-CoV-2 and of other coronaviridae on insulin secretion and glycemia. Results SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a risk factor for complications in pregnancy. Corticosteroids may not be recommended for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia but they may be needed for at-risk pregnancies. Corticosteroids in pregnancy have a diabetogenic potential.

We sampled surfaces during the Hajj to detect the presence of respiratory bacteria and viruses. Methods Frequently touched surfaces at Mecca, Mina, Arafat and Medina were sampled. The common respiratory pathogens were tested by qPCR. Results 70/142 (49.3%) environmental samples collected were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Among the positive samples, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the bacterium most frequently tested positive (57.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.1%). 32.9% positive samples tested positive for rhinovirus and 1.4% for coronavirus. Surfaces with the highest rates of positive samples were kitchen tables (100%), water fountain faucet (73.3%) and edge of water coolers lid (84.6%). Samples collected in Mina were the most frequently contaminated with 68.8% being positive for at least one pathogen and 18.8% positive for a combination of multiple pathogens.

While there are widespread reports of intentional reductions in elective hospitalizations, trends in urgent or emergent hospitalizations including heart failure (HF) hospitalizations have not been adequately characterized. METHODS: We evaluated trends of HF hospitalizations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Mississippi Medical Center using electronic health records and discharge database. We also compared HF hospitalization trends during the same time frame in 2019 to account for seasonal variation in HF presentations. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our medical center, a mean of 30 patients per week were admitted with a principal diagnosis of HF. After the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Mississippi, there was a sharp 50% decline in the number of HF hospitalizations that declined even further after a \u201Cstate of emergency\u201D was declared in Mississippi. CONCLUSIONS: Based on observations from a large academic medical center, there has been a significant reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for HF during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further investigation of these trends is warranted to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term HF outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"HALL, MICHAEL E.; VADUGANATHAN, MUTHIAH; KHAN, MUHAMMAD SHAHZEB; PAPADIMITRIOU, LAMPROS; LONG, ROBERT C.; HERNANDEZ, GABRIEL A.; MOORE, CHARLES K.; LENNEP, BRANDON W.; MCMULLAN, MICHAEL R.; BUTLER, JAVED","journal":"J Card Fail","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef5f81ea3c369b1fa1c5aaed64c060ce2618bf2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219367.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405232/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420304693?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.05.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420304693","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mississippi"],"keyphrases":["trends of HF hospitalizations","number of HF hospitalizations","pandemic","HF hospitalization trends","HF presentations","elective hospitalizations","case of COVID","non-emergent hospitalizations","long-term HF outcomes","University of Mississippi Medical Center","large academic medical center","number of patients","subsequent reductions","widespread reports of intentional reductions","electronic health records","healthcare systems","account","heart failure","observations","time frame","burden","discharge database","seasonal variation","week","mean","procedures","decline","significant reduction","coronavirus disease","effects","principal diagnosis of","BACKGROUND","METHODS","state of emergency","CONCLUSIONS","investigation","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although SG formation is inducible due to cellular stress, PB exist physiologically in every cell. Both RNA granules are important components of the host antiviral defense. Virus infection imposes stress on host cells and thus induces SG formation. However, both RNA and DNA viruses must confront the hostile environment of host innate immunity and apply various strategies to block the formation of SG and PB for their effective infection and multiplication.

All the membranes were characterized for their physical and chemical properties before being tested. It was also found that at Al2O3 concentrations higher than 8%, nanofibers could not be formed by the pure blending and electrospinning technique. The antibacterial activity of the membranes proved that silver incorporation provided suitable disinfection with greater than 99.5% antibacterial efficiency for all membranes. The antibacterial efficiency of the membranes was maintained even as the concentration of Al2O3 was increased. The hydrolysis of paraoxon, a nerve agent simulant, for the prepared membranes was also studied. The removal of paraoxon was found to increase as the loaded concentration of Al2O3 in the membrane increased. The particulate filtration efficiency of the prepared membranes was tested using particles of diameter 0.36\u03BCm. Compared to the nascent PVDF nanofiber membranes with particle filtration efficiency of 94%, the Ag and Al2O3 loaded membranes all had a higher particle filtration efficiency. Interestingly, it was found that as the concentration of Al2O3 loaded in the membranes increased so did the particle filtration efficiency. Membrane characterization data revealed that as the concentration of the Al2O3 was increased, the average pore size of the membrane was reduced and the thickness of the filter mat increased. This would explain the higher retention of the particles by these filters. Correspondingly, the resistance of the filters also increased as more Al2O3 was loaded in the nanofiber membranes. The synthesized nanofibrous membranes have the potential to be used as 3 in 1 highly efficient air filters.","publish_time":"2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vanangamudi, Anbharasi; Hamzah, Sakinah; Singh, Gurdev","journal":"Chemical Engineering Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26771ab6c966eda350aaa12853c7c85164d981ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108431.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288624/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2014.08.062; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1385894714011164; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894714011164","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prepared membranes","Al2O3 nanofibrous air filtration membranes","loaded concentration of Al2O3","synthesized nanofibrous membranes","antibacterial efficiency","particulate filtration efficiency","Al2O3 concentrations higher","higher particle filtration efficiency","nascent PVDF nanofiber membranes","different concentrations of Al2O3","particulate filtration efficiencies","fixed concentration of Ag","antibacterial activity","higher retention","efficient air filters","Membrane characterization data","electrospinning method","electrospinning technique","particles of diameter","hydrolysis of paraoxon","removal of paraoxon","Abstract Hybrid hydrophobic composite PVDF","silver incorporation","nerve agent simulant","suitable disinfection","average pore size","detoxification ability","pure blending","thickness","potential","filter mat","chemical properties","\u03BCm","nanofibers","resistance"],"language":"en"},

It is a demyelinating disease affecting mainly the white matter of the cerebellum and areas adjacent to the fourth ventricle; the enzymes of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) group, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9 have a key role in the myelin basic protein fragmentation and in demyelination, as well as in leukocyte traffic into the nervous milieu. To evaluate the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis, we measured the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by zymography in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the cerebellum of 14 dogs naturally infected with CDV and 10 uninfected dogs. The infected dogs presented high levels of pro-MMP-2 in the CSF and elevated levels of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 in the cerebellar tissue. Active MMP-2 was detected in the CSF of some infected dogs. As active MMP-2 and MMP-9 are required for cellular migration across the blood\u2013brain barrier and any interference between MMPs and their inhibitors may result in an amplification of demyelination, this study gives additional support to the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis and suggests that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may take part in the brain inflammatory changes of this disease.","publish_time":"2013-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Machado, Gisele F.; Melo, Guilherme D.; Souza, Milena S.; Machado, Andressa A.; Migliolo, Daniela S.; Moraes, Ol\u00EDvia C.; Nunes, C\u00E1ris M.; Ribeiro, \u00C9rica S.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6467f41212c1ffc9db577146f1ba7e49063f961.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127742.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242713001268; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242713001268; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV","CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of MMP","Active MMP","high levels of pro-MMP","elevated levels of pro-MMP","involvement of MMPs","subacute distemper leukoencephalitis","CSF","uninfected dogs","canine distemper virus","demyelinating disease","CDV","cerebellum","brain barrier","amplification of demyelination","brain inflammatory changes","myelin basic protein fragmentation","white matter","key role","blood","study","interference","additional support","areas adjacent","matrix metalloproteinases","ventricle","enzymes","cellular migration","infection","zymography","group","leukocyte traffic","nervous milieu","cerebrospinal fluid","inhibitors","cerebellar tissue"],"language":"en"},

However, understanding additional characteristics that predict disease outbreaks and uncovering landscape factors related to between-farm spread are crucial steps toward risk mitigation. This study integrates animal movements with environmental risk factors to identify the occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks. Using weekly farm-level incidence data from 332 sow farms, we applied machine-learning algorithms to quantify associations between risk factors and PEDV outbreaks with the ultimate goal of training predictive models and to identify the most important factors associated with PEDV occurrence. Our best algorithm was able to correctly predict whether an outbreak occurred during one-week periods with \u003E80% accuracy. The most important predictors included pig movements into neighboring farms. Other important neighborhood attributes included hog density, environmental and weather factors such as vegetation, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation, and topographical features such as slope. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to simultaneously capture disease risks associated with long-distance animal movement as well as local spatial dynamics. The model presented here forms the foundation for near real-time disease mapping and will advance disease surveillance and control for endemic swine pathogens in the United States.","publish_time":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Machado, Gustavo; Vilalta, Carles; Recamonde-Mendoza, Mariana; Corzo, Cesar; Torremorell, Montserrat; Perez, Andrez; VanderWaal, Kimberly","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47654cf27ea49e075f800ff503bbeecb4168e224.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6345879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679594/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36934-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["important factors","disease outbreaks","environmental risk factors","weather factors","PEDV outbreaks","disease surveillance","disease risks","animal movements","PEDV occurrence","uncovering landscape factors","real-time disease mapping","risk mitigation","farm spread","spread of pathogens","pig movements","sow farms","neighboring farms","important predictors","important neighborhood attributes","movements of animals","endemic swine pathogens","swine populations","long-distance animal movement","neighborhood-based approach","occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","weekly farm-level incidence data","hog density","associations","vegetation","wind speed","ultimate goal of training predictive models","precipitation","temperature","machine-learning algorithms","crucial steps","control","local spatial dynamics","foundation","United States","study","topographical features","additional characteristics","week periods","best algorithm","accuracy","slope"],"language":"en"},

Patients with severe COVID-19 infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension. Almost 75% of patients who have died in the pandemic in Italy had hypertension. This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury. We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk.

A complete cDNA clone of a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) DI RNA, NE-1, containing a single nucleotide deletion in the 5\u2032 region of the ORF was obtained and analyzed. Due to this single nucleotide deletion, a DI-specific protein of 7.5-kDa was made from NE-1, in contrast to the 88-kDa protein made from the wild-type DI RNA. NE-1 RNA was efficiently replicated after transfection into MHV-infected cells. However, after one passage of NE-1 RNA-containing virus, the 88-kDa wild-type protein was synthesized, indicating that the large ORF was restored during NE-1 DI RNA replication. Sequence analysis of NE-1 DI RNA from infected cells demonstrated that in approximately half of the DI RNA population, the ORF was restored by RNA recombination between NE-1 DI RNA and helper virus genomic sequence. The sequences of other DI RNAs contained an additional nontemplated A\u0331 at the five-A\u0331 sequence nine nucleotides upstream of the deletion site, resulting in a stretch of six consecutive A\u0331 s. In these \u0022edited\u0022-type DI RNAs, the original nucleotide deletion was maintained and no RNA recombination was observed. This \u0022editing\u0022 produced an ORF of the same size as the wild-type DI RNA. We conclude that the DI RNA with a large ORF has a selective advantage. There was no significant difference in replication efficiency among these RNAs when they replicated alone. However, cotransfection of two DI RNA species and time course experiments suggested that homologous interference and other mechanism(s) during the early stage of virus multiplication are responsible for the accumulation of DI RNAs containing the large ORF.","publish_time":"1993-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Young-Nam; Lai, Michael M.C.; Makino, Shinji","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283712559; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283712559","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A\u0331 s."],"organizations":["DI","ORF","DI RNA","RNA","DI RNAs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DI RNA replication","DI RNA species","DI RNA population","DI RNA-specific protein","wild-type DI RNA","type DI RNAs","DI-specific protein","RNA recombination","accumulation of DI RNAs","large ORF","kDa protein","passage of NE","kDa wild-type protein","Sequence analysis of NE","A\u0331 sequence","single nucleotide deletion","original nucleotide deletion","deletion site","helper virus genomic sequence","mouse hepatitis virus","consecutive A\u0331","MHV-infected cells","early stage of virus multiplication","additional nontemplated A\u0331","replication efficiency","time course experiments","homologous interference","coronavirus defective interfering","half","complete cDNA clone","mechanism","stretch","nucleotides","size","significance","open reading frame","significant difference","Abstract","selective advantage","region","contrast","cotransfection","function","sequences","editing"],"language":"en"},

Exposure to this powerful oxidizing agent can cause or exacerbate many lung conditions, especially those involving innate immunity. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) plays many roles in innate immunity by participating directly in host defense as it exerts opsonin function, or indirectly via its ability to regulate alveolar macrophages and other innate immune cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for ozone-induced pathophysiology, while likely related to oxidative stress, are not well understood. METHODS: We employed 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a discovery proteomics approach, coupled with MALDI-ToF/ToF to compare the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomes in wild type (WT) and SP-A knockout (KO) mice and to assess the impact of ozone or filtered air on the expression of BAL proteins. Using the PANTHER database and the published literature most identified proteins were placed into three functional groups. RESULTS: We identified 66 proteins and focused our analysis on these proteins. Many of them fell into three categories: defense and immunity; redox regulation; and protein metabolism, modification and chaperones. In response to the oxidative stress of acute ozone exposure (2 ppm; 3 hours) there were many significant changes in levels of expression of proteins in these groups. Most of the proteins in the redox group were decreased, the proteins involved in protein metabolism increased, and roughly equal numbers of increases and decreases were seen in the defense and immunity group. Responses between WT and KO mice were similar in many respects. However, the percent change was consistently greater in the KO mice and there were more changes that achieved statistical significance in the KO mice, with levels of expression in filtered air-exposed KO mice being closer to ozone-exposed WT mice than to filtered air-exposed WT mice. CONCLUSION: We postulate that SP-A plays a role in reactive oxidant scavenging in WT mice and that its absence in the KO mice in the presence or absence of ozone exposure results in more pronounced, and presumably chronic, oxidative stress.","publish_time":"2009-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haque, Rizwanul; Umstead, Todd M; Freeman, Willard M; Floros, Joanna; Phelps, David S","journal":"Proteome Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/844b876f1636f5d031fe856cd7a63ae5f5c11fe7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2666657.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-7-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19323824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ozone-exposed WT mice","air-exposed WT mice","filtered air-exposed KO mice","identified proteins","expression of BAL proteins","impact of ozone","innate immunity","absence of ozone exposure results","oxidative stress of acute ozone exposure","immunity group","ozone-induced pathophysiology","levels of expression","protein metabolism","host defense","redox group","Surfactant protein","major component of air pollution","innate immune cells","redox regulation","MALDI-ToF","significant changes","functional groups","D-DIGE","proteomes","presence","wild type","alveolar macrophages","bronchoalveolar lavage","published literature","dimensional difference gel electrophoresis","discovery proteomics approach","equal numbers of increases","decreases","modification","hours","ppm","reactive oxidant","statistical significance","knockout","PANTHER database","opsonin function","powerful oxidizing agent","ability","mechanism","BACKGROUND","lung conditions","chaperones","categories","roles","respects","Responses","percent change","analysis","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

As a first line of defense against respiratory infections, innate immune responses, including the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs), play an important role. Upon infection with RSV, multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize RSV-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount innate immune responses. Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) have been identified as important innate receptors to mount type I IFNs during RSV infection. However, type I IFN levels remain surprisingly low during RSV infection despite strong viral replication. The poor induction of type I IFNs can be attributed to the cooperative activity of 2 unique, nonstructural (NS) proteins of RSV, i.e., NS1 and NS2. These viral proteins have been shown to suppress both the production and signaling of type I and III IFNs by counteracting a plethora of key host innate signaling proteins. Moreover, increasing numbers of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are being identified as targets of the NS proteins in recent years, highlighting an underexplored protein family in the identification of NS target proteins. To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of NS1 was resolved recently and, remarkably, identified NS1 as a structural paralogue of the RSV matrix protein. Unfortunately, no structural data on NS2 have been published so far. In this review, we briefly describe the PRRs that mount innate immune responses upon RSV infection and provide an overview of the various effector functions of NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, we discuss the ubiquitination effector functions of NS1 and NS2, which are in line with the hypothesis that the NSD shares features with the canonical 26S proteasome.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sedeyn, Koen; Schepens, Bert; Saelens, Xavier","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/712c86986815982dc6d918b660f70f5e05616643.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6797084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622448/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007984","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III","Goswami"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteins of RSV","RSV infection","NS2","NS proteins","RSV matrix protein","IFNs","innate immune responses","various effector functions of NS1","diverse effector functions of NS1","ubiquitination effector functions of NS1","viral proteins","production of type","RSV-derived pathogen","important innate receptors","crystal structure of NS1","identification of NS target proteins","NS degradasome","poor induction of type","respiratory infections","PRRs","hypothesis","important role","underexplored protein family","important cause of acute lower respiratory tract disease","Human respiratory syncytial virus","structural paralogue","IFN levels","multiprotein complex","numbers of IFN","line of defense","structural data","NSD shares features","strong viral replication","multiple pattern recognition receptors","PAMPs","recent years","infants","molecular patterns","Goswami","overview","colleagues","nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain","inducible gene","stimulated genes","ISGs","targets","plethora of key host","S proteasome","cooperative activity","Retinoic-acid","RIG","NOD2","interferons","review"],"language":"en"},

The most common methods in use, based on coalescent inference, have been widely used but not extensively tested against simulated epidemics. Here, we use simulated data to test the ability of both parametric and non-parametric methods for inference of effective population size (coded in the popular BEAST package) to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. We consider a range of simulations centred on scenarios considered plausible for pandemic influenza, but our conclusions are generic for any exponentially growing epidemic. We highlight systematic biases in non-parametric effective population size estimation. The most prominent such bias leads to the false inference of slowing of epidemic spread in the recent past even when the real epidemic is growing exponentially. We suggest some sampling strategies that could reduce (but not eliminate) some of the biases. Parametric methods can correct for these biases if the infected population size is large. We also explore how some poor sampling strategies (e.g. that over-represent epidemiologically linked clusters of cases) could dramatically exacerbate bias in an uncontrolled manner. Finally, we present a simple diagnostic indicator, based on coalescent density and which can easily be applied to reconstructed phylogenies, that identifies time-periods for which effective population size estimates are less likely to be biased. We illustrate this with an application to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.","publish_time":"2012-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Silva, Eric; Ferguson, Neil M.; Fraser, Christophe","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72ddf8d0c71b8b1ece743904f2acd2c1a00984c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3385754.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2011.0850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22337627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inference of effective population size","population dynamics","infected population size","effective population size estimates","non-parametric effective population size estimation","non-parametric methods","epidemic dynamics","growing epidemic","coalescent inference","epidemic spread","real epidemic","false inference","systematic biases","common methods","simulated data","use","poor sampling strategies","pandemic influenza","bias leads","coalescent density","H1N1 pandemic","sequence data","simulated epidemics","time-periods","scenarios","increasing role","recent past","ability","popular BEAST package","conclusions","simple diagnostic indicator","linked clusters of cases","analysis of outbreaks","range of simulations","reconstructed phylogenies","application","uncontrolled manner"],"language":"en"},

Using hedonic pricing models, this study has found that different distributions between private and shared space command different values from the housing buyers. Shared communal space generally exerts a downward pressure on housing prices. The buyers are willing to pay more for the private space and some desirable forms of communal space. A higher willingness-to-pay for the desirable attributes such as clubhouse indicates that the Hong Kong people are increasingly concerned about the quality of living space in the built environment. This study suggests a need of further research into the exact measurement and the different forms of housing space rather than simply taking the stated floor space figures for granted.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Edwin Hon-Wan; So, Hing-Mei; Tang, Bo-Sin; Wong, Wah-Sang","journal":"Habitat International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8c66b9406659a7b14d36d3dcd1e7cf83dc0c8d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124225.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287694/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397507000690; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397507000690; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2007.11.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["private space","internal space","public space","Shared communal space","different forms of housing space","quality of living space","desirable forms of communal space","shared space command different values","stated floor space figures","private housing prices","housing buyers","Housing floor area","different distributions","exploratory study","Hong Kong people","desirable attributes","ambiguous concept","relationship","downward pressure","clubhouse","exact measurement","research","unidentifiable portion","built environment","hedonic pricing models","need","possible exaggeration","owners","higher willingness","development"],"language":"en"},

This review presents recent developments in theory, techniques, and applications of RT-PCR in food analyses, RT-PCR addresses the limitations of traditional food analyses in terms of sensitivity, range of analytes, multiplexing ability, cost, time, and point-of-care applications.

A recent study reported that Klebsiella pneumonia NDM-1 positive strain or Escherichia coli NDM-1 positive strain was highly resistant to all antibiotics tested except tigecycline and colistin. These can no longer be relied on to treat infections and therefore, NDM-1 now becomes potentially a major global health threat. In this study, we performed modeling studies to obtain its 3D structure and NDM-1/antibiotics complex. It revealed that the hydrolytic mechanisms are highly conserved. In addition, the detailed analysis indicates that the more flexible and hydrophobic loop1, together with the evolution of more positive-charged loop2 leads to NDM-1 positive strain more potent and extensive in antibiotics resistance compared with other MBLs. Furthermore, through biological experiments, we revealed the molecular basis for antibiotics catalysis of NDM-1 on the enzymatic level. We found that NDM-1 enzyme was highly potent to degrade carbapenem antibiotics, while mostly susceptible to tigecycline, which had the ability to slow down the hydrolysis velocity of meropenem by NDM-1. Meanwhile, the mutagenesis experiments, including D124A, C208A, K211A and K211E, which displayed down-regulation on meropenem catalysis, proved the accuracy of our model. At present, there are no effective antibiotics against NDM-1 positive pathogen. Our study will provide clues to investigate the molecular basis of extended antibiotics resistance of NDM-1 and then accelerate the search for new antibiotics against NDM-1 positive strain in clinical studies.","publish_time":"2011-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Zhongjie; Li, Lianchun; Wang, Yuanyuan; Chen, Limin; Kong, Xiangqian; Hong, Yao; Lan, Lefu; Zheng, Mingyue; Guang-Yang, Cai; Liu, Hong; Shen, Xu; Luo, Cheng; Li, Keqin Kathy; Chen, Kaixian; Jiang, Hualiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bbaed357d3aa8c39af2508fb1ca775f8708ec41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3161043.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibiotics catalysis of NDM","positive strain","new antibiotics","Escherichia coli NDM","Klebsiella pneumonia NDM","molecular basis of extended antibiotics resistance of NDM","carbapenem antibiotics","effective antibiotics","antibiotics complex","positive pathogen","meropenem catalysis","tigecycline","recent study","clinical studies","modeling studies","mutagenesis experiments","biological experiments","hydrolysis velocity of meropenem","New Delhi Metallo-\u03B2","D124A","C208A","lactamase","K211E","evolution","D structure","loop2","detailed analysis","major global health threat","hydrophobic loop1","K211A","ability","accuracy","regulation","clues","enzyme","search","hydrolytic mechanisms","addition","present","enzymatic level","colistin","MBLs","Swedish patient","infections"],"language":"en"},

The problems of the infections are exacerbated by rapid transmission of the pathogenic agents, which occur through inhalation and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Moreover, cross-species transmission resulting from changes to viral genetic makeup poses a risk for emergence of pathogens with new characteristics, which in some cases may be responsible for causing different diseases. With the advent of efficient sequencing and nucleic acid-based virus-disabling technologies, gene therapy is well placed to advance new treatments to counter respiratory infections. Most studies aimed at using nucleic acids to treat respiratory viral infections have used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence viral gene targets. A few studies have used silencing of host factors required by the viruses as a means of inhibiting viral replication and preventing emergence of escape mutants. By administering antivirals to the airways, studies performed in vivo have taken advantage of the anatomy of the respiratory system to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids. Reported data have shown proof of principle of efficacy of gene therapy in models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza virus A, and measles virus, among others. RNAi-based gene therapy has been advanced to clinical trial for treatment of RSV infection. Although the primary endpoint was not met in an intent-to-treat analysis, the investigation has provided useful information for the advancement of gene therapy for current and emergent respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arbuthnot, Patrick","journal":"Gene Therapy for Viral Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e756fc41bf3b1f3b95f9bc32f82eb725210ccfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149684.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124105188000090; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124105188000090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viral infections","emergent respiratory infections","respiratory system","advancement of gene therapy","efficacy of gene therapy","viral gene targets","RNAi-based gene therapy","models of respiratory syncytial virus","studies","influenza virus","nucleic acid-based virus","measles virus","viral replication","Abstract Pulmonary infections","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","viral genetic makeup","therapeutic nucleic acids","viruses","emergence of pathogens","rapid transmission","new characteristics","new treatments","different diseases","treatment of RSV infection","emergence of escape mutants","cross-species transmission","serious diseases of public health importance","inhalation","changes","risk","clinical trial","RNA interference","advent of efficient sequencing","useful information","technologies","proof of principle","direct contact","contaminated surfaces","cases","pathogenic agents","silencing of host factors","analysis","investigation","anatomy","means","advantage","intent","data","antivirals","airways","primary endpoint","problems"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological surveillance has highlighted an overwhelming occurrence of the highly pathogenic fungus Sporothrix brasiliensis during feline outbreaks, leading to massive transmissions to humans. Early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by demonstrating the presence of a surrogate marker of infection can have a key role for selecting appropriate disease control measures and minimizing zoonotic transmission to humans. METHODOLOGY: We explored the presence and diversity of serum antibodies (IgG) specific against Sporothrix antigens in cats with sporotrichosis and evaluated the utility of these antibodies for serodiagnosis. Antigen profiling included protein extracts from the closest known relatives S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting enabled us to characterize the major antigens of feline sporotrichosis from sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 49), healthy cats (n = 19), and cats with other diseases (n = 20). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-Sporothrix IgG exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in cats with sporotrichosis (area under the curve, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.94\u20131; P\u003C0.0001) versus controls. The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents. One-dimensional immunoblotting indicated that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (a 60-kDa protein in S. brasiliensis and a 70-kDa protein in S. schenckii) is the immunodominant antigen in feline sporotrichosis. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed six IgG-reactive isoforms of gp60 in the S. brasiliensis proteome, similar to the humoral response found in human sporotrichosis. CONCLUSIONS: A convergent IgG-response in various hosts (mice, cats, and humans) has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of Sporothrix and its warm-blooded hosts. We propose that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase has potential for the serological diagnosis of sporotrichosis and as target for the development of an effective multi-species vaccine against sporotrichosis in animals and humans.","publish_time":"2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodrigues, Anderson Messias; Fernandes, Geisa Ferreira; Araujo, Leticia Mendes; Della Terra, Paula Portella; dos Santos, Priscila Oliveira; Pereira, Sandro Antonio; Schubach, T\u00E2nia Maria Pacheco; Burger, Eva; Lopes-Bezerra, Leila Maria; de Camargo, Zoilo Pires","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d889f70c1e55668de7d33d59e76f3daf7cc8a28b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4549111.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26305691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. schenckii"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human sporotrichosis","animal sporotrichosis","Sporothrix schenckii","major antigens of feline sporotrichosis","serological diagnosis of sporotrichosis","Early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis","humans","coevolution of Sporothrix","healthy cats","sets of Sporothrix antigens","pathogenic fungus Sporothrix brasiliensis","feline outbreaks","brasiliensis proteome","kDa protein","convergent IgG-response","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-Sporothrix IgG","protein extracts","presence","agents of human","Two-dimensional immunoblotting","carboxymuconate cyclase","One-dimensional immunoblotting","IgG-reactive isoforms of gp60","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","associated species","humoral response","various hosts","warm-blooded hosts","Antigen profiling","immunodominant antigen","related agents","diversity of serum antibodies","effective multi-species vaccine","appropriate disease control measures","high sensitivity","specificity","sera","key role","development","closest known relatives","overwhelming occurrence","zoonotic transmission","target","animals","potential","mice","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","large sapronoses","surrogate marker of infection","understanding","important implications","massive transmissions","BACKGROUND","area","utility","antigenic epitopes","hypothesis","Epidemiological surveillance","curve","zoonoses","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","serodiagnosis","diseases","controls","METHODOLOGY"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of these coronaviruses, we conducted a longitudinal surveillance in fruit bats in Yunnan province, China during 2009\u20132016. A total of 59 (10.63%) bat samples were positive for the two betacorona-viruses, 46 (8.29%) for HKU9 and 13 (2.34%) for GCCDC1, or closely related viruses. We identified a novel HKU9 strain, tentatively designated as BatCoV HKU9-2202, by sequencing the full-length genome. The BatCoV HKU9-2202 shared 83% nucleotide identity with other BatCoV HKU9 stains based on whole genome sequences. The most divergent region is in the spike protein, which only shares 68% amino acid identity with BatCoV HKU9. Quantitative PCR revealed that the intestine was the primary infection organ of BatCoV HKU9 and GCCDC1, but some HKU9 was also detected in the heart, kidney, and lung tissues of bats. This study highlights the importance of virus surveillance in natural reservoirs and emphasizes the need for preparedness against the potential spill-over of these viruses to local residents living near bat caves.

As reviewed herein, the T-cell response to vaccination requires a fine balance between the generation of inflammatory effector T cells versus follicular helper T (TFH) cells that mediate high-affinity antibody production in tandem with the induction of long-lived memory cells for effective recall immunity. During aging, we find that this balance is tipped where T cells favor short-lived effector but not memory or TFH responses. Consistently, vaccine-induced antibodies commonly display a lower protective capacity. Mechanistically, multiple, potentially targetable, changes in T cells have been identified that contribute to these age-related defects, including posttranscription regulation, T-cell receptor signaling, and metabolic function. Although research into the induction of tissue-specific immunity by vaccines and with age is still limited, current mechanistic insights provide a framework for improved design of age-specific vaccination strategies that require further evaluation in a clinical setting.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gustafson, Claire E.; Kim, Chulwoo; Weyand, Cornelia M.; Goronzy, J\u00F6rg J.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17b41d2fb22f5f61e7e8cabf3285814d3e9cd252.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198995.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920304218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32386655/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920304218; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.03.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TFH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cell receptor","T-cell response","T-cell compartment","generation of inflammatory effector T cells","follicular helper T","induction of long-lived memory cells","specific immunity","TFH responses","improved design of age","specific vaccination strategies","Impaired vaccine responses","short-lived effector","induction of tissue","fine balance","effective recall immunity","vaccine-induced antibodies","tandem","framework","posttranscription regulation","high-affinity antibody production","older individuals","evaluation","quality","current mechanistic insights","alterations","vaccines","changes","lower protective capacity","age-related defects","metabolic function","quantity","clinical setting","research","aging"],"language":"en"},

While the hypothesis that dromedary camels are the likely major source of MERS-CoV infection in humans is gaining acceptance, conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host(s) and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus. Dromedary camels were imported to Australia, principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabiting extensive parts of the continent. Here we report that during a focussed surveillance study, no serological evidence was found for the presence of MERS-CoV in the camels in the Australian population. This finding presents various hypotheses about the timing of the emergence and spread of MERS-CoV throughout populations of camels in Africa and Asia, which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camels from the original source region, which we have inferred was mainly northwestern Pakistan. In addition, we identify bat species which overlap (or neighbour) the range of the Australian camel population with a higher likelihood of carrying CoVs of the same lineage as MERS-CoV.

The mosquito-borne Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the Togaviridae family and is an important biodefense pathogen and select agent. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for VEEV infections; therefore, it is imperative to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. We hypothesized that a functional UPS is required for efficient VEEV multiplication. We have shown that at non-toxic concentrations Bortezomib, a FDA-approved inhibitor of the proteasome, proved to be a potent inhibitor of VEEV multiplication in the human astrocytoma cell line U87MG. Bortezomib inhibited the virulent Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain and the attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV. Additional studies with virulent strains of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) demonstrated that Bortezomib is a broad spectrum inhibitor of the New World alphaviruses. Time-of-addition assays showed that Bortezomib was an effective inhibitor of viral multiplication even when the drug was introduced many hours post exposure to the virus. Mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the VEEV capsid protein is ubiquitinated in infected cells, which was validated by confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequent studies revealed that capsid is ubiquitinated on K48 during early stages of infection which was affected by Bortezomib treatment. This study will aid future investigations in identifying host proteins as potential broad spectrum therapeutic targets for treating alphavirus infections.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amaya, Moushimi; Keck, Forrest; Lindquist, Michael; Voss, Kelsey; Scavone, Lauren; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Roberts, Brian; Bailey, Charles; Schmaljohn, Connie; Narayanan, Aarthi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bf3f075175c307923fc400707b30616a676419c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4415917.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25927990/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0124792","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ubiquitin Proteasome System","UPS","VEEV","Eastern"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strain of VEEV","VEEV infections","potent inhibitor of VEEV multiplication","efficient VEEV multiplication","VEEV capsid protein","Bortezomib treatment","Western equine encephalitis virus","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","effective inhibitor of viral multiplication","broad spectrum inhibitor","virulent strains of Eastern equine encephalitis virus","FDA-approved inhibitor","non-toxic concentrations Bortezomib","potential broad spectrum therapeutic targets","novel targets","therapeutic development","alphavirus infections","approved vaccines","functional UPS","Additional studies","immunoprecipitation assays","addition assays","Subsequent studies","persistent infection","virulent Trinidad donkey","Ubiquitin Proteasome System","early stages of infection","EEEV","host proteins","TrD","human astrocytoma cell line U87MG","attenuated TC","important biodefense pathogen","WEEV","future investigations","New World alphaviruses","Togaviridae family","utilizing","K48","infected cells","drug","Mass spectrometry analyses","therapies","mosquito","confocal microscopy","agent","hours","exposure","study","Time"],"language":"en"},

Rapid, accurate, and nondestructive methods for detection of viruses are of great importance to protect public health. In this study, surface\u2010enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with gold SERS\u2010active substrates was used to detect and discriminate 7 food\u2010 and waterborne viruses, including norovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, and herpersvirus. Virus samples were purified and dialyzed in phosphate buffered saline (8 to 9 log PFU/mL) and then further diluted in deionized water for SERS measurement. After capturing the characteristic SERS spectral patterns, multivariate statistical analyses, including soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were employed to analyze SERS spectral data for characterization and identification of viruses. The results show that SIMCA was able to differentiate viruses with and without envelope with \u003E95% of classification accuracy, while PCA presented clear spectral data segregations between different virus strains. The virus detection limit by SERS using gold substrates reached a titer of 10(2).

METHODS: Surveillance physicians collected respiratory specimens from children aged \u003C5 years hospitalized with respiratory illness and residing in the primary hospital catchment areas. We tested respiratory specimens for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus and rhinoviruses using rRT-PCR. During 2013, we conducted a health utilization survey in the primary catchment areas of the hospitals to determine the proportion of all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among children aged \u003C5 years at the surveillance hospitals during the preceding 12 months. We estimated the respiratory virus-specific incidence of hospitalization by dividing the estimated number of hospitalized children with a laboratory confirmed infection with a respiratory virus by the population aged \u003C5 years of the catchment areas and adjusted for the proportion of children who were hospitalized at the surveillance hospitals. RESULTS: We estimated that the annual incidence per 1000 children (95% CI) of all cause associated respiratory hospitalization was 11.5 (10\u201312). The incidences per 1000 children (95% CI) per year for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and influenza infections were 3(2\u20133), 0.5(0.4\u20130.8), 0.4 (0.3\u20130.6), 0.4 (0.3\u20130.6), and 0.4 (0.3\u20130.6) respectively.

Many emerging viruses have RNA genomes and as such are capable of rapid mutation and selection of new variants in the face of environmental changes in host numbers and available target species. This review summarizes recent work on aspects of virus emergence and the current understanding of the molecular and immunological basis whereby viruses may cross between species and become established in new ecological niches. Emergence is hard to predict, although mathematical modeling and spatial epidemiology have done much to improve the prediction of where emergence may occur. However, much needs to be done to ensure adequate surveillance is maintained of animal species known to present the greatest risk thus increasing general alertness among physicians, veterinarians and those responsible for formulating public health policy.","publish_time":"2012-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Howard, Colin R; Fletcher, Nicola F","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b69d402abfb10509e1518f2f2b38e8d8840f34e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3630908.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2012.47; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal species","principal host species","animal host","emerging viruses","host numbers","available target species","aspects of virus emergence","new examples","face of environmental changes","selection of new variants","Emerging virus diseases","veterinary public health","new ecological niches","public health policy","major threat","major drivers","factors responsible","human behavior","increasing urbanization of mankind","current understanding","balance","local ecosystems","general alertness","physicians","capable of rapid mutation","veterinarians","greatest risk","recent work","immunological basis","pathogen","mathematical modeling","RNA genomes","year","adequate surveillance","spatial epidemiology","review","majority","needs","prediction"],"language":"en"},

Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification). Results obtained from cell lines which differed in permissiveness to MHV infection suggested that the ability to support MHV infection does not correlate with endocytosis. Rather, nonpermissive cells, such as rat astrocytoma (C-6) and Vero cells, showed higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV than did fully permissive L-2 cells. Cells which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHV-susceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion. Thus endocytic internalization of MHV, which clearly occurs in a variety of cells, does not guarantee productive infection.","publish_time":"1991-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kooi, Cora; Cervin, Marguerite; Anderson, Robert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dd55fd0a85ac293d72b4c64589532f28d2a6962.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682291900143; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682291900143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Endocytosis"],"organizations":["MHV","VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Endocytosis of MHV","MHV inoculum","MHV-susceptible","dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV","endocytic internalization of MHV","host cell restriction of MHV infection","productive infection","Vero cells","nonpermissive cells","minutes of infection","homogenates of cells","variety of cells","VSV","higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV","nonendosomal membrane fusion","Abstract Early events of infection","endocytic pathway","functional endocytosis","results","direct virion-mediated cell fusion","PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus","cell lines","endocytic vesicles","ammonium chloride","plasma membrane","functional endosomes","pH","PEG-mediated susceptibility","chloroquine","idea","non-acidified compartment","fibroblasts","inhibition","minor role","Studies","rat astrocytoma","protease","block","permissiveness","ability","small proportion","lesser degree","viruses","comparison","Treatment of mouse","recovery of infectious","acidification"],"language":"en"},

In addition to their direct targeting of viral components, interferons and ISGs exert profound effects on cellular metabolism.

Despite the intensive application of IBV vaccines, several outbreaks have been reported worldwide. Here, we report several IBV outbreaks in thirteen poultry farms in Eastern Saudi Arabia (ESA) from 2013 to 2014. The main goals of the current study were as follows: (1) isolation and molecular characterization of the currently circulating strains in ESA (Al-Hasa, Dammam, and Buqayq) and (2) evaluation of the immune status of these birds to IBV. To achieve our goals, tissue specimens (trachea, lungs, liver, kidney and cecal tonsils) and sera were collected. High morbidity up to 100% and mortality ranging from 18 to 90% were reported. Severe infection was observed in the trachea, bronchi, and kidneys of the infected birds. IBV strains were isolated using embryonated chicken eggs. The isolated viruses induced hemorrhage, dwarfing and death of the inoculated embryos 3\u20135 days post-infection. The circulating IBV strains were identified by sequencing the partial IBV-N and IBV-S1 genes. These viruses showed 95% sequence identity to Indian, Italian, Egyptian and Chinese strains and were quite distinct from the locally used vaccines on the genomic level. Interestingly, high antibody titers against IBV were reported in some of these farms, suggesting the presence of new virulent strains in ESA. The seroconversion of infected birds was reported among the affected flocks. In conclusion, very virulent IBV strains are currently circulating in ESA. Further studies are currently in progress to molecularly characterize these IBV strains.

We used immunocytochemistry with an organelle-specific antiserum to investigate the morphologic changes of the GA during infection of L2 murine fibroblasts with MHV-A59. Twenty-four hours after infection the GA was fragmented and translocated in the center of syncytia, while the microtubular network was also rearranged displaying radiating elements toward the center of syncytia. Two fusion-defective mutants, which contain an identical amino acid substitution in the cleavage signal sequence of the spike glycoprotein (S), induced fragmentation of the GA. However, the GA migrated only partially to the centers of syncytia during infection with these mutants. Revertant viruses, in which the above mutation was corrected, had fusion properties and GA staining similar to wtMHV-A59. Experiments with brefeldin A (BFA), which induces redistribution of the GA into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), revealed that an intact GA for a period of 4\u201316 hr postinfection, is required for coronavirus replication and syncytia formation. Thus, during MHV infection, syncytia formation is associated with fragmentation of the GA, followed by a previously undescribed phenomenon of migration of the organelle into the centers of syncytia. The fragmentation of the GA, however, may occur without the formation of syncytia. Therefore, two distinct mechanisms may be responsible for the fragmentation of the GA and its subsequent migration to the center of syncytia.","publish_time":"1996-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"LAVI, EHUD; WANG, QIAN; WEISS, SUSAN R.; GONATAS, NICHOLAS K.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a014febfeeb03575a31fdc1bdedcf236898dea50.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296903827; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296903827","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intact GA","center of syncytia","syncytia formation","formation of syncytia","centers of syncytia","GA staining similar","MHV infection","induced fragmentation","infection of L2 murine fibroblasts","fusion-defective mutants","spike glycoprotein","coronavirus replication","fusion properties","wtMHV-A59","subsequent migration","membrane glycoprotein","organelle-specific antiserum","undescribed phenomenon of migration","Abstract Coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","cleavage signal sequence","identical amino acid substitution","morphologic changes","radiating elements","rough endoplasmic reticulum","RER","period","microtubular network","hr postinfection","BFA","mutation","immunocytochemistry","redistribution","distinct mechanisms","Experiments","brefeldin","Golgi apparatus","hours","Revertant viruses"],"language":"en"},

Spatial diffusion theory distinguishes between two dimensions of a diffusion process. On the one hand, the routes may be determined by proximity \u2013 spreading to nearby places \u2013 or by hierarchical levels \u2013 spreading between places in a stepwise manner. On the other hand, the structure of diffusion appears as either expansion or relocation. The geographical context of health and disease can be conceived as epidemiological landscapes or landscapes of exposure. These are dynamic, i.e., their contents and extensions will change over time. The epidemiological transition might appear as a spatial diffusion of diseases, but is rather the outcome of changing ecological preconditions for disease and disease determinants. Increasing spatial connectivity has radically altered the routes and speed of diffusion. Global and local environmental changes alter the prospects for health.

Understanding the geographical diffusion of diseases is important for predicting and containing diseases.

Mortalities continued for approximately 7 weeks and affected mostly adult animals. More than 400 dead or dying animals were observed and population surveys conducted after the outbreak had ceased indicated that only a very small proportion of the population had survived, severely threatening the viability of the wild population. At necropsy, animals were in poor body condition, had bilateral swollen eyelids and some animals had tan foci on the skin of the ventral thighs. Histological examination revealed peri-orbital, splenic and nephric inflammation and necrosis. A virus was isolated in cell culture from a range of tissues. Nucleic acid sequencing of the virus isolate has identified the entire genome and indicates that this is a novel nidovirus that has a low level of nucleotide similarity to recognised nidoviruses. Its closest relatives are nidoviruses that have recently been described in pythons and lizards, usually in association with respiratory disease. In contrast, in the affected turtles, the most significant pathological changes were in the kidneys. Real time PCR assays developed to detect this virus demonstrated very high virus loads in affected tissues. In situ hybridisation studies confirmed the presence of viral nucleic acid in tissues in association with pathological changes. Collectively these data suggest that this virus is the likely cause of the mortalities that now threaten the survival of this species. Bellinger River Virus is the name proposed for this new virus.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jing; Finlaison, Deborah S.; Frost, Melinda J.; Gestier, Sarah; Gu, Xingnian; Hall, Jane; Jenkins, Cheryl; Parrish, Kate; Read, Andrew J.; Srivastava, Mukesh; Rose, Karrie; Kirkland, Peter D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05c54da3a4bd3e92c4d0e5286e331e333408c9a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6200216.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30356240/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New South Wales","Australia"],"keyphrases":["new virus","virus isolate","high virus","Bellinger River Virus","affected tissues","adult animals","population surveys","wild population","association","range of tissues","sole extant population","affected turtles","nidoviruses","Mortalities","Nucleic acid sequencing","significant pathological changes","presence of viral nucleic acid","coastal river","New South Wales","endangered species of freshwater snapping turtle","bilateral swollen eyelids","Myuchelys georgesi","poor body condition","peri-orbital","skin","tan foci","low level of nucleotide similarity","nephric inflammation","situ hybridisation studies","Australia","cell culture","Histological examination","Real time PCR assays","large number of deaths","novel nidovirus","necrosis","lizards","necropsy","kidneys","entire genome","weeks","likely cause","ventral thighs","respiratory disease","closest relatives","pythons","contrast","small proportion","viability","outbreak","survival","data"],"language":"en"},

Low infectious dose and high viability in the environment are major challenges in eradication of this virus. To further understand the viability of PEDv in the infected manure, we longitudinally monitored survivability and infectivity of PEDv in two open earthen manure storages (EMS; previously referred to as lagoon) from two different infected swine farms identified in the province of Manitoba, Canada. Our study revealed that PEDv could survive up to 9 months in the infected EMS after the initial outbreak in the farm. The viral load varied among different layers of the EMS with an average of 1.1 \u00D7 10(5) copies/ml of EMS, independent of EMS temperature and pH. In both studied EMS, the evidence of viral replication was observed through increased viral load in the later weeks of the samplings while there was no new influx of infected manure into the EMS, which was suggestive of presence of potential alternative hosts for PEDv within the EMS. Decreasing infectivity of virus over time irrespective of increased viral load suggested the possibility of PEDv evolution within the EMS and perhaps in the new host that negatively impacted virus infectivity. Viral load in the top layer of the EMS was low and mostly non-infective suggesting that environmental factors, such as UV and sunlight, could diminish the replicability and infectivity of the virus. Thus, frequent agitation of the EMS that could expose virus to UV and sunlight might be a potential strategy for reduction of PEDv load and infectivity in the infected EMS.","publish_time":"2016-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tun, Hein M.; Cai, Zhangbin; Khafipour, Ehsan","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c07d89610bf10dbbc4124f1a65ffaab6855954ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4783413.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27014197/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS"],"locations":["North America","Canada"],"keyphrases":["infected EMS","studied EMS","infectivity of PEDv","infectivity of virus","independent of EMS temperature","viability of PEDv","reduction of PEDv load","increased viral load","impacted virus infectivity","possibility of PEDv evolution","new influx of infected manure","different infected swine farms","evidence of viral replication","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","sunlight","UV","high viability","potential strategy","open earthen manure storages","major challenges","new host","different layers","major epidemics","potential alternative hosts","Low infectious dose","North America\u2019s swine industry","non-infective suggesting","environmental factors","suggestive of presence","burden","recent years","later weeks","time","samplings","province of Manitoba","eradication","initial outbreak","lagoon","survivability","pH","replicability","months","Canada","frequent agitation","copies","average","study"],"language":"en"},

To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1\u00B73 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted,1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and external expert teams to Hubei province. The emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia has parallels with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was caused by another coronavirus that killed 349 of 5327 patients with confirmed infection in China.3 Although the diseases have different clinical presentations, the infectious cause, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, and insufficient preparedness of health authorities to address the outbreaks are similar. So far, mental health care for the patients and health professionals directly affected by the 2019-nCoV epidemic has been under-addressed, although the National Health Commission of China released the notification of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions for the 2019-nCoV pneumonia on Jan 26, 2020. This notification contained a reference to mental health problems and interventions that occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak, and mentioned that mental health care should be provided for patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonitis, close contacts, suspected cases who are isolated at home, patients in fever clinics, families and friends of affected people, health professionals caring for infected patients, and the public who are in need. To date, epidemiological data on the mental health problems and psychiatric morbidity of those suspected or diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV and their treating health professionals have not been available; therefore how best to respond to challenges during the outbreak is unknown. The observations of mental health consequences and measures taken during the 2003 SARS outbreak could help inform health authorities and the public to provide mental health interventions to those who are in need.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Yu-Tao; Yang, Yuan; Li, Wen; Zhang, Ling; Zhang, Qinge; Cheung, Teris; Ng, Chee H","journal":"The Lancet Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd15a966677353011a4612a91649b11306e87691.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128153.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32032543/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2215036620300468; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(20)30046-8; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036620300468","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission of China"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["mental health interventions","mental health problems","mental health care","treating health professionals","observations of mental health consequences","National Health Commission of China","major public health emergencies","nCoV pneumonia","insufficient preparedness of health authorities","infected patients","nCoV pneumonitis","SARS outbreak","nCoV epidemic","isolation of suspected","suspected cases","public transport","similar measures","epidemiological data","Hubei province","Wuhan","range of measures","need","collection of clinical data","friends of affected people","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","epidemiological features","emergency psychological crisis interventions","disease transmission","novel coronavirus","expert treatment consensus","external expert teams","national diagnostic criteria","fast transmission pattern","establishment of isolation units","notification of basic principles","different clinical presentations","infectious cause","prompt provision of medical supplies","dissemination of regional","biological samples","hospitals","families","level responses","fever clinics","monitoring","tracing","authority","close contacts","home","psychiatric morbidity","reference","autonomous regions","municipalities","diseases","wet market","Chinese provinces","early identification","confirmed infection","date","outbreaks","intense attention nationwide","risk","challenges","emergence","cities"],"language":"en"},

It is a single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus with 10,700 bases. The genus Flavivirus includes other arthropod borne viruses such as yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. It infects ~50\u2013200 million people annually, putting over 3.6 billion people living in tropical regions at risk and causing ~20,000 deaths annually. The expansion of dengue is attributed to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change, globalization, travel, trade, socioeconomics, settlement, and also viral evolution. There are four antigenically different serotypes of DENV based on the differences in their viral structural and nonstructural proteins. DENV infection causes a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic to dengue fever to severe dengue shock syndrome. Infection with one serotype confers lifelong immunity against that serotype, but heterologus infection leads to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Diagnosis of dengue infections is based mainly on serological detection of either antigen in acute cases or antibodies in both acute and chronic infection. Viral detection and real-time PCR detection though helpful is not feasible in resource poor setup. Treatment of dengue depends on symptomatic management along with fluid resuscitation and may require platelet transfusion. Although vaccine development is in late stages of development, developing a single vaccine against four serotypes often causes serious challenges to researchers; hence, the main stay of prevention is vector control and management.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murugesan, Amudhan; Manoharan, Mythreyee","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a92f695c75e4349fd76931c1800bb722ac5eca0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149978.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128194003000168; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128194003000168","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue fever","Abstract Dengue virus","Treatment of dengue","expansion of dengue","Zika virus","DENV infection","yellow fever virus","severe dengue hemorrhagic fever","Viral detection","Diagnosis of dengue infections","severe dengue shock syndrome","West Nile virus","tick-borne encephalitis virus","heterologus infection","chronic infection","positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus","serological detection","vaccine development","single vaccine","different serotypes of DENV","viral evolution","genus Flavivirus","people","real-time PCR detection","acute cases","symptomatic management","late stages of development","globalization","travel","antibodies","viruses","modern dynamics of climate change","trade","main stay of prevention","fluid resuscitation","researchers","vector control","settlement","socioeconomics","antigen","arthropod","differences","spectrum of illness","lifelong immunity","antibody-dependent enhancement","risk","bases","factors","family Flaviviridae","resource poor setup","serious challenges","nonstructural proteins","platelet transfusion","tropical regions","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Australian Aboriginal children suffer high rates of OM from early infancy. The resultant hearing loss can affect education and quality of life. As numerous factors contribute to the burden of OM, interventions aimed at reducing the impact of single risk factors are likely to fail. To identify key risk factors and understand how they interact in complex causal pathways, we followed 100 Aboriginal and 180 non\u2010Aboriginal children from birth to age 2 years in a semi\u2010arid zone of Western Australia. We collected demographic, obstetric, socio\u2010economic and environmental data, breast milk once, and nasopharyngeal samples and saliva on seven occasions. Ear health was assessed by clinical examination, tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and audiometry. We considered the conduct of our study in relation to national ethical guidelines for research in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. After 1 year of community consultation, the study was endorsed by local committees and ethical approval granted. Fieldwork was tailored to minimise disruption to people\u0027s lives and we provided regular feedback to the community. We saw 81% of non\u2010Aboriginal and 65% of Aboriginal children at age 12 months. OM was diagnosed on 55% and 26% of routine clinical examinations in Aboriginal and non\u2010Aboriginal children respectively. Aboriginal mothers were younger and less educated, fewer were employed and they lived in more crowded conditions than non\u2010Aboriginal mothers. Sixty\u2010four per cent of Aboriginal and 40% of non\u2010Aboriginal babies were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. Early consultation, provision of a service while undertaking research, inclusion of Aboriginal people as active members of a research team and appropriate acknowledgement will assist in ensuring successful completion of the research.","publish_time":"2007-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehmann, Deborah; Arumugaswamy, Ashwini; Elsbury, Dimity; Finucane, Janine; Stokes, Annette; Monck, Ruth; Jeffries\u2010Stokes, Christine; McAullay, Daniel; Coates, Harvey; Stanley, Fiona J.","journal":"Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec40da3014c3302a854528a5b071dfe0b59f5d9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168013.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3016.2007.00891.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18173785/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non\u2010Aboriginal children","cent of Aboriginal","non\u2010Aboriginal mothers","non\u2010Aboriginal babies","Australian Aboriginal children","inclusion of Aboriginal people","research team","burden of OM","study","high rates of OM","Early consultation","key risk factors","numerous factors","age","impact of single risk factors","year of community consultation","environmental data","ethical approval","early infancy","Ear health","national ethical guidelines","routine clinical examinations","environmental tobacco smoke","Torres Strait Islander health","active members","transient evoked otoacoustic emissions","medical advice","breast milk","tympanometry","relation","education","nasopharyngeal samples","appropriate acknowledgement","years","service","semi\u2010arid zone of Western Australia","people\u0027s lives","common paediatric illnesses","audiometry","regular feedback","local committees","provision","crowded conditions","birth","resultant hearing loss","successful completion","disruption","quality of life","saliva","occasions","developed countries","demographic","interventions","months","complex causal pathways","fewer","conduct","Otitis media","Fieldwork"],"language":"en"},

Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. METHODS: GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. FINDINGS: The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90\u00B73 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17\u00B72% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186\u00B77 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26\u00B79% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83\u00B73% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60\u201380 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3\u00B77% to 7\u00B75% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region\u2019s health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the conflicts.

Specific antigens of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus were detected in the cytoplasm of enterocytes by the streptavidin-biotin (SAB) technique. Infected cells, which were most abundant in the villous epithelia of the jejunum and ileum, were present in small numbers in the large intestine, the crypt epithelia, the lamina propria and Peyer\u0027s patches.

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990-1000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232-478).

It is necessary for the development and repair of the brain and protection from oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which apoD interacts with lipoproteins in human plasma. By using detergent-free ELISA, we show that immobilized monoclonal antibodies against apoD very efficiently bind to low density lipoprotein (LDL) from plasma; this binding is as equally efficient as binding to an anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. Adding detergent to the plasma inhibited the binding, suggesting that the binding is dependent on the presence of intact lipoprotein particles. Reversing the system by using immobilized anti-apoB revealed that the affinity of apoD for LDL is rather low, suggesting that multiple bindings are needed for a durable connection. Biosensor experiments using purified lipoproteins also showed that purified apoD and high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3), a lipoprotein fraction rich in apoD, were both able to bind LDL very efficiently, indicating that the HDL3-LDL interaction may be a physiological consequence of the affinity of apoD for LDL. Furthermore, we found that apoD increases the binding of HDL to actively growing T24 bladder carcinoma cells but not to quiescent, contact-inhibited, confluent T24 cells. This result is especially intriguing given that the T24 supernatant only contained detectable levels of apoD after growth inhibition, raising the possibility that alternating the expression of apoD and a putative apoD-receptor could give direction to the flow of lipids. In the current paper, we conclude that apoD mediates binding of HDL to LDL and to growing T24 carcinomas, thereby highlighting the importance of apoD in lipid metabolism.","publish_time":"2014-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braesch-Andersen, Sten; Beckman, Lena; Paulie, Staffan; Kumagai-Braesch, Makiko","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9367d8e090900c57b11a99848144bd83dcb80bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4267786.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25513803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified apoD","affinity of apoD","importance of apoD","expression of apoD","detectable levels of apoD","putative apoD-receptor","binding of HDL","HDL3-LDL interaction","low density lipoprotein","T24 supernatant","T24 carcinomas","confluent T24 cells","high density lipoprotein","purified lipoproteins","immobilized anti-apoB","growing T24 bladder carcinoma cells","lipoprotein fraction rich","human plasma","anti-apoB monoclonal antibody","presence of intact lipoprotein particles","immobilized monoclonal antibodies","detergent-free ELISA","brain","direction","growth inhibition","contact","physiological consequence","repair","important protein","protection","possibility","multiple bindings","parts","development","oxidative stress","Biosensor experiments","lipid metabolism","system","extent","durable connection","flow of lipids","study","Apolipoprotein","result","current paper","purpose"],"language":"en"},

However, its role is unclear in children with severe respiratory failure. Objectives We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of severe respiratory failure associated with WUPyV infection in children. Study design We retrospectively reviewed cases of respiratory tract infection at a tertiary children\u0027s hospital in Japan and performed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for WUPyV using residual extracted nucleic acid samples taken from respiratory tract samples of pediatric patients primarily with respiratory failure. We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients positive for WUPyV and assessed samples positive for WUPyV for other respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. Results WUPyV was detected in 14 of 318 specimens of respiratory tract infections. The median age was 34 months and males were predominant (n = 11, 64%). An underlying disease was found in 11 (79%) patients including five preterm and three immunocompromised patients. The most common clinical diagnosis was pneumonia (n = 13, 93%). The majority of the samples were endotracheal tube aspirates (n = 11, 79%). Other viruses were co-detected in nine (64%) patients, while WUPyV was the only pathogen detected in five patients with a history of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. These five patients presented with fever and cough, and perihilar infiltrates were detected on chest radiograph in several days. Conclusions WUPyV was detected in children with severe respiratory failure independently or concurrently with other pathogens. WUPyV can be a pathogen for children with a history of preterm birth or an underlying disease.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uda, Kazuhiro; Koyama-Wakai, Chitose; Shoji, Kensuke; Iwase, Noriyasu; Motooka, Daisuke; Nakamura, Shota; Miyairi, Isao","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2491ac290f5c7127a3ea382b24e4352a0ea188b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106500.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218301975; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218301975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30114678/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.08.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["WU"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["WUPyV infection","respiratory infections","respiratory pathogens","Conclusions WUPyV","Results WUPyV","respiratory tract samples of pediatric patients","characteristics of severe respiratory failure","immunocompromised patients","specimens of respiratory tract infections","reviewed cases of respiratory tract infection","clinical characteristics of patients positive","samples positive","underlying disease","history of preterm birth","residual extracted nucleic acid samples","history of admission","multiplex PCR","common clinical diagnosis","Japan","tertiary children\u0027s hospital","real-time polymerase chain reaction","perihilar infiltrates","months","males","endotracheal tube aspirates","neonatal intensive care unit","chest radiograph","fever","cough","pneumonia","Abstract Background WU polyomavirus","new virus","Study design","median age","majority","days","role","viruses","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Newborn piglets were orally inoculated with PEAV P15, P67 and P100. Compared with P15 and P67, P100 resulted in only mild clinical signs and intestinal lesions in piglets.

Identification of additional components of the RAS and associated vasoactive pathways, as well as new structural and functional insights into established targets, have led to novel therapeutic approaches with the potential to provide improved cardiovascular protection and better blood pressure control and/or reduced adverse side effects. The simultaneous modulation of several neurohumoral mediators in key interconnected blood pressure\u2013regulating pathways has been an attractive approach to improve treatment efficacy, and several novel approaches involve combination therapy or dual-acting agents. In addition, increased understanding of the complexity of the RAS has led to novel approaches aimed at upregulating the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas axis to counter-regulate the harmful effects of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin III/AT(1)R axis. These advances have opened new avenues for the development of novel drugs targeting the RAS to better treat hypertension and heart failure.

The RSVs were detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and single-tube RT-PCR, their nucleotides were sequenced, and they were tested for positive selection. Of the 165 positive samples, 131 (79.4%) carried RSV-A and 34 (20.6%) RSV-B; both groups co-circulated in all of the study periods, with RSV-A predominating in all the seasons except for winter 2010\u20132011, which had a predominance of RSV-B. Phylogenetic analysis of the RSV-A sequences identified genotypes NA1 and ON1, the second replacing the first during the last two years of the study period. The RSV-B belonged to genotypes BA9 and BA10. BA9 was detected in all the years of the study whereas BA only desultorily. Comparison of the subjects infected by RSV-A and RSV-B types did not reveal any significant differences, but the children infected by genotype A/NA1 more frequently had lower respiratory tract infections (p\u003C0.0001) and required hospitalisation (p = 0.007) more often than those infected by genotype A/ON1. These findings show that RSV has complex patterns of circulation characterised by the periodical replacement of the predominant genotypes, and indicate that the circulation and pathogenic role of the different RSV strains should be investigated as each may have a different impact on the host. A knowledge of the correlations between types, genotypes and disease severity may also be important in order to be able to include the more virulent strains in future vaccines.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Piralla, Antonio; Zampiero, Alberto; Bianchini, Sonia; Di Pietro, Giada; Scala, Alessia; Pinzani, Raffaella; Fossali, Emilio; Baldanti, Fausto; Principi, Nicola","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce9c59c264fdc49364c0c7450fd49191f4effb00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4457818.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26047100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["predominance of RSV","RSV-B types","different RSV strains","severity of RSV infection","RSV-positive nasopharyngeal samples","genotypes NA1","genotypes BA9","predominant genotypes","positive samples","co-circulating genotypes of respiratory syncytial virus","children","study periods","order","years","ON1","positive selection","complex patterns of circulation","respiratory virus panel fast assay","lower respiratory tract infections","disease severity","virulent strains","different impact","groups co-circulated","single-tube RT-PCR","pathogenic role","sequences","possible relationships","genetic diversity","periodical replacement","Phylogenetic analysis","predominating","correlations","significant differences","nucleotides","future vaccines","findings","BA10","consecutive winters","seasons","host","knowledge","hospitalisation","RSVs","Comparison","subjects"],"language":"en"},

This study is intended to assess the performance of the airport screening procedures for dengue infection. METHODS: We analyzed data from the national surveillance system of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. We included the imported dengue cases reported by sentinel airports and clinics as well as the domestic cases from 2007\u20132010. RESULTS: Approximately 44.9% (95%CI: 35.73-54.13%) of the confirmed imported dengue cases with an apparent symptom (febrile) in the viremic stage were detected via the airport fever screening program, with an estimated positive predictive value of 2.36% (95% CI: 0.96- 3.75%) and a negative predictive value \u003E 99.99%. Fluctuations in the number of the symptomatic imported dengue cases identified in the airports (X) were associated with the total number of imported dengue cases (Y) based on a regression analysis of a biweekly surveillance (i.e., n = 104, R(2)(X:Y) = 0.61, P \u003C 0.005). Additionally, the fluctuating patterns in the cumulative numbers of the imported dengue cases (X) with a 1\u20132 month lead time (t) was in parallel with that of the domestic dengue cases (Y) based on a consecutive 4-year surveillance (i.e., n = 48, R(2)(X(t-1):Y) = 0.22, R(2)(X(t-2):Y) = 0.31, P \u003C 0.001) from 2007\u20132010. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate sensitivity of detecting dengue at the airports examined in this study indicated some limitations of the fever screening program for the prevention of importation. The screening program could assist in the rapid triage for self-quarantine of some symptomatic dengue cases that were in the viremic stage at the borders and contribute to active sentinel surveillance; however, the blocking of viral transmission to susceptible populations (neighbors or family) from all of the viremic travelers, including those with or without symptoms, is critical to prevent dengue epidemics. Therefore, the reinforcement of mosquito bite prevention and household vector control in dengue-endemic or dengue-competent hotspots during an epidemic season is essential and highly recommended.","publish_time":"2012-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuan, Mei-Mei; Chang, Feng-Yee","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/faada181a26e163dce05aa155b1516a66bb6154b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3462143.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22867003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptomatic dengue cases","dengue-endemic","domestic dengue cases","dengue infection","dengue epidemics","symptomatic imported dengue cases","confirmed imported dengue cases","total number of imported dengue cases","dengue-competent hotspots","domestic cases","airport fever screening program","sentinel airports","airport screening procedures","biweekly surveillance","year surveillance","viremic stage","active sentinel surveillance","national surveillance system","viremic travelers","study","CI","negative predictive value","Disease Control","Taiwan Centers","prevention of importation","endemic status","estimated positive predictive value","household vector control","early detection of febrile passengers","reinforcement of mosquito bite prevention","susceptible populations","self-quarantine","cumulative numbers","apparent symptom","epidemic season","blocking of viral transmission","neighbors","rapid triage","borders","clinics","family","data","regression analysis","performance","limitations","moderate sensitivity","month lead time","fluctuating patterns","CONCLUSIONS","Fluctuations","symptoms","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 1208 Chinese Hong Kong citizens (mean age=46.89 years; 63% female) in the first two weeks of February 2015. Respondents gave their informed consent and reported personal, social, and economic resource loss since the Umbrella Movement (Conservation of Resources-Evaluation), current anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and self-rated health (1=very good, 4=very bad). RESULTS: A total of 47.35% (95% CI=44.55, 50.17) respondents reported moderate/severe anxiety symptoms and 14.4% (95% CI=12.54, 16.50) reported moderate/severe depressive symptoms; 9.11% (95% CI=7.61, 10.86) reported \u201Cpoor\u201D or \u201Cvery poor\u201D health.

LIMITATIONS: This study was cross-sectional in nature and thus could not determine causality from the associations between resource loss and outcome variables. Second, the telephone survey relied on self-reports; response bias and social desirability could influence respondents\u0027 answers and discount data validity. Third, potential confounders such as preexisting mental and physical health issues and concurrent predictors like exposure to the Umbrella Movement were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies following any recent political movement (e.g., The Arab Spring) to quantify distress and the associated correlates of distress among affected citizens.

These vaccines should not burden the immune system by initiating responses against non-essential antigens. However, the efficacy of these vaccines is only as good as the delivery technology or route used to present them to the immune system. Some vaccines, traditionally given by the parenteral route, are now given by the natural route; either orally or intranasally. Two major advantages, often interrelated, are the rapid onset of immunity and stimulation of the local, mucosal immunity. These new technologies are now making an impact on current vaccine development. The balance has to be found between what is technologically feasible and what will provide at least as good a protective immunity as current, conventional vaccines. As new and emerging diseases appear globally, new opportunities arise for molecular and conventional technologies to be applied to both the development and delivery of novel vaccines, as well as the improvement of vaccines in current use.","publish_time":"2006-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chalmers, W.S.K.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/766fa939d995f6dfff5361142c3abac07e2bd846.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131788.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506001404; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506001404","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new vaccines","conventional vaccines","improvement of vaccines","immune system","delivery of novel vaccines","new technologies","protective immunity","protective immune mediated responses","new opportunities","mucosal immunity","current use","current vaccine development","delivery technology","conventional technologies","parenteral route","natural route","rapid onset of immunity","Abstract Molecular technology","reactive antigens","initiating responses","non-essential antigens","stimulation","mode of action","impact","aetiology of disease","greater insight","functioning","emerging diseases","veterinary pathogens","cell","major advantages","host","efficacy","knowledge","balance"],"language":"en"},

Here we present the structure of a murine coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 \u00C5 resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins(2,3), implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses.

A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing).

Also, the role of CCR5 in CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T cell (Treg) homing has recently begun to grab attention. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is defined as severe neuroinflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) following infection with mosquito-borne flavivirus JE virus. However, the potential contribution of CCR5 to JE progression via mediating CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) Treg homing has not been investigated. METHODS: Infected wild-type (Ccr5(\u002B/\u002B)) and CCR5-deficient (Ccr5(\u2212/\u2212)) mice were examined daily for mortality and clinical signs, and neuroinflammation in the CNS was evaluated by infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and cytokine expression. In addition, viral burden, NK- and JEV-specific T cell responses were analyzed. Adoptive transfer of CCR5(\u002B)CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) Tregs was used to evaluate the role of Tregs in JE progression. RESULTS: CCR5 ablation exacerbated JE without altering viral burden in the extraneural and CNS tissues, as manifested by increased CNS infiltration of Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and Ly-6G(hi) granulocytes. Compared to Ccr5(\u002B/\u002B) mice, Ccr5(\u2212/\u2212) mice unexpectedly showed increased responses of IFN-\u03B3(\u002B)NK and CD8(\u002B) T cells in the spleen, but not CD4(\u002B) T cells. More interestingly, CCR5-ablation resulted in a skewed response to IL-17(\u002B)CD4(\u002B) Th17 cells and correspondingly reduced CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) Tregs in the spleen and brain, which was closely associated with exacerbated JE. Our results also revealed that adoptive transfer of sorted CCR5(\u002B)CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) Tregs into Ccr5(\u2212/\u2212) mice could ameliorate JE progression without apparently altering the viral burden and CNS infiltration of IL-17(\u002B)CD4(\u002B) Th17 cells, myeloid-derived Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and Ly-6G(hi) granulocytes. Instead, adoptive transfer of CCR5(\u002B)CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) Tregs into Ccr5(\u2212/\u2212) mice resulted in increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-\u03B2) in the spleen and brain, and transferred CCR5(\u002B) Tregs were found to produce IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: CCR5 regulates JE progression via governing timely and appropriate CNS infiltration of CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) Tregs, thereby facilitating host survival. Therefore, this critical and extended role of CCR5 in JE raises possible safety concerns regarding the use of CCR5 antagonists in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who inhabit regions in which both HIV and flaviviruses, such as JEV and West Nile virus, are endemic.","publish_time":"2016-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jin Hyoung; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Choi, Jin Young; Kim, Seong Bum; Uyangaa, Erdenebelig; Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John Hwa; Eo, Seong Kug","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/953d78fb78ffe2bd8db79fac2390d45bd28a4952.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5050958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439902/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-016-0656-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCR5 ablation","CCR5-ablation","transferred CCR5","CCR5-deficient","Adoptive transfer of CCR5","extended role of CCR5","use of CCR5 antagonists","potential contribution of CCR5","Foxp3","JE progression","adoptive transfer of sorted CCR5","exacerbated JE","mediating CD4","reduced CD4","appropriate CNS infiltration of CD4","T cells","role of Tregs","mice","CNS infiltration of IL","flavivirus JE virus","increased CNS infiltration of Ly","CNS tissues","Th17 cells","NK","viral burden","spleen","regulatory T cell","JEV-specific T cell responses","infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes","increased responses of IFN","HIV","myeloid-derived Ly","Treg homing","monocytes","brain","RESULTS","granulocytes","increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines","human immunodeficiency virus","West Nile virus","severe neuroinflammation","infected individuals","cytokine expression","inflamed tissues","migration of effector leukocytes","Infected wild-type","possible safety concerns","infection","macrophages","central nervous system","CC chemokine receptor","extraneural","mosquito","regions","flaviviruses","mortality","TGF-\u03B2","CD8","clinical signs","skewed response","METHODS","BACKGROUND","addition","CONCLUSIONS","host survival","Japanese encephalitis","attention"],"language":"en"},

Manufacturers recommend a user seal check to identify on-site gross leakage. However, no empirical evidence is provided. Therefore, this study aims to examine validity of a user seal check on gross leakage detection in commonly used types of N95 respirators. Methods A convenience sample of 638 nursing students was recruited. On the wearing of 3 different designs of N95 respirators, namely 3M-1860s, 3M-1862, and Kimberly-Clark 46827, the standardized user seal check procedure was carried out to identify gross leakage. Repeated testing of leakage was followed by the use of a quantitative fit testing (QNFT) device in performing normal breathing and deep breathing exercises. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated accordingly. Results As indicated by QNFT, prevalence of actual gross leakage was 31.0%-39.2% with the 3M respirators and 65.4%-65.8% with the Kimberly-Clark respirator. Sensitivity and specificity of the user seal check for identifying actual gross leakage were approximately 27.7% and 75.5% for 3M-1860s, 22.1% and 80.5% for 3M-1862, and 26.9% and 80.2% for Kimberly-Clark 46827, respectively. Likelihood ratios were close to 1 (range, 0.89-1.51) for all types of respirators.

These were recovered from HIV-1 infected subjects, and several (e.g., PG9, PG16, CH01, CH03) target glycans in the first and second variable (V1/V2) domain of gp120. The V1/V2 domain is thought to play an important role in conformational masking, and antibodies to the V1/V2 domain were recently identified as the only immune response that correlated with protection in the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial. While the importance of antibodies to polymeric glycans is well established for vaccines targeting bacterial diseases, the importance of antibodies to glycans in vaccines targeting HIV has only recently been recognized. Antibodies to GDEs may be particularly significant in HIV vaccines based on gp120, where 50% of the molecular mass of the envelope protein is contributed by N-linked carbohydrate. However, few studies have reported antibodies to GDEs in humans or animals immunized with candidate HIV-1 vaccines. In this report, we describe the isolation of a mouse mAb, 4B6, after immunization with the extracellular domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp140. Epitope mapping using glycopeptide fragments and in vitro mutagenesis showed that binding of this antibody depends on N-linked glycosylation at asparagine N130 (HXB2 numbering) in the gp120 V1/V2 domain. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to natural HIV-1 infection, immunization with recombinant proteins can elicit antibodies to the GDEs in the V1/V2 domain of gp120. Although little is known regarding conditions that favor antibody responses to GDEs, our studies demonstrate that these antibodies can arise from a short-term immunization regimen. Our results suggest that antibodies to GDEs are more common than previously suspected, and that further analysis of antibody responses to the HIV-1 envelope protein will lead to the discovery of additional antibodies to GDEs.","publish_time":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doran, Rachel C.; Morales, Javier F.; To, Briana; Morin, Trevor J.; Theolis, Richard; O\u2019Rourke, Sara M.; Yu, Bin; Mesa, Kathryn A.; Berman, Phillip W.","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01bb742453c2437b1e8a7fac34fe475ac6cc0f24.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8a5bf2b16d131fbee41247f16dc53c0fd3511c3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4157072.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589014001564; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4157072?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2014.06.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016576/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589014001564","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GDEs","HIV vaccines","importance of antibodies","monoclonal antibodies","V2 domain of gp120","RV144 HIV","natural HIV","candidate HIV","gp120 V1","discovery of additional antibodies","envelope protein","extracellular domain","target glycans","analysis of antibody responses","polymeric glycans","Recent studies","results","N-linked glycosylation","N-linked carbohydrate","short-term immunization regimen","HXB2 numbering","asparagine N130","infection","CH01","CH03","mutagenesis","4B6","humans","animals","glycopeptide fragments","bN-mAbs","conformational masking","recombinant proteins","glycan-dependent epitopes","isolation","PG16","mouse mAb","binding","important role","protection","bacterial diseases","variable","Epitope mapping","PG9","vaccine trial","molecular mass","conditions","gp140","immune response","infected subjects","report"],"language":"en"},

Present study aimed to investigate the level of culturable microbes associated with PM and their toxicological characterization in urban and rural houses of Pune city. Highest concentration of bacterial aerosols observed to be associated with PM10 size fraction in urban site (2136 \u00B1 285 CFU/m3) whereas maximum fungal concentration has been measured in rural houses (1521 \u00B1 302 CFU/m3). Predominantly found bacterial species were Bacillus sp., S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungal species were Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., and Penicillium sp. in both urban and rural residential premises. Concentration of endotoxin measured using the kinetic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay exhibited that the level of endotoxin in both urban and rural sites are associated with household characteristics and the activities performed in indoor as well as outdoor. Cell free DTT assay confirmed the ability of these airborne microbes to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) varying along with the types of microorganisms. On exposure of A549 cells to airborne microbes, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed in terms of both necrosis and apoptosis pathway. Elevated production of nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells and macrophages clearly suggest the inflammatory nature of these airborne microbes. Results derived from the present study demonstrated that the indoor air of urban and rural houses of Pune is contaminated in terms of microbial load. Therefore, attention should be paid to control the factors favoring the microbial growth in order to safeguard the health of exposed inhabitants.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Ritwika; Jan, Rohi; Joshi, Uttara; Bhor, Renuka; Pai, Kalpana; Satsangi, P.

During erythrocyte development, TER-119(\u002B) Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase, while TER-119(\u002B) Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins.

Common respiratory viruses, such as measles and influenza, have been considered possible causative agents; however, neither of these viruses had been detected. During the fatal respiratory illnesses in 2003, 2005 and 2006, regular observations on affected individuals were recorded. Cause\u2010specific morbidity rates were 98.3, 52.4 and 33.8%, respectively. Mortality rates were 6.9, 3.2 and 4.6%; all deaths were observed in infants 2 months\u20132 years 9 months of age. Nine other chimpanzees have not been seen since the 2006 outbreak and are presumed dead; hence, morbidity and mortality rates for 2006 may be as high as 47.7 and 18.5%, respectively. During the 2005 and 2006 outbreaks, 12 fecal samples were collected from affected and nonaffected chimpanzees and analyzed for causative agents. Analysis of fecal samples from 2005 suggests the presence of paramyxovirus, and in 2006 a human\u2010related metapneumovirus was detected and identified in an affected chimpanzee whose infant died during the outbreak. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the causative agent associated with these illnesses is viral and contagious, possibly of human origin; and that, possibly more than one agent may be circulating in the population. We recommend that baseline health data be acquired and food wadge and fecal samples be obtained and bio\u2010banked as early as possible when attempting to habituate new groups of chimpanzees or other great apes. For already habituated populations, disease prevention strategies, ongoing health monitoring programs and reports of diagnostic findings should be an integral part of managing these populations.

In contrast, poxviruses have been widely perceived in the vaccine field as a poor choice of vector for the induction of humoral immunity. However, a growing body of data, from both animal models and recent clinical trials, now suggests that these vectors can be successfully utilized to prime and boost B cells and effective antibody responses. Significant progress has been made in the context of heterologous prime\u2013boost immunization regimes, whereby poxviruses are able to boost responses primed by other vectors, leading to the induction of high-titre antigen-specific antibody responses. In other cases, poxviral vectors have been shown to stimulate humoral immunity against both themselves and encoded transgenes, in particular viral surface proteins such as influenza haemagglutinin. In the veterinary field, recombinant poxviral vectors have made a significant impact with numerous vectors licensed for use against a variety of animal viruses. On-going studies continue to explore the potential of poxviral vectors to modulate qualitative aspects of the humoral response, as well as their amenability to adjuvantation seeking to improve quantitative antibody immunogenicity. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of B cell induction by recombinant poxviruses remain poorly defined, and further work is necessary to help guide the rational optimization of future poxviral vaccine candidates aiming to induce antibodies.","publish_time":"2013-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Draper, Simon J.; Cottingham, Matthew G.; Gilbert, Sarah C.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c011219f5dd677b4dfa1842539501bb1d1e01f0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131268.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.05.091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23746455/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X13007081; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13007081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant poxviral vectors","potential of poxviral vectors","numerous vectors","induction of humoral immunity","widespread clinical testing of candidate vectors","induction of high","recombinant poxviruses","effective antibody responses","induction of T cell-mediated immunity","underlying mechanisms of B cell induction","boost B cells","vaccine field","humoral response","rational optimization of future poxviral vaccine candidates","titre antigen-specific antibody responses","boost immunization regimes","quantitative antibody immunogenicity","human use","animal models","significant impact","veterinary field","Significant progress","recent clinical trials","variety of animal viruses","context of heterologous prime","particular viral surface proteins","encoded transgenes","vaccination","infectious intracellular pathogens","qualitative aspects","mainstay approach","poor choice of vector","influenza haemagglutinin","adjuvantation","cancer","suitability","amenability","growing body of data","antibodies","decade","On-going studies","work","Abstract","cases","contrast"],"language":"en"},

However, a complete genomic sequence analysis showed that ck/CH/LGX/130530 was more closely related to a Massachusetts type strain (95% similarity to strain H120) than to the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (86%), suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, and it showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 emerged from a recombination event between parental IBV H120 strain and pathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus. The results obtained from the pairwise comparison and nucleotide similarity showed that the recombination breakpoint was located in the nsp14 gene at nucleotides 17055\u201317083. In line with the high S1 gene sequence similarity, the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate was serotypically close to that of the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (73% antigenic relatedness). Furthermore, vaccination with the LDT3-A vaccine, which was derived from the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain by serial passaging in chicken eggs, provided good protection against challenge with the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, in contrast to the poor protection offered with the H120 vaccine. Interestingly, isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 exhibited low pathogenicity toward specific-pathogen-free chickens compared with the nephropathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, which was likely due to natural recombination in the 5\u2032 17-kb region of the genome.

Certainly, providers and health care systems will continue to examine and provide as safe and effective care as possible for patients in the current environment.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mishra, K.K.; Afshar, A.; Thariat, J.; Shih, H.A.; Scholey, J.E.; Daftari, I.K.; Kacperek, A.; Pica, A.; Hrbacek, J.; Dendale, R.; Mazal, A.; Heufelder, J.; Char, D.H.; Sauerwein, W.; Weber, D.C.; Damato, B.E.","journal":"Adv Radiat Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a743680c7d1a31ddbbcd23024ce24a8d14a71ced.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179507.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420300853; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337386/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420300853?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UM patients","proton therapy providers","proton ocular treatment","proton eye therapy facilities","PTCOG Ocular subcommittee","long-standing high-volume proton ocular programs","risk of viral transmission","COVID","pandemic","practice strategies","Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group","result of healthcare providers","appropriate treatment protocols","largest international community of particle","multidisciplinary recommendations","indications of potential ophthalmologic transmission","effective care","unique needs","unique circumstances","Practice considerations","intrinsic infectious risk","health care systems","tears","eyelashes","close proximity","factors","hospitals","local hospital procedures","conjunction","hair","national guidelines","provider teams","member institutions","life-threatening cancer","current environment","supplies","Uveal melanoma","document","light","Participating experts","practices"],"language":"en"},

All biopharmaceutical processes are required to have at least two distinct viral clearance steps to remove viruses. Most of these steps work well for enveloped viruses and large viruses, whether enveloped or not. That leaves a class of small non\u2010enveloped viruses, like parvoviruses and hepatitis A, which are not easily removed by these typical steps. In this study, we report the identification of trimeric peptides that bind specifically to porcine parvovirus (PPV) and their potential use to remove this virus from process solutions. All of the trimeric peptides isolated completely removed all detectable PPV from buffer in the first nine column volumes, corresponding to a clearance of 4.5\u20135.5 log of infectious virus. When the virus was spiked into a more complex matrix consisting of 7.5% human blood plasma, one of the trimers, WRW, was able to remove all detectable PPV in the first three column volumes, after which human blood plasma began to interfere with the binding of the virus to the peptide resin. These trimer resins removed considerably more virus than weak ion exchange resins. The results of this work indicate that small peptide ligand resins have the potential to be used in virus removal processes where removal of contaminating virus is necessary to ensure product safety.","publish_time":"2008-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heldt, Caryn L.; Gurgel, Patrick V.; Jaykus, Lee\u2010Ann; Carbonell, Ruben G.","journal":"Biotechnol Prog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d22f15920be34142d519cdacf63092f84661d76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161850.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18470993/; https://doi.org/10.1021/bp070412c","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus contamination","virus removal processes","removal of contaminating virus","log of infectious virus","human blood plasma","human sources","human therapeutics","large viruses","detectable PPV","class of small non\u2010enveloped viruses","small peptide ligand resins","column volumes","trimer resins","work","typical steps","distinct viral clearance steps","identification of trimeric peptides","potential use","weak ion exchange resins","peptide resin","biopharmaceutical processes","therapeutic products","growing concern","animal","parvoviruses","trimers","porcine parvovirus","buffer","product safety","hepatitis","complex matrix","binding","process solutions","WRW","market","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, interest is rapidly growing for extension of its application to in vivo systems, such as animal disease models and human therapeutics. Studies on RNAi have resulted in two basic methods for its use for gene selective inhibition: 1) cytoplasmic delivery of short dsRNA oligonucleotides (siRNA), which mimics an active intermediate of an endogenous RNAi mechanism and 2) nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes that express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which mimics the micro interfering RNA (miRNA) active intermediate of a different endogenous RNAi mechanism. Non\u2010viral gene delivery systems are a diverse collection of technologies that are applicable to both of these forms of RNAi. Importantly, unlike antisense and ribozyme systems, a remarkable trait of siRNA is a lack of dependence on chemical modifications blocking enzymatic degradation, although chemical protection methods developed for the earlier systems are being incorporated into siRNA and are generally compatible with non\u2010viral delivery systems. The use of siRNA is emerging more rapidly than for shRNA, in part due to the increased effort required to construct shRNA expression systems before selection of active sequences and verification of biological activity are obtained. In contrast, screens of many siRNA sequences can be accomplished rapidly using synthetic oligos. It is not surprising that the use of siRNA in vivo is also emerging first. Initial in vivo studies have been reported for both viral and non\u2010viral delivery but viral delivery is limited to shRNA. This review describes the emerging in vivo application of non\u2010viral delivery systems for RNAi for functional genomics, which will provide a foundation for further development of RNAi therapeutics. Of interest is the rapid adaptation of ligand\u2010targeted plasmid\u2010based nanoparticles for RNAi agents. These systems are growing in capabilities and beginning to pose a serious rival to viral vector based gene delivery. The activity of siRNA in the cytoplasm may lower the hurdle and thereby accelerate the successful development of therapeutics based on targeted non\u2010viral delivery systems.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Patrick Y.; Xie, Frank; Woodle, Martin C.","journal":"Advances in Genetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b064d587eef44386f353780ea1591d11f985a02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112075.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065266005540069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065266005540069","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Non\u2010viral gene delivery systems","targeted non\u2010viral delivery systems","application of non\u2010viral delivery systems","earlier systems","ribozyme systems","shRNA expression systems","use of siRNA","viral vector","RNAi agents","forms of RNAi","Abstract RNAi","siRNA sequences","activity of siRNA","development of RNAi therapeutics","nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes","different endogenous RNAi mechanism","remarkable trait of siRNA","cytoplasmic delivery of short dsRNA oligonucleotides","active intermediate","selection of active sequences","gene selective inhibition","human therapeutics","successful development of therapeutics","based nanoparticles","Studies","chemical protection methods","short hairpin RNA","targeted plasmid","chemical modifications","basic methods","micro interfering RNA","verification of biological activity","enzymatic degradation","drug target discovery","validation","powerful tool","lack of dependence","miRNA","diverse collection of technologies","cell culture","animal disease models","serious rival","rapid adaptation of ligand","functional genomics","foundation","displaced efforts","increased effort","ribozymes","hurdle","contrast","screens","review","capabilities","extension","synthetic oligos"],"language":"en"},

Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading around the globe1,2. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and show that inhibition of these pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication. We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our findings provide insight for the development of therapy options for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bojkova, Denisa; Klann, Kevin; Koch, Benjamin; Widera, Marek; Krause, David; Ciesek, Sandra; Cinatl, Jindrich; M\u00FCnch, Christian","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2332-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["termed SARS-CoV","cellular infection profile of SARS","Human infection","cellular understanding of SARS","host cell pathways","viral replication","central cellular pathways","human cells","host cell modulation","human cell culture model","COVID","results","carbon metabolism","treatment options","coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","nucleic acid metabolism","development of therapy options","proteome proteomics","translatome3","molecular mechanisms","different times","translation","insight","Small molecule inhibitors","inhibition","efforts","identification of drugs","clinical isolate","findings","similarities","analyses","coronaviruses","system","globe1"],"language":"en"}]}

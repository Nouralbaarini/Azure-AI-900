Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is an important cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammatory and immune responses. Although IL-17 family members have been extensively studied in mammals, our knowledge of the activity of IL-17 proteins in teleosts in response to viral infection is still limited. In this study, the role of IL-17 in GCRV infection and its mechanism were investigated. The expression levels of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells gradually increased from 6 h after infection with GCRV. The nuclear translocation of p65, which acts in the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway, was also increased by GCRV infection. The overexpression of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, or IL-17AF3 also promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 and the levels of phospho-I\u03BAB\u03B1 in CIK cells, and reduced the expression of the viral structural protein VP7. An NF-\u03BAB signal inhibitor abolished the inhibition of GCRV infection by IL-17 proteins. These results suggested that the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway was activated by the overexpression of IL-17 proteins, resulting in the inhibition of viral infection. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated that IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 acted as immune cytokines, exerting an antiviral effect by activating the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yunshan; Zhang, Xing; Liang, Zi; Dai, Kun; Zhu, Min; Zhang, Mingtian; Pan, Jun; Xue, Renyu; Cao, Guangli; Tang, Jian; Song, Xuehong; Hu, Xiaolong; Gong, Chengliang","journal":"Aquaculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/388de2b2bf26d85e97af0b86cb1441f017559398.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112052.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848619325062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287459/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0044848619325062; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GCRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IL-17AF2","IL-17AF3","IL-17AF1","role of IL","overexpression of IL","activity of IL","expression levels of IL","inhibition of GCRV infection","inhibition of viral infection","proteins","pathway","NF-\u03BAB signal inhibitor","CIK cells","nuclear translocation of p65","study","grass carp reovirus","grass carp accounts","levels of phospho","critical role","immune cytokines","immune responses","viral structural protein VP7","China","large proportion of aquacultural production","Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney","hemorrhagic disease","teleosts","huge economic losses","antiviral effect","I\u03BAB\u03B1","important cytokine","mammals","industry","knowledge","family members","results","mechanism","conclusion","Interleukin"],"language":"en"},

The situation in Hangzhou was once rather severe as it was once the top ranking city with respect to number of confirmed cases in Zhejiang province at the beginning of the epidemic.

Much later it was shown that immunity is transferable by serum. The active serum components were identified to be immunoglobulins (Ig\u0027s), called antibodies. The enormous diversity of antibodies specific for distinct viruses, pathogens, and many other antigens is explained by clonal selection, whereby specific B-lymphocyte receptors recognize a particular antigen. The selected B-cells are triggered to undergo replication. A process of further cell differentiation and maturation ensues, leading to secretion of antibodies with high binding affinity toward the triggering antigen. Genes coding for the variable regions (involved in antigen binding) of Ig\u0027s are inherited as sets of gene fragments joined to form a complete gene in individual B-cells. This process and further hypermutations ensure the synthesis of diverse high affinity antibodies. The antibodies consist of pairs of light (L) and heavy (H) polypeptide chains. Variations in the constant portion of H-chains lead to production of Ig isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgG (further subdivided into IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4)), each having distinct effector functions. Host exposure to viruses leads to the production of antibodies with more than one specificity. Only some of these antibodies, recognizing so-called virus neutralization epitopes, diminish or eliminate virus infectivity. Other virus-specific antibodies play auxiliary roles or are ineffective. Sometimes antibodies cause enhancement of viral diseases or play a role in evasion of the immune system. Many antiviral immunoglobulins are being used for short-term pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapy. Long-term protective effects can be accomplished only by antibodies elicited by successful vaccination relying on the phenomenon of immunological memory. T-lymphocytes play a major role in initiating and maintaining immunity against subsequent virus exposure. Antibodies are one of the essential features of antigen triggered adaptive immunity. Initial early defense against viruses is provided by components of innate immunity which evolutionarily precedes adaptive immunity, and remains an essential part of defense against pathogens in humans.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neurath, A.

In immune cells, HIV infection is also sensed by several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to type I interferon (IFN-I) and inflammatory cytokines production that upregulate antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several studies suggest a link between these two types of immunity. Indeed, restriction factors, that are generally interferon-inducible, are able to modulate immune responses. This review highlights recent knowledge of the interplay between restriction factors and immunity inducing antiviral defenses.

Few epidemiological studies have been published based solely on DFA and none included respiratory picornaviruses and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We wished to evaluate the use of DFA for epidemiological studies with a long-term observation of respiratory viruses that includes both respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV. METHODS: Since 1998 all children hospitalized with respiratory illness at the University Hospital Bern have been screened with DFA for common respiratory viruses including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, and parainfluenza virus 1-3. In 2006 assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV were added. Here we describe the epidemiological pattern for these respiratory viruses detected by DFA in 10\u0027629 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 8\u0027285 patients during a 12-year period (1998-2010). RESULTS: Addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV raised the proportion of positive DFA results from 35% to 58% (p \u003C 0.0001). Respiratory picornaviruses were the most common viruses detected among patients \u22651 year old. The seasonal patterns and age distribution for the studied viruses agreed well with those reported in the literature. In 2010, an hMPV epidemic of unexpected size was observed. CONCLUSIONS: DFA is a valid, rapid, flexible and inexpensive method. The addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV broadens its range of viral detection. DFA is, even in the \u0022PCR era\u0022, a particularly adapted method for the long term surveillance of respiratory viruses in a pediatric population.","publish_time":"2011-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sadeghi, Christine D; Aebi, Christoph; Gorgievski-Hrisoho, Meri; M\u00FChlemann, Kathrin; Barbani, Maria Teresa","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3044667.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299840/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-41","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFA","University Hospital Bern"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory picornaviruses","common respiratory viruses","detection of respiratory viruses","respiratory illness","long-term observation of respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","long term surveillance of respiratory viruses","common viruses","use of DFA","studied viruses","Addition of assays","proportion of positive DFA results","inexpensive method","epidemiological studies","hMPV epidemic of unexpected size","adapted method","Direct immunofluorescence assays","patients","epidemiological pattern","parainfluenza virus","year period","year old","range of viral detection","adenovirus","RSV","age distribution","University Hospital Bern","BACKGROUND","human metapneumovirus","seasonal patterns","nasopharyngeal aspirates","pediatric population","children","PCR era","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","literature"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis of active infection of the lower respiratory tract is challenging on daily basis in the absence of accurate clinical signs. Clinical scoring systems such as the Californian scoring system, are appealing but were developed without considering the imperfection of reference standard tests used for case definition. This study used a Bayesian latent class model to update Californian prediction rules. The results of clinical examination and ultrasound findings of 608 preweaned dairy calves were used. A model accounting for imperfect accuracy of thoracic ultrasound examination was used to obtain updated weights for the clinical signs included in the Californian scoring system. There were 20 points (95% Bayesian credible intervals: 11\u201329) for abnormal breathing pattern, 16 points (95% BCI: 4\u201329) for ear drop/head tilt, 16 points (95% BCI: 9\u201325) for cough, 10 points (95% BCI: 3\u201318) for the presence of nasal discharge, 7 points (95% BCI: \u22121 to 8) for rectal temperature \u226539.2 \u00B0C, and \u22121 points (95% BCI: \u22129 to 8) for the presence of ocular discharge. The optimal cut-offs were determined using the misclassification cost-term term (MCT) approach with different possible scenarios of expected prevalence and different plausible ratio of false negative costs/false positive costs. The predicted probabilities of active infection of the lower respiratory tract were also obtained using posterior densities of the main logistic regression model. Depending on the context, cut-off varying from 9 to 16 can minimized the MCT. The optimal cut-off decreased when expected prevalence of disease and false negative/false positive ratio increased.","publish_time":"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buczinski, S.; Fecteau, G.; Dubuc, J.; Francoz, D.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7110b5717964ef50369ea682962cfcf68d450a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114123.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758771830028X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891139/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758771830028X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["points","BCI","false positive costs","false positive ratio","Clinical scoring systems","Californian scoring system","lower respiratory tract","results of clinical examination","different plausible ratio of false negative costs","prevalence of disease","model accounting","absence of accurate clinical signs","MCT","Bayesian latent class model","diagnosis of active infection","Californian prediction rules","preweaned dairy calves","presence of nasal discharge","different possible scenarios of expected prevalence","presence of ocular discharge","Abstract Bovine respiratory disease complex","ultrasound findings","misclassification cost-term term","main logistic regression model","predicted probabilities of active infection","optimal cut-offs","imperfect accuracy of thoracic ultrasound examination","Bayesian credible intervals","approach","major cause of illness","posterior densities","daily basis","imperfection of reference standard tests","updated weights","case definition","study","head tilt","abnormal breathing pattern","rectal temperature","ear","context","cough"],"language":"en"},

Broad involvement of PCPs in the pandemic response offered an excellent opportunity to investigate the challenges that they encountered. OBJECTIVE: To examine challenges faced by PCPs as they implemented pandemic policies in Australia, Israel and England before the 2009/A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine became available. METHODS: This is a qualitative descriptive study that employed in-depth semi-structured interviews with 65 PCPs from Australia, Israel and England. The data were analysed thematically to provide a detailed account of the themes. RESULTS: Challenges in three fields of the pandemic response were identified. (i) Consultation of patients was challenged by the high flow of patients, sick and worried-well, the necessity to provide personalised information about the disease during consultations, and unfamiliar antiviral treatment. (ii) Performance of public health responsibilities was complicated in regards to patient segregation and introduction of personal protection measures. (iii) Communication with the health authorities was inefficient, with no established route to provide feedback about the pandemic policies. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of the 2009/A/H1N1 pandemic highlighted the centrality of primary care in the pandemic response. Despite intensive pre-pandemic planning, numerous barriers for implementation of the pandemic policies in primary care were identified. Investigation of three different approaches for involvement of PCPs in the pandemic management showed that none of these approaches worked smoothly.","publish_time":"2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kunin, Marina; Engelhard, Dan; Thomas, Shane; Ashworth, Mark; Piterman, Leon","journal":"Isr J Health Policy Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d1ca8ed239b0d50c0dc8a21041a1a1c43045806.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4606524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473026/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-015-0028-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Australia","Israel"],"keyphrases":["pandemic response","pandemic management","H1N1 pandemic vaccine","principal implementers of pandemic policies","intensive pre-pandemic planning","challenges","Broad involvement of PCPs","primary care physicians","centrality of primary care","patient management","Australia","Israel","England","patient segregation","health authorities","different approaches","Consultation of patients","high flow of patients","Performance of public health responsibilities","numerous barriers","in-depth semi-structured interviews","implementation","consultations","regards","qualitative descriptive study","disease","introduction of personal protection measures","main burden","personalised information","established route","feedback","fields","excellent opportunity","unfamiliar antiviral treatment","necessity","Communication","Investigation","detailed account","themes","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","experience","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","data"],"language":"en"},

To describe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient presentations requiring otolaryngology consultation and provide recommendations for protective measures based on the experience of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments in 4 Chinese hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design. Retrospective case series. Setting. Multicenter. Subjects and Methods. Twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring ENT consultation from 3 designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were identified. Data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and severity, consult reason, treatment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected and analyzed. Infection control strategies implemented for ENT outpatients and emergency room visits at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University were reported. Results. Median age was 63 years, 55% were male, and 95% were in severe or critical condition. Six tracheotomies were performed. Posttracheotomy outcomes were mixed (2 deaths, 2 patients comatose, all living patients still hospitalized). Other consults included epistaxis, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, hyposmia, rhinitis, otitis externa, dizziness, and tinnitus. At all hospitals, powered air-supply filter respirators (PAPRs) were used for tracheotomy or bleeding control. PAPR or N95-equivalent masks plus full protective clothing were used for other complaints. No inpatient ENT providers were infected. After implementation of infection control strategies for outpatient clinics, emergency visits, and surgeries, no providers were infected at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University. Conclusions and Relevance. COVID-19 patients require ENT consultation for many reasons, including tracheotomy. Otolaryngologists play an indispensable role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but, due to their work, are at high risk of exposure. Appropriate protective strategies can prevent infection of otolaryngologists.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Chong; Yao, Qi; Zhang, Di; Zhao, Yu; Zhang, Kun; Nisenbaum, Eric; Cao, Pengyu; Zhao, Keqing; Huang, Xiaolong; Leng, Dewen; Liu, Chunhan; Li, Ning; Luo, Yan; Chen, Bing; Casiano, Roy; Weed, Donald; Sargi, Zoukaa; Telischi, Fred; Lu, Hongzhou; Denneny, James C.; Shu, Yilai; Liu, Xuezhong","journal":"Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b479b46a57cf265ca37d83d90b7397cf1e84df86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7218357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396445/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820926144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Design","ENT","PPE","PAPR","ENT Hospital","Fudan University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ENT consultation","treatment of COVID","hospitalized COVID","ENT outpatients","designated COVID","inpatient ENT providers","ENT Hospital of Fudan University","patients comatose","Appropriate protective strategies","protective measures","protective clothing","implementation of infection control strategies","infection of otolaryngologists","Eye","personal protective equipment","otolaryngology consultation","Chinese hospitals","emergency visits","bleeding control","emergency room","outpatient clinics","nasal congestion","rhinitis","hyposmia","powered air-supply filter respirators","otitis externa","pharyngitis","PAPRs","recommendations","Wuhan","N95-equivalent masks","patient presentations","epistaxis","dizziness","experience of ear","PPE","use","deaths","comorbidities","nose","throat","symptoms","surgeries","severity","departments","indispensable role","reasons","years","consults","tinnitus","Shanghai","work","Data","demographics","high risk of exposure","Retrospective case series","critical condition","Median age","Posttracheotomy outcomes","Shenzhen","complaints","coronavirus disease","pandemic","Study Design","Subjects","Methods","Conclusions","Relevance"],"language":"en"},

In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a birth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation, Bertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not revisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several new cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases to get a better understanding of this death\u2013birth coupling phenomenon. The largest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in 1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the Twin Tower attack on September 11, 2001. We shall see that the first of these events indeed produced an extra dip in births whereas the 9/11 event did not. This disparity highlights the pivotal role of collateral sufferers. In the last section it is shown how the present coupling leads to predictions; it can explain in a unified way effects which so far have been studied separately, as for instance the impact on birth rates of heat waves. Thus, it appears that behind the apparent randomness of birth rate fluctuations there are in fact hidden explanatory factors.","publish_time":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richmond, Peter; Roehner, Bertrand M.","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61df7f40f7768c73817562e5c0878dcaa0b41f4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125919.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437118304746; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2018.04.044; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437118304746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jacques Bertillon"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tokyo"],"keyphrases":["birth numbers","birth coupling phenomenon","new cases of massive death spikes","largest death spikes","wake","birth rates of heat waves","extra dip","months","apparent randomness of birth rate fluctuations","Jacques Bertillon","present coupling leads","recent influenza pandemics","better understanding","impact","Tokyo","pioneer of medical statistics","pivotal role of collateral sufferers","Twin Tower attack","earthquakes","disparity","predictions","births","instance","result of excess deaths","explanatory factors","unified way effects","population","events","spite","Abstract","section","observation","time","aim","addition"],"language":"en"},

One must integrate knowledge of the genomes of pathogens with host biology and geography to understand the etiology of epidemics.

To build this application, we created a web service for integrated sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis as well as methods to describe the tree, mutations, and host shifts in Keyhole Markup Language (KML). We apply the application to 239 sequences of the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene of recent isolates of avian influenza (H5N1). We map a mutation, glutamic acid to lysine at position 627 in the PB2 protein (E627K), in H5N1 influenza that allows for increased replication of the virus in mammals.

OBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011\u20132013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value \u003C 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value \u003C 0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort. CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.","publish_time":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cebey-L\u00F3pez, Miriam; Herberg, Jethro; Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; G\u00F3mez-Carballa, Alberto; Martin\u00F3n-Torres, Nazareth; Salas, Antonio; Martin\u00F3n-S\u00E1nchez, Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa; Justicia, Antonio; Rivero-Calle, Irene; Sumner, Edward; Fink, Colin; Martin\u00F3n-Torres, Federico","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/058b0cc7cecd43d80ed47196cb5376fa10efb58a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4838299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27096199/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["UK","PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["P-value","respiratory viruses","terms of severity","respiratory distress","respiratory secretions","respiratory support requirement","increased severity","markers of severity","clinical phenotype","hospitalized children","acute respiratory infections","ARI","UK cohort","higher clinical score","lower clinical score","replication cohort","independent cohort","main cohort","detailed clinical information","major clinical impact","significance of co-infection","presence of viral co-infection","pneumococcal vaccination","Multiple viruses","bacterial superinfection","PICU admission","number of detected viruses","Findings","terms of degree","protective factor","protective role","approach","pathogenesis","Spanish prospective multicenter study","PCR","GENDRES network","nested polymerase chain reaction","outcome","longer hospital length of stay","METHODS","disease course","oxygen necessity","BACKGROUND","addition","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although asymptomatic in a large percentage of cases, however toroviruses may pose a potential threat to worsen disease outcome in concurrent infections with other enteric pathogens. Previous studies based on the analysis of limited numbers of samples indicated high seroprevalences against porcine torovirus (PToV) in various European countries. The aim of this work was to perform a seroepidemiological survey of PToV in Spanish farms in order to define the seroprevalence against this virus. RESULTS: Serum samples (n = 2664) from pigs of different ages were collected from 100 Spanish farms coming from 10 regions that concentrate 96.1% of the 3392 farms with 80 or more sows censused in Spain. Samples were screened by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant PToV nucleocapsid protein as antigen. The analysis of the whole serum collection yielded a total of 95.7% (2550/2664) seropositive samples. The highest prevalence (99.6%, 1382/1388) and ELISA values (average O.D. \u00B1 standard deviation) were observed in the sows (1.03\u00B10.36) and the lowest prevalence (59.4%, 98/165) and anti-PToV IgG levels (0.45\u00B10.16) were found amongst 3-week-old piglets. Both ELISA reactivity values and seroprevalence percentages rose quickly with piglet\u2019s age from 3 to 11 weeks of age; the seroprevalence was 99.3% (2254/2270) when only the samples from sows and pigs over 11-weeks of age were considered. Antibodies against PToV were detected in all analyzed farms. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the results of the largest torovirus seroepidemiological survey in farmed swine performed so far. Overall, the seroprevalence against PToV in animals older than 11 weeks of age was \u003E99%, indicating that this virus is endemic in pig herds from Spain.","publish_time":"2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alonso-Padilla, Julio; Pignatelli, Jaime; Simon-Grif\u00E9, Meritxell; Plazuelo, Susana; Casal, Jordi; Rodr\u00EDguez, Dolores","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77df4e88903b7ecce476bfe74de088ece28f7e10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3556161.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-5-675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23217216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["weeks of age","Serum samples","seroepidemiological survey of PToV","Spanish farms","seropositive samples","sows","Torovirus infections","ELISA values","seroprevalence percentages","piglet\u2019s age","analyzed farms","recombinant PToV nucleocapsid protein","anti-PToV IgG levels","analysis of limited numbers of samples","largest torovirus seroepidemiological survey","porcine torovirus","RESULTS","ELISA reactivity values","Spain","pigs of different ages","concurrent infections","animals older","young animals","serum collection","highest prevalence","lowest prevalence","high seroprevalences","disease outcome","toroviruses","horses","cows","gastroenteritis","humans","farmed swine","immune-sorbent assay","potential threat","large percentage of cases","diarrhea","pig herds","antigen","standard deviation","various European countries","order","indirect enzyme","enteric pathogens","report","work","Previous studies","total","CONCLUSIONS","children","BACKGROUND","regions","week-old piglets","aim","Antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Eight cold-temperature indices, average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and the temperature humidity index, wind chill index, apparent temperature, effective temperature (ET), and net effective temperature and their standardized Z scores were applied to distributed lag non-linear models. Index-specific cumulative 26-day (lag 0\u201325) mortality risk, cumulative 8-day (lag 0\u20137) outpatient visit risk, and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated at 1 and 2 standardized deviations below the median temperature, comparing with the Z score of the lowest risks for mortality and outpatient visits. The average temperature was adequate to evaluate the mortality risk from all causes and circulatory diseases. Excess all-cause mortality increased for 17\u201324% when average temperature was at Z=\u22121, and for 27\u201341% at Z=\u22122 among study areas. The cold-temperature indices were inconsistent in estimating risk of outpatient visits. Average temperature and THI were appropriate indices for measuring risk for all-cause outpatient visits. Relative risk of all-cause outpatient visits increased slightly by 2\u20137% when average temperature was at Z=\u22121, but no significant risk at Z=\u22122. Minimum temperature estimated the strongest risk associated with outpatient visits of respiratory diseases. In conclusion, the relationships between cold temperatures and health varied among study areas, types of health event, and the cold-temperature indices applied. Mortality from all causes and circulatory diseases and outpatient visits of respiratory diseases has a strong association with cold temperatures in the subtropical island, Taiwan.","publish_time":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yu-Kai; Wang, Yu-Chun; Lin, Pay-Liam; Li, Ming-Hsu; Ho, Tsung-Jung","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abf711d63c1164c213353af773e916b2c061004f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23764675/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969713005731; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713005731","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern Taiwan","Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["average temperature","apparent temperature","median temperature","mortality risk","optimal cold-temperature indices","temperature humidity index","estimating risk of outpatient visits","net effective temperature","outpatient visits of respiratory diseases","cold temperatures","Relative risk of all-cause outpatient visits","strongest risk","significant risk","cold seasons","circulatory diseases","Excess all-cause mortality","cardiopulmonary diseases","appropriate indices","causes","standardized Z scores","elevated risks of mortality","minimum temperatures","study areas","Index-specific cumulative","day","wind chill index","lowest risks","distributed lag non-linear models","standardized deviations","Southern Taiwan","types of health event","strong association","maximum","THI","subtropical island","relationships","conclusion","confidence intervals"],"language":"en"},

All participants were asked to complete a self-administered closed-ended questionnaire about their knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding the use of face masks. Data were described using descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients. Results Among the 399 respondents, 52% knew the correct steps in wearing a face mask, and their attitudes toward face masks were generally positive. Further analyses showed that respondents were more likely to wear a face mask at a clinic than in a public place or at home. Moreover, respondents were more likely to wear a face mask to protect others against influenza-like illness (ILI) than for self-protection. There was low to moderate correlation between attitudes and practices (correlation coefficient 0.26, P \u003C 0.05). Conclusions This study identified a knowledge gap in the correct use of face masks among outpatients and their caregivers; attitudes and practices regarding the use of face masks were generally positive, but correlation was not high.

How they impact cystic fibrosis lung disease history in young children is poorly known. The principal aim of our study was to determinate respiratory tract infections frequency in this cystic fibrosis young population. Secondary outcomes were nature of viral agents recovered and impact of such infections. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 25 children affected by cystic fibrosis and aged less than 2 years. Nasal samplings were taken systematically monthly or bimonthly with additional samples taken during respiratory tract infections episodes. Ten pathogens were tested by a combination of five duplex RT-PCRs or PCRs: influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV)), coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43), parainfluenza virus (1\u20134), adenovirus and bocavirus (Respiratory Multi-Well System MWS r-gene\u00AE, BioM\u00E9rieux, Marcy l\u2019\u00C9toile, France). Cycle thresholds (CTs) were reported for all positive samples and considered positive for values below 40. Quantitative variables were compared using a nonparametric statistical test (Wilcoxon signed rank for paired comparisons). Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess relationships between two variables. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or GraphPad Prism V6.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The significance level was set at 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age at inclusion was 9.6 \u00B1 6.7 months. The patients had 3.4 \u00B1 1.7 respiratory tract infections episodes per child per year. Forty-four respiratory tract infections (69%) were associated with virus: rhinovirus and enterovirus (RV/EV) were implied in 61% of them and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 14%. Only one patient required hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections. 86% of the patients were treated by antibiotics for a mean of 13.8 \u00B1 6.2 days. RSV infections (n = 6) were usually of mild severity. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory tract infections in young children with cystic fibrosis were of mild severity, rarely requiring hospitalization. Unsurprisingly, RV/EV were the most frequent agents. RSV-related morbidity seems low in this population. This raises the question of the usefulness of RSV preventive medication in this young population.","publish_time":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eymery, Mathilde; Morfin, Florence; Doleans-Jordheim, Anne; Perceval, Marie; Ohlmann, Camille; Mainguy, Catherine; Reix, Philippe","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/009892e02bc1a4c9abf6f547b979e68ecbde8087.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6724274.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1208-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marcy","Pearson"],"organizations":["SAS Institute","RSV"],"locations":["France","Wilcoxon","La Jolla"],"keyphrases":["Viral respiratory tract infections","respiratory tract infections episodes","RSV infections","lower respiratory tract infections","determinate respiratory tract infections frequency","respiratory syncytial virus","cystic fibrosis young population","young children","RV","parainfluenza virus","RSV-related morbidity","cystic fibrosis lung disease history","rhinovirus","usefulness of RSV preventive medication","USA","positive samples","enterovirus","hospitalization","mild severity","impact","patients","nature of viral agents","GraphPad Software","SAS Institute","SAS v9","additional samples","Statistical analyses","frequent agents","mean age","Quantitative variables","GraphPad Prism V6","nonparametric statistical test","duplex RT-PCRs","prospective cohort study","System MWS r-gene","Wilcoxon","rank","BioM\u00E9rieux","bocavirus","metapneumovirus","early childhood","NL63","Marcy l\u2019\u00C9toile","inclusion","combination","HKU1","OC43","Jolla","Secondary outcomes","Cary","coronavirus","MPV","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","paired comparisons","France","CTs","RESULTS","Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient","question","adenovirus","values","principal aim","Cycle thresholds","Nasal samplings","METHODS","antibiotics","relationships","significance level","months","pathogens","days","years"],"language":"en"},

These diseases have become more prominent in the wake of policies to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production. This has led to more research focused on better understanding the immune system and its responses to pathogen challenge, and thus developing informed strategies to exploit immune responses that can support enhanced disease resistance and growth performance. Some chicken breeds and lines show greater resistance or susceptibility to various diseases, and thus these birds maybe able to shed light on immune processes or pathways that contribute to the more resistant/susceptible state. This review attempts to identify potentially important genes that show some consistency in (relative) up or downregulation in key tissues between the resistant and susceptible chickens. For coccidiosis and NE, relative downregulation of IL-10 and (slightly less consistently) upregulation of IFN-\u03B3 appear to be features of more resistant birds. Data for IFN-\u03B1, IL-12, and IL-17D are currently less consistent. Gene expression data from NE studies have identified some potentially interesting, perhaps less well understood, immune-related genes (e.g., TCF12, BCL2, IRF2, TRAF3, TAB3, etc.,) that maybe associated with the resistant and/or susceptible phenotype. Salmonella and Campylobacter are important foodborne pathogens harbored by the chicken intestinal tract, while infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis are also important viral diseases of poultry. We, therefore, consider whether there are consistent features from resistant/susceptible disease models with these pathogens that relate to findings from the coccidiosis and NE studies. It is not anticipated that ideal immune responses to these pathogens will be identical but rather that consistent elements maybe identified that could help inform breeding or alternative strategies to support general disease resistance and enhanced (and efficient) flock productivity.","publish_time":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broom, Leon J; Kogut, Michael H","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cded487793694de49b640b3972285bfc8431cfb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c4e317ea69d445f560153e21ce5adad872131bc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6414032.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119300914; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30534980/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119300914","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resistant birds","enhanced disease resistance","susceptible disease models","NE studies","ideal immune responses","immune processes","immune system","Coccidiosis","general disease resistance","immune-related genes","important genes","important viral diseases of poultry","various diseases","significant diseases","susceptible chickens","susceptible state","susceptible phenotype","consistent features","infectious bursal disease","important foodborne pathogens","relative downregulation of IL","greater resistance","consistent elements","infectious bronchitis","chicken breeds","alternative strategies","informed strategies","poultry industry","IFN-\u03B1","upregulation of IFN","chicken intestinal tract","Gene expression data","BCL2","TCF12","lines","light","pathogen challenge","susceptibility","key tissues","use of antibiotics","IRF2","TRAF3","Salmonella","Campylobacter","pathways","growth performance","findings","wake of policies","animal production","TAB3","breeding","review attempts","necrotic enteritis","consistency","flock productivity","research"],"language":"en"},

Canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and sometimes causes even fatal cases. Here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 may a recombinant variant between CCoV\u2013I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the unknown functions. In a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine coronavirus in China based on the available sequences, which is urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Hai-Jian; Zhang, Wenyan; Liang, Jiawei; Lu, Meng; Wang, Ruyi; Li, Gairu; He, Jia-Wei; Chen, Jun; Chen, Jun; Xing, Gang; Chen, Ye","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22cf6aaf9f7f07851592c1b9a1015275b21d5980.json; document_parses/pdf_json/411a8d04e9a5333a59969c4c8b489a9ea04fadc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165111.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401020304964?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311431/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401020304964; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["current CCoV-IIa strains","new subtype CCoV","classic CCoV-IIa strains","evolution of canine coronavirus","canine kobuvirus","canine astrovirus","canine parvovirus","strain B906","evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus","Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes","China","ZJ","previous strain A76","complete spike gene","recombinant variant","Recombination analysis of B906","Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene","complete genomes","Co-infection","available sequences","prevalent subtype","fecal samples","known subtypes","limited sequences data","CaKV","CPV","Torque teno canis virus","devise of future effective disease prevention","TTCaV","CaAstV","control strategies","nucleotide","etiology","spite","recent years","dog population","diarrheic pet dogs","prevalence","amino acid variations","useful information","unknown functions","word","fatal cases","outbreaks of COVID","attention of people"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have identified Ser190, Ser192, Thr378 and Ser379 as the phosphorylation sites for coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N protein. In this study, we show that phosphorylation at Thr378 and Ser379 sites is dependent on the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR), a kinase activated during IBV replication. Introduction of Ala substitutions at these two sites individually, in combination of the two and together with other two sites (Ser190 and Ser192) into an infectious IBV clone did not affect recovery of the recombinant viruses containing the mutations. A mutant virus (rIBV-Nm4) carrying the four Ala substitutions grew at a similar, if not better, growth rate as wild type virus. This study reveals a cellular kinase responsible for phosphorylation of a coronavirus N protein at two positions and the functional consequence of this modification on coronavirus replication.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Shouguo; Xu, Linghui; Huang, Mei; Qisheng Li, Frank; Liu, D.

To identify the molecular characteristics of the PEDV Spike (S) gene in Mexico, 116 samples of the intestine and diarrhea of piglets with clinical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) were obtained. Samples were collected from 14 farms located in six states of Mexico (Jalisco, Puebla, Sonora, Veracruz, Guanajuato, and Michoac\u00E1n) from 2013 to 2016. To identify PEDV, we used real-time RT-PCR to discriminate between non-INDEL and INDEL strains. We chose samples according to state and year to characterize the S gene. After amplification of the S gene, the obtained products were sequenced and assembled. The complete amino acid sequences of the spike protein were used to perform an epitope analysis, which was used to determine null mutations in regions SS2, SS6, and 2C10 compared to the sequences of G2. A phylogenetic analysis determined the circulation of G2b and INDEL strains in Mexico. However, several mutations were recorded in the collagenase equivalent (COE) region that were related to the change in polarity and charge of the amino acid residues. The PEDV strain circulating in Jalisco in 2016 has an insertion of three amino acids ((232)LGL(234)) and one change in the antigenic site of the COE region, and strains from the years 2015 and 2016 changed the index of the surface probability, which could be related to the re-emergence of disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lara-Romero, Roc\u00EDo; G\u00F3mez-N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Luis; Cerrite\u00F1o-S\u00E1nchez, Jos\u00E9 Luis; M\u00E1rquez-Valdelamar, Laura; Mendoza-Elvira, Susana; Ram\u00EDrez-Mendoza, Humberto; Rivera-Ben\u00EDtez, Jos\u00E9 Francisco","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e31c7e67f3b134791cbe0adf9f4c636540a2656.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29243063/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-017-1528-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","INDEL","COE"],"locations":["Mexico","Veracruz","Jalisco"],"keyphrases":["PEDV Spike","S gene","INDEL strains","samples","states of Mexico","PEDV strain","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","diarrhea of piglets","amino acid residues","Jalisco","complete amino acid sequences","COE region","non-INDEL","amino acids","change","clinical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhea","circulation of G2b","spike protein","null mutations","sequences of G2","outbreaks suggestive","phylogenetic analysis","epitope analysis","obtained products","re-emergence of disease outbreaks","Puebla","2C10","regions SS2","SS6","Veracruz","Sonora","charge","intestine","Guanajuato","antigenic site","collagenase equivalent","polarity","real-time RT-PCR","molecular characteristics","index","insertion","years","farms","surface probability","Michoac\u00E1n","LGL","amplification","beginning"],"language":"en"},

The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in nonhuman animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV\u2013IFN-\u03B2) was shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV\u2013IFN-\u03B2 also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV\u2013IFN-\u03B2 against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mouse model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have suggested that proinflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aims to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that have shown potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez, Miguel Angel","journal":"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c527438049b676f616cfaa429333081f0e4e602d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152082/; https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00399-20","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","fighting SARS-CoV","novel human coronavirus infections","novel human respiratory coronavirus","replication of SARS","coronavirus disease","emerging novel coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","IFN-\u03B2","LPV","RTV","pathogenic infections","Ebola virus infections","therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir","previous epidemics of infections","high-morbidity human coronaviruses","human immunodeficiency virus type","summary of therapeutic compounds","therapeutic alternatives","clinical trials","clinical parameters","characterization of compounds","high mortality rates","HIV","interferon beta","ritonavir","protease inhibitors lopinavir","combination","marmosets","mice","COVID","transgenic humanized mouse model","nucleotide analog prodrug","tissue cultures","GS","expansion","role","generated inflammatory state","nonhuman animal models","promising compound","need","patients","proinflammatory responses","addition","nCoV","new epidemic","pathogenesis","minireview","Therapeutics"],"language":"en"},

Examination of the urinary bladder revealed either diffuse irregular thickening (three cases) or petechiation (one case) of the mucosa. On histopathological examination, urocystitis with submucosal histiocytic, lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration and neutrophil transmigration through the urothelium was noted in all cases.

We analyzed the research and development (R\u0026D) budget of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. METHODS: The 2018 MOHW R\u0026D Project integrated implementation plan was used to analyze the R\u0026D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk factors were compared with corresponding budgets. RESULTS: In 2018, the MOHW major R\u0026D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R\u0026D budget, 35.9% was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were targeted for R\u0026D. CONCLUSIONS: It would be difficult to say that current R\u0026D allocations focus to minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R\u0026D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a similar finding for risk factors R\u0026D. A novel approach for allocating government R\u0026D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the Korean population should be considered.","publish_time":"2019-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, So-Youn; Yoon, Seok-Jun; Park, Hyesook; Jo, Min-Woo; Oh, In-Hwan","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7220982ea4592afc5109160c63d728f1fdaa8373.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6434158.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e81; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOHW","KNBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease burden","MOHW R","allocated budget","disease specific R","D budget of USD","risk factors R","government R","budget targets","budget lines","current R","MOHW major R","Korean National Burden of Disease","total government budget","D funding","D allocations","communicable disease groups","healthcare budget allocation","KNBD disease group","terms of economic burden","DALYs of attributable risk factors","behavioral risk","D Project integrated implementation plan","results","Korean population","non-communicable diseases","novel approach","disability","climate change","life years","Ministry of Health","similar finding","development","corresponding budgets","Welfare","level","neoplasm","goal","research","study","injury","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","violence","mismatch"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a review of molecular and serological investigations through PubMed and EMBASE from September 2012 to November 15, 2018, to measure subclinical or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection within and outside of health-care settings. We performed retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported to the World Health Organization to November 27, 2018, to summarize what is known about asymptomatic infections identified through national surveillance systems. We identified 23 studies reporting evidence of MERS-CoV infection outside of health-care settings, mainly of camel workers, with seroprevalence ranges of 0%\u201367% depending on the study location. We identified 20 studies in health-care settings of health-care worker (HCW) and family contacts, of which 11 documented molecular evidence of MERS-CoV infection among asymptomatic contacts. Since 2012, 298 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported as asymptomatic to the World Health Organization, 164 of whom were HCWs. The potential to transmit MERS-CoV to others has been demonstrated in viral-shedding studies of asymptomatic MERS infections. Our results highlight the possibility for onward transmission of MERS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals. Screening of HCW contacts of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV is currently recommended, but systematic screening of non-HCW contacts outside of health-care facilities should be encouraged.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grant, Rebecca; Malik, Mamunur Rahman; Elkholy, Amgad; Van Kerkhove, Maria D","journal":"Epidemiol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fc2b56a2a63b8539cfdad2f6b623b2e013af2d1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3c4eba7fc5ef54aefffff3808827f42c862cf20c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108493.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781765/; https://doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxz009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","HCW"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infections","asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection","confirmed MERS-CoV","health-care settings of health","asymptomatic contacts","health-care facilities","onward transmission of MERS","viral-shedding studies of asymptomatic MERS infections","role of asymptomatic infections","World Health Organization","asymptomatic individuals","documented molecular evidence of MERS","care worker","extent of infection","family contacts","Screening of HCW contacts of patients","human transmission","systematic screening of non-HCW contacts","limited human","review of molecular","retrospective analysis of laboratory","epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","dromedary camels","serological investigations","camel workers","recurrent zoonotic spillover","PubMed","possibility","national surveillance systems","EMBASE","seroprevalence ranges","results","cases","potential","study location","HCWs"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Twelve patients with cDGS underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. OBJECTIVE: We sought to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center. RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44 \u00D7 10(6)/L (range, 11-440 \u00D7 10(6)/L) and 200 \u00D7 10(6)/L (range, 5-310 \u00D7 10(6)/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/10(6) T cells (range, 320-8,807/10(6) T cells) and 4,184/10(6) T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/10(6) T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications were seen in 7 of 12 patients. In 2 patients early transient autoimmune hemolysis settled after treatment and did not recur. The other 5 experienced ongoing autoimmune problems, including thyroiditis (3), hemolysis (1), thrombocytopenia (4), and neutropenia (1). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the previous reports that thymus transplantation can reconstitute T cells in patients with cDGS but with frequent autoimmune complications in survivors.","publish_time":"2017-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, E.

In this work, four independent air dehumidification systems with energy recovery strategies are proposed. They are as follows: system 1, mechanical dehumidification with heat pump; system 2, mechanical dehumidification with sensible heat exchanger; system 3, mechanical dehumidification with membrane-based total heat exchanger; and system 4: a heat pump incorporating an active desiccant wheel and evaporative cooler. They are compared with a mechanical dehumidification system with no heat recovery. Hour-by-hour energy analysis is performed on the systems proposed. The results show that the system of mechanical dehumidification with membrane total heat recovery (system 3) consumes the least primary energy.

To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity. In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients. Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease. Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xinhui; Fang, Xuexian; Cai, Zhaoxian; Wu, Xiaotian; Gao, Xiaotong; Min, Junxia; Wang, Fudi","journal":"Research (Wash D C)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0439b551a59ce8f8cf16c693e8b155dab9944d9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377638/; https://doi.org/10.34133/2020/2402961","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased risk of COVID","severe COVID","increased disease severity","cardiovascular disease","chronic kidney disease","infectious disease","chronic liver disease","outcome of patients","recent outbreak of COVID","clinical course","clinical strategies","high-risk patients","additional clinical data","major clinical characteristics","high risk of comorbidity","acute kidney injury","high mortality rate","chronic conditions","effect of risk factors","related mortality","acute cardiac injury","new insights","development of severe","new guidelines","pathophysiological parameters","tissue damage","hypertension","causative virus","order","management","specific vaccine","novel coronavirus","fatal complications","organ function","respect","findings","correlation","diabetes","SARS-CoV","studies","pathophysiology","mechanism","supportive therapy","concerns","date","effective medicine","approach","global scale"],"language":"en"},

Hence, it is important to identify effective antiviral agents against FMDV infection. In this study, we found that mizoribine has potent antiviral activity against FMDV replication in IBRS-2 cells. A time-of-drug-addition assay demonstrated that mizoribine functions at the early stage of replication. Moreover, mizoribine also showed antiviral effect on FMDV in vivo.

This retrospective study was conducted over a nine-year period and used 7283 influenza-negative respiratory samples from hospitalized and deceased patients who presented Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The samples were processed with the help of qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for simultaneous detection of 14 respiratory viruses (xTAG(\u00AE) RVP FAST v2). 40.8% of the samples were positive for respiratory viruses, mainly rhinovirus/enterovirus (47.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), HMPV (11.1%) and parainfluenza virus (8.9%). Other respiratory viruses and co-infections accounted for 16.5%. HMPV infects all age groups, but the most affected group was infants between 29 days and 9 years of age (65.6%) and adults who are 40 years and older (25.7%). HMPV circulates every year from November to April, and the highest circulation was observed in late winter.

At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings of lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative diagnosis (1). To rapidly understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, SCCPHD, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and CDC began sentinel surveillance in Santa Clara County. During March 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites. For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers. A convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza virus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza. Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection. This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies. Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2). Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide a robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zwald, Marissa L.; Lin, Wen; Sondermeyer Cooksey, Gail L.; Weiss, Charles; Suarez, Angela; Fischer, Marc; Bonin, Brandon J.; Jain, Seema; Langley, Gayle E.; Park, Benjamin J.; Moulia, Danielle; Benedict, Rory; Nguyen, Nang; Han, George S.","journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6972a6876b4911bf69c9ee54134716af72ecf51a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271724/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Santa Clara County Public Health Department","California Department of Public Health","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["community transmission of SARS","confirmed COVID","probable community transmission","Detection of community transmission","county residents","epidemiology of COVID","extent of COVID","Santa Clara County Public Health Department","sentinel surveillance system","mortality surveillance","persons","community mitigation measures","SARS-CoV","known source of transmission","series of community mitigation strategies","sentinel sites","hospital-based surveillance","travel","respiratory symptoms","testing criteria","known exposure","testing guidance","investigation protocols","severe respiratory disease","SCCPHD","known risk","negative test results","influenza virus","urgent care centers","patients","California Department of Public Health","positive test results","case of coronavirus disease","quarantine guidance","inclusion criteria","evidence of infection","clinical findings of lower respiratory illness","convenience sample of specimens","close contact","response activities","affected area","emergency departments","increasing number of cases","CDPH","serologic surveys","outpatient settings","CDC","epidemiologic link","cough","data","robust approach","fever","alternative diagnosis","laboratory","shortness of breath","time"],"language":"en"},

The 90-day study had a 28-day recovery period. Treatments for the 14-day non-recovery range-finding study were 0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg test article/kg body weight (bw)/day for 14 days. There was a non-statistically significant (p \u003E 0.05) decrease in body weights for the male and female rats receiving the test article. Hypoactivity, hyperactivity, reduced food consumption and piloerection were observed in the rats receiving 4000 mg test article/kg bw. Histopathology showed an increase in the size of liver cells (hypertrophy) around the central vein (centrilobular) in Groups 3 (3/10) and 4 (5/10) that correlated with increased liver weights. In the 90-day study, 8 groups of rats were dosed with 0, 200, 400 and 800 mg test article/kg bw/day. Groups 5 to 8 had a 28-day recovery. There were no test article-linked changes in clinical observations, physical examinations, Functional Observation Battery, ophthalmology, Motor Activity Assessment, hematology, clinical chemistries and macropathology (all groups). With the exception of the liver and adrenal gland, no test article-linked pathology was observed. For all rats receiving the test article, histopathology showed hypertrophy of liver cells around the central vein. The increase of liver weight is most likely caused by hypertrophy due to up-regulation of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. The hepatocellular hypertrophy was completely reversed in 28 days and was not considered to be an adverse effect. Vacuolization of the adrenal zona fasciculata was observed in the control and 800 mg test article/kg bw groups. The vacuolization of the zona fasciculata was of the same incidence and severity in treatment and control male rats and correlated with an increased in the weights of the adrenal glands. In addition, a statistically significant increase (p\u003C0.05) in adrenal-to-body weight ratios was observed for females receiving 800 mg test article/kg bw. This increase in adrenal-to-body weight ratio did not correlate with any of the pathology findings. The NOAEL for the test article is 800 mg/kg bw/day for female and 400 mg/kg bw/day for male Sprague Dawley rats.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dziwenka, Margitta; Coppock, Robert; Alexander, McCorkle; Palumbo, Eddie; Ramirez, Carlos; Lermer, Stephen","journal":"Toxicol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bfc2c373683e0a176cb061bc890ca097ce55d60.json; document_parses/pdf_json/140ab046d55c6618aa71fea9e48b7971a7e4b60e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7036713.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750019305207; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214750019305207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123668/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.02.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMES","CYP","GLP","Functional Observation Battery","Motor Activity Assessment"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["day study","test article-linked pathology","test article-linked changes","bw groups","day toxicity study","groups of rats","day recovery period","increase of liver weight","day non-recovery range","control male rats","female rats","hypertrophy of liver cells","body weights","increased liver weights","body weight ratios","adrenal zona fasciculata","adrenal glands","significant increase","male Sprague Dawley rats","size of liver cells","hepatocellular hypertrophy","hemp extract","hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes","central vein","Histopathology","CBD","proprietary extract of","Vacuolization","olive oil","days","hepatic drug metabolizing mix","clinical observations","clinical chemistries","CYP enzymes","mutagenic potential","potential benefits","Cannabis sativa","pathology findings","ophthalmology","Functional Observation Battery","physical examinations","Motor Activity Assessment","hematology","S9","rich","AMES assay inclusive","hyperactivity","reduced food consumption","piloerection","incidence","severity","regulation","females","Hypoactivity","macropathology","cannabinoid Cannabidiol","focus","evidence of bacterial mutagenicity","safety","centrilobular","exception","variety of medicinal purposes","Cannabinoids","addition","GLP compliant","Treatments","NOAEL","adverse effect"],"language":"en"},

The distribution of bovine norovirus infections was investigated by both RT-PCR to detect norovirus genomes and a virus-like particles-based ELISA to detect genotype 2 bovine norovirus antibodies. During a 1-year systematic study, a virus prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) (10 out of 133 samples) was found in stool samples from diarrhoeic calves screened by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing performed on the polymerase region classified all the norovirus amplicons in the bovine norovirus genotype 2. Rather surprisingly, some rotavirus sequences were also detected. On the basis of the polymerase region, genotype 1 bovine norovirus was not identified. Other enteropathogens were found in all samples. By ELISA, a genotype 2 seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95.3%]) was found from calves and adult cattle. Antibody levels against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses rose in the first 6 months of life and were maintained in adults. Together the results of virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine norovirus infection occurs early in life and that re-infection with serologically related bovine noroviruses strains could occur in adult cattle as reported for rotaviruses. The antibody rise against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses in the adult cattle also suggests a short lived and/or strain specific immunity as already shown in human noroviruses. Genotype 2 bovine noroviruses are endemic in the region investigated.","publish_time":"2009-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mauroy, Axel; Scipioni, Alexandra; Mathijs, Elisabeth; Saegerman, Claude; Mast, Jan; Bridger, Janice C.; Ziant, Dominique; Thys, Christine; Thiry, Etienne","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fb5ea6e190174cfdb2b7b5bef10bb37c5fa2eaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117358.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509000522; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509000522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19232845/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine norovirus genotype","bovine norovirus antibodies","distribution of bovine norovirus infections","related bovine noroviruses strains","norovirus amplicons","norovirus genomes","human noroviruses","Abstract Noroviruses","adult cattle","polymerase region","results of virus prevalence","RT-PCR","stool samples","seroprevalence studies","re-infection","diarrhoeic calves","Antibody levels","human beings","months of life","particles-based ELISA","specific immunity","year systematic study","animal species","Nucleotide sequencing","family Caliciviridae","basis","rotaviruses","rotavirus sequences","adults"],"language":"en"},

Dromedary camels are a likely source of infection and the virus probably originated in Africa. We studied the genetic diversity, geographical structure, infection prevalence, and age-associated prevalence among camels at the largest entry port of camels from Africa into the Arabian Peninsula. METHODS: In this prospective genomic study, we took nasal samples from camels imported from Sudan and Djibouti into the Port of Jeddah in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over an almost 2-year period and local Arabian camels over 2 months in the year after surveillance of the port. We determined the prevalence of MERS-CoV infection, age-associated patterns of infection, and undertook phylogeographical and migration analyses to determine intercountry virus transmission after local lineage establishment. We compared all virological characteristics between the local and imported cohorts. We compared major gene deletions between African and Arabian strains of the virus. Reproductive numbers were inferred with Bayesian birth death skyline analyses. FINDINGS: Between Aug 10, 2016, and May 3, 2018, we collected samples from 1196 imported camels, of which 868 originated from Sudan and 328 from Djibouti, and between May 1, and June 25, 2018, we collected samples from 472 local camels, of which 189 were from Riyadh and 283 were from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Virus prevalence was higher in local camels than in imported camels (224 [47\u00B75%] of 472 vs 157 [13\u00B71%] of 1196; p\u003C0\u00B70001). Infection prevalence peaked among camels older than 1 year and aged up to 2 years in both groups, with 255 (66\u00B79%) of 381 positive cases in this age group. Although the overall geographical distribution of the virus corresponded with the phylogenetic tree topology, some virus exchange was observed between countries corresponding with trade routes in the region. East and west African strains of the virus appear to be geographically separated, with an origin of west African strains in east Africa. African strains of the virus were not re-sampled in Saudi Arabia despite sampling approximately 1 year after importation from Africa. All local Arabian samples contained strains of the virus that belong to a novel recombinant clade (NRC) first detected in 2014 in Saudi Arabia. Reproduction number estimates informed by the sequences suggest sustained endemicity of NRC, with a mean R(e) of 1\u00B716. INTERPRETATION: Despite frequent imports of MERS-CoV with camels from Africa, African lineages of MERS-CoV do not establish themselves in Saudi Arabia. Arabian strains of the virus should be tested for changes in virulence and transmissibility.

Innate immune defenses exhibit neither antigen specificity nor memory, but they provide a critical line of first defense against viral infections because they are constantly present and are operational immediately after viral infection. Innate immunity is often considered separate from acquired immune responses, but they are inextricably linked, and innate responses modulate subsequent acquired responses in many ways. Viruses that are transmitted horizontally between individuals must first breach the barriers at their portal of entry before they can cause infection in their respective hosts. In the ongoing war and d\u00E9tente between virus and host, viruses have developed remarkably sophisticated mechanisms to avoid the various host protective responses. Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing viral diseases. There are some important differences between vaccination practices in humans and animals. The immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines, especially that of purified protein vaccines and synthetic peptides, usually needs to be enhanced; this may be achieved by mixing the antigen with an adjuvant, incorporation of the antigen in liposomes, or incorporation of the antigen in an immunostimulating complex.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Fenner\u0027s Veterinary Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123751584000043; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751584000043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune responses","innate responses","antigen specificity","Innate immunity","Innate immune defenses","subsequent acquired responses","various host protective responses","incorporation","viral infections","viral diseases","animals","different individuals","Viruses","vaccination practices","antiviral immunity","humoral factors","purified protein vaccines","immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines","environmental influences","chapter","humans","sophisticated mechanisms","d\u00E9tente","individual\u0027s genetic constitution","important differences","synthetic peptides","critical line","memory","effective way","nature","liposomes","Publisher Summary","ongoing war","barriers","course","ways","adjuvant","portal of entry","immunostimulating complex","respective hosts","pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we screened a library of compounds that are biologically active and structurally diverse for inhibitory activity against influenza neuraminidase (NA). We found that aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) is a potent inhibitor of NA activity of both group-1 and group-2 influenza viruses with IC50s (effective concentration to inhibit NA activity by 50%) values at low micromolar concentrations. ATA was equally potent in inhibiting the NA activity derived from wild-type NA and its H274Y mutant which renders NA resistance to inhibition by oseltamivir. Although ATA is structurally distinct from sialic acid, molecular modeling experiments suggested that ATA binds to NA at the enzyme\u2019s substrate binding site. These results indicate that ATA may be a good starting material for the design of a novel class of NA inhibitors for the treatment influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Hui-Chen; Tseng, Ching-Ping; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Ju, Yi-Wei; Tseng, Sung-Nain; Chen, Yen-Fu; Chao, Yu-Sheng; Hsieh, Hsing-Pang; Shih, Shin-Ru; Hsu, John T.-A.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7020b3b0ef1ba1aa192d2474f6baa2bed9514a9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114187.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.10.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208004300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014974/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208004300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA","ATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NA resistance","potent inhibitor of NA activity","wild-type NA","influenza neuraminidase","ATA binds","novel class of NA inhibitors","treatment influenza viruses","inhibitory activity","future influenza pandemics","pathogenic avian influenza virus","group","sialic acid","aurintricarboxylic acid","molecular modeling experiments","design","H274Y mutant","IC50s","effective concentration","values","enzyme\u2019s substrate binding site","continuing threat","good starting material","inhibition","low micromolar concentrations","oseltamivir","library of compounds","Abstract","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Both families are included in the Nidovirales order. Recently, a new group of invertebrate viruses, the Roniviridae, with a genetic structure and replication strategy similar to those of coronaviruses, has been described. This new virus family has been included within the Nidovirales. Coronaviruses have several advantages as vectors over other viral expression systems: (1) coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate within the cytoplasm without a DNA intermediary, making integration of the virus genome into the host cell chromosome unlikely, (2) these viruses have the largest RNA virus genome and, in principle, have room for the insertion of large foreign genes, (3) a pleiotropic secretory immune response is best induced by the stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissues, (4) the tropism of coronaviruses may be modified by manipulation of the spike (S) protein allowing engineering of the tropism of the vector, (5) non-pathogenic coronavirus strains infecting most species of interest (human, porcine, bovine, canine, feline, and avian) are available to develop expression systems, and (6) infectious coronavirus cDNA clones are available to design expression systems. Within the coronavirus two types of expression vectors have been developed: one requires two components (helper\u2013dependent expression system) and the other a single genome that is modified either by targeted recombination or by engineering a cDNA encoding an infectious RNA. This chapter focuses on the advantages and limitations of these coronavirus expression systems, the attempts to increase their expression levels by studying the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), and the proven possibility of modifying their tissue and species-specificity.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enjuanes, Luis; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; Ortego, Javier","journal":"New Comprehensive Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc0b4e76a1dc550b3c147ce8cc92516b6364a8fa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016773060338010X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016773060338010X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus expression systems","design expression systems","expression levels","viral expression systems","types of expression vectors","dependent expression system","tropism of coronaviruses","new virus family","infectious coronavirus cDNA clones","largest RNA virus genome","single genome","infectious RNA","non-pathogenic coronavirus strains","single-stranded RNA viruses","advantages","engineering","Coronaviridae family","Arteriviridae family","new group of invertebrate viruses","species-specificity","Nidovirales order","torovirus genera","canine","genetic structure","feline","Roniviridae","replication strategy similar","host cell chromosome unlikely","principle","limitations","attempts","insertion of large foreign genes","TRSs","room","bovine","spike","human","protein","transcription","components","helper","integration","cytoplasm","pleiotropic secretory immune response","stimulation of gut","lymphoid tissues","proven possibility","DNA intermediary","Publisher Summary","manipulation","targeted recombination","sequences","families","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Once, mostly confined to the traditional Sanger sequencing based individual virus discovery, is now entirely replaced by high throughput sequencing (HTS) based virus metagenomics that can be used to characterize the nature and composition of entire viromes. To better harness the potential of HTS for study of viromes, sample preparation methodologies used different refinements to exclude amplification of non-viral components that can overshadow low-titer viruses. These virus-sequence enrichment approaches mostly focused on the sample preparation methods, like enzymatic digestion of non-viral nucleic acids and size exclusion of non-viral constituents by column filtration, ultrafiltration or density centrifugation. However, recently an approach of virus-sequence enrichment called virome-capture sequencing, focused on the amplification or HTS library preparation stage, was shown to increase the ability of virome characterization. This new approach has the potential to further transform the field of virus discovery and virome analysis, but its technical complexity and sequence-dependence warrants further improvements. In this review we have listed the different methods, their applications and evolution, for selective sequencing based virome analysis and also the major refinements needed to harness the full potential of HTS for virome analysis.","publish_time":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Arvind; Murthy, Satyapramod; Kapoor, Amit","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39af00ac926b7900d82807e795601d5936512a3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5819613.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216305986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583442/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216305986; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.06.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virome-capture sequencing","approach of virus","selective sequencing based virome analysis","field of virus discovery","virus-sequence enrichment","potential of HTS","virus metagenomics","individual virus discovery","sequencing technologies","ability of virome characterization","sample preparation methods","traditional Sanger sequencing","high throughput sequencing","amplification of non-viral components","HTS library preparation stage","sample preparation methodologies","different refinements","different methods","sequence-dependence","size exclusion of non-viral constituents","enzymatic digestion of non-viral nucleic acids","study of viromes","major refinements","better harness","new approach","composition of entire viromes","column filtration","evolution","ultrafiltration","applications","technical complexity","density centrifugation","low-titer viruses","nature","Recent advances","improvements","review"],"language":"en"},

The complex interplay between virus-encoded and host-specific pathogenicity regulators \u2013 and the relative contributions of each toward viral pathogenicity \u2013 is not well-understood. RESULTS: By analyzing a collection of lung samples from mice infected by A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; VN1203), we characterized a signature of transcripts and proteins associated with the kinetics of the host response. Using a new geometrical representation method and two criteria, we show that inoculation concentrations and four specific mutations in VN1203 mainly impact the magnitude and velocity of the host response kinetics, rather than specific sets of up- and down- regulated genes. We observed analogous kinetic effects using lung samples from mice infected with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), and we show that these effects correlate with morbidity and viral titer. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the importance of the kinetics of the host response to H5N1 pathogenesis and its relationship with clinical disease severity and virus replication. These kinetic properties imply that time-matched comparisons of \u2018omics profiles to viral infections give limited views to differentiate host-responses. Moreover, these results demonstrate that a fast activation of the host-response at the earliest time points post-infection is critical for protective mechanisms against fast replicating viruses.","publish_time":"2013-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tchitchek, Nicolas; Eisfeld, Amie J; Tisoncik-Go, Jennifer; Josset, Laurence; Gralinski, Lisa E; B\u00E9cavin, Christophe; Tilton, Susan C; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo; Ferris, Martin T; Totura, Allison L; Li, Chengjun; Neumann, Gabriele; Metz, Thomas O; Smith, Richard D; Waters, Katrina M; Baric, Ralph; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Katze, Michael G","journal":"BMC Syst Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebda8d8ac0eb08bf9bd1c3bc80610f72572d1a73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3750405.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-7-69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23895213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host response kinetics","host-responses","host-specific pathogenicity regulators","viral pathogenicity","viral infections","mice","specific mutations","viral titer","VN1203","specific sets","RESULTS","analogous kinetic effects","collection of lung samples","respiratory disease","Influenza infection","H5N1 pathogenesis","virus replication","fast activation","kinetic properties","earliest time points post-infection","time-matched comparisons","clinical disease severity","fast replicating viruses","protective mechanisms","omics profiles","relationship","limited views","criteria","relative contributions","magnitude","velocity","inoculation concentrations","new geometrical representation method","BACKGROUND","signature of transcripts","proteins","morbidity","Vietnam","importance","complex interplay","California","death","regulated genes","H1N1","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The cDNA-based reverse genetics system is a seminal method that enables direct manipulation of the viral genomic RNA, thereby generating recombinant viruses for molecular and genetic studies of both viral RNA elements and gene products in viral replication and pathogenesis. It also provides a valuable platform that allows the development of genetically defined vaccines and viral vectors for the delivery of foreign genes. For many positive-strand RNA viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), however, the cloned cDNAs are unstable, posing a major obstacle to the construction and propagation of the functional cDNA. Here, the present report describes the strategic considerations in creating and amplifying a genetically stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) using the following general experimental procedures: viral RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, cDNA subcloning and modification, assembly of a full-length cDNA, cDNA linearization, in vitro RNA synthesis, and virus recovery. This protocol provides a general methodology applicable to cloning full-length cDNA for a range of positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with a genome of \u003E10 kb in length, into a BAC vector, from which infectious RNAs can be transcribed in vitro with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase.","publish_time":"2015-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yun, Sang-Im; Song, Byung-Hak; Kim, Jin-Kyoung; Lee, Young-Min","journal":"J Vis Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bbbbc7190599b47616269323cfbd3659d9dc420.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4780872.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26780115/; https://doi.org/10.3791/53164","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length cDNA","cDNA synthesis","RNA synthesis","cDNA subcloning","cDNA linearization","functional cDNA","viral RNA isolation","viral RNA elements","viral genomic RNA","positive-strand RNA viruses","stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA","bacteriophage RNA polymerase","viral vectors","viral replication","recombinant viruses","rescue infectious virus","field of positive","range of positive","infectious RNAs","virus recovery","Japanese encephalitis virus","reverse genetics system","BAC vector","cloned cDNAs","general methodology applicable","following general experimental procedures","genetic studies","gene products","modification","bacterial artificial chromosome","seminal method","direct manipulation","assembly","development","construction","propagation","approach","genomes","major obstacle","defined vaccines","delivery of foreign genes","pathogenesis","present report","strategic considerations","polarity","protocol","cellular mRNA","valuable platform"],"language":"en"},

The immune activities of the central nervous system are profoundly affected by peripheral immune activities. Immune tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of the immune system to continuous or repeated stimulation to avoid excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury in the face of continuous antigen threat. It has been proved that the immune tolerance could suppress the development of various peripheral inflammation-related diseases. However, the role of immune tolerance in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases was not clear. METHODS: Rats were injected with repeated low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days to induce peripheral immune tolerance. Neuroinflammation was produced using intracranial LPS (15 \u03BCg) injection. Inflammation cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Microglial activation were measured using immunostaining of Iba-1 and ED-1. Dopaminergic neuronal damage was evaluated using immunochemistry staining and stereological counting of TH-positive neurons. Behavioral impairment was evaluated using amphetamine-induced rotational behavioral assessment. RESULTS: Compared with the non-immune tolerated animals, pre-treatment of peripheral immune tolerance significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, suppressed the microglial activation, and increased the number of dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra.

Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaimes, Javier A.; Andr\u00E9, Nicole M.; Millet, Jean K.; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad2b326221b48e904660968e5d10c4cb2882c5e0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7ab9f9fcea519ebce527c3ede8091beedbb26ad9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.942185","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","common receptor","SARS-related bat coronaviruses","receptor binding module","extended structural loop","nCoV spike glycoprotein","similar receptor utilization","structural modeling","fusion activation","basic amino acids","low amino acid similarity","China","entry properties","interface","line","S1","Hubei province","major public health concern","widespread outbreak","support","S2","data","virus stability","transmission","presence","domains","novel coronavirus","proteolytically-sensitive"],"language":"en"},

Increasing knowledge about the complex interplay of skin-associated cell types in the development of cutaneous immune responses has fueled efforts to target the skin for vaccination as well as for immunotherapy. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview on skin layers and their resident immunocompetent cell types. Advantages and shortcomings of standard methods and innovative technologies to circumvent the outermost skin barrier are addressed. Studies employing fractional skin ablation by infrared lasers for cutaneous delivery of drugs, as well as high molecular weight molecules such as protein antigens or antibodies, are reviewed, and laserporation is introduced as a versatile transcutaneous vaccination platform. Specific targeting of the epidermis or the dermis by different laser settings, the resulting kinetics of uptake and transport and the immune response types elicited are discussed, and the potential of this transcutaneous delivery platform for allergen-specific immunotherapy is demonstrated. EXPERT OPINION: Needle-free and painless vaccination approaches have the potential to replace standard methods due to their improved safety and optimal patient compliance. The use of fractional laser devices for stepwise ablation of skin layers might be advantageous for both vaccination against microbial pathogens, as well as immunotherapeutic approaches, such as allergen-specific immunotherapy. Thorough investigation of the underlying immunological mechanisms will help to provide the knowledge for a rational design of transcutaneous protective/therapeutic vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scheiblhofer, Sandra; Thalhamer, Josef; Weiss, Richard","journal":"Expert Opin Drug Deliv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17114faf3bbc2a82ef49762ce4f3f922cb213f4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3667678.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1517/17425247.2013.773970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23425032/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fractional skin ablation","stepwise ablation of skin layers","complex interplay of skin","outermost skin barrier","allergen-specific immunotherapy","versatile transcutaneous vaccination platform","transcutaneous delivery platform","painless vaccination approaches","associated cell types","immune response types","potential","knowledge","Specific targeting","resident immunocompetent cell types","cutaneous delivery of drugs","shortcomings of standard methods","use of fractional laser devices","rational design of transcutaneous protective","development of cutaneous immune responses","immunotherapeutic approaches","different laser settings","underlying immunological mechanisms","unique immunological properties","infrared lasers","innovative technologies","resulting kinetics of uptake","improved safety","transport","Needle-free","protein antigens","high molecular weight molecules","muscle","epidermis","efforts","therapeutic vaccines","subcutaneous tissue","microbial pathogens","contrast","antibodies","optimal patient compliance","Thorough investigation","review","overview","Studies","EXPERT OPINION","laserporation","Advantages","INTRODUCTION","AREAS"],"language":"en"},

However, relevant comprehensive estimates lack in China. Here, we measure the energy potential of China\u0027s domestic biomass resources (including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge) from 2000 to 2016 and draw the spatial-temporal variation trajectories at provincial resolution. Scenario analysis and life cycle assessment are also applied to discuss the greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. Results show that the collectable potential of domestic biomass resources increased from 18.31 EJ in 2000 to 22.67 EJ in 2016 with overall uncertainties fluctuating between (\u221226.6%, 39.7%) and (\u221227.6%, 39.5%). Taking energy crops into account, the total potential in 2016 (32.69 EJ) was equivalent to 27.6% of China\u0027s energy consumption. If this potential can be realized in a planned way to displace fossil fuels during the period 2020\u20132050, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation would be in the range of 1652.73\u20135859.56 Mt CO2-equivalent, in which the negative greenhouse gas emissions due to the introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would account for 923.78\u20131344.13 Mt CO2-equivalent. Contrary to increasing bioenergy potentials in most provinces, there are declining trends in Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhejiang. In addition, Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia would have the highest associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. This study can provide valuable guidance on the exploitation of China\u0027s untapped biomass resources for the mitigation of global climate change.","publish_time":"2020-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Yating; Yang, Qing; Bartocci, Pietro; Wei, Hongjian; Liu, Sylvia Shuhan; Wu, Zhujuan; Zhou, Hewen; Yang, Haiping; Fantozzi, Francesco; Chen, Hanping","journal":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/490b47171bc417f4bfc597c7a22b3212b15163e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120301362; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364032120301362","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing","Tibet","Shanghai","Zhejiang"],"keyphrases":["associated emissions mitigation","cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation","negative greenhouse gas emissions","assessment of biomass resources","energy potential of China\u0027s domestic biomass resources","highest associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials","collectable potential of domestic biomass resources","negative carbon emissions","bioenergy potentials","exploitation of China\u0027s untapped biomass resources","total potential","China\u0027s energy consumption","Mt CO2-equivalent","mitigation of global climate change","carbon capture","introduction of bioenergy","energy crops","account","low carbon future","crop residues","forest residues","life cycle assessment","animal manure","municipal solid waste","key step","Inner Mongolia","Tibet","Beijing","spatial-temporal variation trajectories","declining trends","provincial resolution","sewage sludge","valuable guidance","fossil fuels","Shanghai","Yunnan","Sichuan","Scenario analysis","period","provinces","range","planned way","relevant comprehensive estimates","Zhejiang","addition","storage","study","overall uncertainties","Abstract","Results"],"language":"en"},

Severe complications from ZIKV infection include neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome in adults and a variety of fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly, blindness, placental insufficiency, and fetal demise. There is an urgent need for tools and reagents to study the pathogenesis of epidemic ZIKV and for testing vaccines and antivirals. Using a reverse genetics platform, we generated six ZIKV infectious clones and derivative viruses representing diverse temporal and geographic origins. These include three versions of MR766, the prototype 1947 strain (with and without a glycosylation site in the envelope protein), and H/PF/2013, a 2013 human isolate from French Polynesia representative of the virus introduced to Brazil. In the course of synthesizing a clone of a circulating Brazilian strain, phylogenetic studies identified two distinct ZIKV clades in Brazil. We reconstructed viable clones of strains SPH2015 and BeH819015, representing ancestral members of each clade. We assessed recombinant virus replication, binding to monoclonal antibodies, and virulence in mice.

Since the end of February, Europe has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but there are major country differences in both the spread of the virus and measures taken to stop the virus. Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated the importance of societal and social psychological factors in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. By considering multiple perspectives, this study showed that country differences in Europe are major, and this will have an impact on how countries will cope with the ongoing crisis in the following months. The results indicated the importance of timely restrictions and cooperation with people.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oksanen, Atte; Kaakinen, Markus; Latikka, Rita; Savolainen, Iina; Savela, Nina; Koivula, Aki","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184967.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["higher COVID","lower COVID","daily COVID","country variations of COVID","spread","institutional trust","epidemic","major country differences","Major differences","Social psychological factors","social risk factors","European countries","impact of social relations","later mortality figures","significant differences","background analysis of European Social Survey data","importance of timely restrictions","present study","ongoing crisis","RESULTS","importance of societal","control measures","coronavirus disease","Late reaction","reaction times","Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models","days","cooperation","outbreak","Perceived sociability","analyses","following months","people","findings","multiple perspectives","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE","aim","METHODS","development","end","societies"],"language":"en"},

We also compare vaccine effectiveness against ILI versus laboratory-confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) influenza, and assess the possible bias caused by using non-specific endpoints and observational data. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We estimated vaccine effectiveness by using the following formula: VE = (PPV-PCV)/(PPV(1-PCV)) \u00D7 100%, where PPV is the proportion vaccinated in the population and PCV the proportion of vaccinated influenza cases. People were considered vaccinated three weeks after receiving a dose of vaccine. ILI and pandemic A(H1N1) laboratory-confirmed cases were obtained from two surveillance networks of general practitioners. During the epidemic, 99.7% of influenza isolates were pandemic A(H1N1). Pandemic and seasonal vaccine uptakes in the population were obtained from the National Health Insurance database and by telephonic surveys, respectively. Effectiveness estimates were adjusted by age and week. The presence of residual biases was explored by calculating vaccine effectiveness after the influenza period. The effectiveness of pandemic vaccines in preventing ILI was 52% (95% confidence interval: 30\u201369) during the pandemic and 33% (4\u201355) after. It was 86% (56\u201398) against confirmed influenza. The effectiveness of seasonal vaccines against ILI was 61% (56\u201366) during the pandemic and 19% (\u221210\u201341) after. It was 60% (41\u201374) against confirmed influenza. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of pandemic vaccines in preventing confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) influenza on the field was high, consistently with published findings. It was significantly lower against ILI. This is unsurprising since not all ILI cases are caused by influenza. Trivalent 2009-2010 seasonal vaccines had a statistically significant effectiveness in preventing ILI and confirmed pandemic influenza, but were not better in preventing confirmed pandemic influenza than in preventing ILI. This lack of difference might be indicative of selection bias.","publish_time":"2011-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pelat, Camille; Falchi, Alessandra; Carrat, Fabrice; Mosnier, Anne; Bonmarin, Isabelle; Turbelin, Cl\u00E9ment; Vaux, Sophie; van der Werf, Sylvie; Cohen, Jean Marie; Lina, Bruno; Blanchon, Thierry; Hanslik, Thomas","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9580bfcbdb77b78a21887a8911bb9b69444182a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3091864.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21573005/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","PPV","National Health Insurance"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["confirmed pandemic influenza","confirmed influenza","effectiveness of pandemic vaccines","effective pandemic","vaccine effectiveness","influenza isolates","influenza period","ILI cases","effectiveness of seasonal vaccines","H1N1","proportion of vaccinated influenza cases","significant effectiveness","Effectiveness estimates","seasonal vaccine uptakes","dose of vaccine","PPV-PCV","population","laboratory","possible bias","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","published findings","indicative of selection bias","National Health Insurance database","non-specific endpoints","following formula","telephonic surveys","weeks","field","surveillance networks of general practitioners","observational data","lack of difference","presence of residual biases","age","study","CONCLUSIONS","METHODOLOGY","People","epidemic","France","illness","confidence interval","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Internet users frequently search for health information online, although the accuracy of the information retrieved varies greatly and can be misleading. Newspapers have the potential to influence public health behaviours, but information has been lacking in relation to how newspapers portray online health information to their readers. METHODS: The newspaper database Nexis(\u00AE)UK was searched for articles published from 2003 \u2013 2012 relating to online health information. Systematic content analysis of articles published in the highest circulation newspapers in the UK and US was performed. A second researcher coded a 10% sample to establish inter-rater reliability of coding. RESULTS: In total, 161 newspaper articles were included in the analysis. Publication was most frequent in 2003, 2008 and 2009, which coincided with global threats to public health. UK broadsheet newspapers were significantly more likely to cover online health information than UK tabloid newspapers (p = 0.04) and only one article was identified in US tabloid newspapers. Articles most frequently appeared in health sections. Among the 79 articles that linked online health information to specific diseases or health topics, diabetes was the most frequently mentioned disease, cancer the commonest group of diseases and sexual health the most frequent health topic. Articles portrayed benefits of obtaining online health information more frequently than risks. Quotations from health professionals portrayed mixed opinions regarding public access to online health information. 108 (67.1%) articles directed readers to specific health-related web sites. 135 (83.9%) articles were rated as having balanced judgement and 76 (47.2%) were judged as having excellent quality reporting. No difference was found in the quality of reporting between UK and US articles. CONCLUSIONS: Newspaper coverage of online health information was low during the 10-year period 2003 to 2012. Journalists tended to emphasise the benefits and understate the risks of online health information and the quality of reporting varied considerably. Newspapers directed readers to sources of online health information during global epidemics although, as most articles appeared in the health sections of broadsheet newspapers, coverage was limited to a relatively small readership.

Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19. Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Ping; Duan, Fang; Luo, Chunhua; Liu, Qiang; Qu, Xingguang; Liang, Liang; Wu, Kaili","journal":"JAMA Ophthalmology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232433/; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/articlepdf/2764083/jamaophthalmology_wu_2020_br_200003.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.1291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ocular manifestations of patients","ocular symptoms","SARS-CoV","ocular abnormalities","ocular signs","conjunctiva of patients","included patients","ocular manifestations consistent","RT-PCR","severe COVID","positive results","nasopharyngeal swabs","confirmed COVID","conjunctival swabs","results of blood tests","low prevalence of SARS","positive findings","nasopharyngeal specimens","conjunctival hyperemia","China","higher white blood cell","outbreak of coronavirus disease","viral prevalence","higher levels of procalcitonin","association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","neutrophil counts","reverse transcriptase","polymerase chain reaction","lactate dehydrogenase","C-reactive protein","chemosis","conjunctivitis","epiphora","MEASURES","PARTICIPANTS","hospital center","Hubei province","MAIN OUTCOMES","case series","univariate analysis","period of treatment","age","mean","SD","diagnosis","increased secretions","prevention of transmission","reports","study","tears","ophthalmologists","CONCLUSIONS","RELEVANCE","male","DESIGN","SETTING","infected individuals","IMPORTANCE","OBJECTIVE","eyes","years","total","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of selected potential cases were assessed through serum blood specimens, medical record reviews, and interviews with surviving outbreak members, household contacts, and healthcare personnel. Cases of MERS-CoV infection were identified using 3 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention serologic tests for detection of anti\u2013MERS-CoV antibodies. RESULTS: Specimens and interviews were obtained from 124 subjects. Seven previously unconfirmed individuals tested positive for anti\u2013MERS-CoV antibodies by at least 2 of 3 serologic tests, in addition to 2 fatal cases identified by rRT-PCR. The case-fatality rate among the 9 total cases was 22%. Six subjects were healthcare workers at the outbreak hospital, yielding an attack rate of 10% among potentially exposed outbreak hospital personnel. There was no evidence of MERS-CoV transmission at 2 transfer hospitals having acceptable infection control practices. CONCLUSIONS: Novel serologic tests allowed for the detection of otherwise unrecognized cases of MERS-CoV infection among contacts in a Jordanian hospital-associated respiratory illness outbreak in April 2012, resulting in a total of 9 test-positive cases. Serologic results suggest that further spread of this outbreak to transfer hospitals did not occur. Most subjects had no major, underlying medical conditions; none were on hemodialysis. Our observed case-fatality rate was lower than has been reported from outbreaks elsewhere.","publish_time":"2014-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Abdallat, Mohammad Mousa; Payne, Daniel C.; Alqasrawi, Sultan; Rha, Brian; Tohme, Rania A.; Abedi, Glen R.; Nsour, Mohannad Al; Iblan, Ibrahim; Jarour, Najwa; Farag, Noha H.; Haddadin, Aktham; Al-Sanouri, Tarek; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L.; Kuhar, David T.; Swerdlow, David L.; Erdman, Dean D.; Pallansch, Mark A.; Haynes, Lia M.; Gerber, Susan I.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41582f5e4832366dd7d0dbe76e319a622c6981f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4834865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829216/; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/59/9/1225/17853095/ciu359.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciu359","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Jordan Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Jordan"],"keyphrases":["unrecognized cases of MERS","fatal cases","total cases","MERS-CoV antibodies","CoV infection","test-positive cases","CoV transmission","evidence of MERS","respiratory illness outbreak","exposed outbreak hospital personnel","outbreak of lower respiratory illnesses","Serologic results","subjects","surviving outbreak members","Prevention serologic tests","Novel serologic tests","Jordanian hospital","detected cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome","clinical characteristics of selected potential cases","detection of anti","interviews","rRT-PCR","transfer hospitals","observed case-fatality rate","attack rate","healthcare personnel","acceptable infection control practices","Disease Control","household contacts","medical conditions","healthcare workers","medical record reviews","serum blood specimens","Jordan Ministry of Health","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","US Centers","spread","addition","unconfirmed individuals","METHODS","major","CONCLUSIONS","hemodialysis","outbreaks","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we focused on interactions between S. aureus and non-influenza viruses.

In children, respiratory syncytial virus infection is associated with S. aureus carriage. The mechanisms by which some non-influenza respiratory viruses predispose host cells to S. aureus superinfection can be summarized in three categories: i) modifying expression levels of cellular patterns involved in S. aureus adhesion and/or internalization, ii) inducing S. aureus invasion of epithelial cells due to the disruption of tight junctions, and iii) decreasing S. aureus clearance by altering the immune response. The comprehension of pathways involved in S. aureus-respiratory virus interactions may help developing new strategies of preventive and curative therapy.","publish_time":"2018-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morgene, M.

The present study aimed to identify reference genes as internal controls for gene expression studies by RT-qPCR in azole-stimulated Candida glabrata. RESULTS: The expression stability of 16 reference genes under fluconazole stress was evaluated using fold change and standard deviation computations with the hkgFinder tool. Our data revealed that the mRNA expression levels of three ribosomal RNAs (RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25) remained stable in response to fluconazole, while PGK1, UBC7, and UBC13 mRNAs showed only approximately 2.9-, 3.0-, and 2.5-fold induction by azole, respectively. By contrast, mRNA levels of the other 10 reference genes (ACT1, EF1\u03B1, GAPDH, PPIA, RPL2A, RPL10, RPL13A, SDHA, TUB1, and UBC4) were dramatically increased in C. glabrata following antifungal treatment, exhibiting changes ranging from 4.5- to 32.7-fold. We also assessed the expression stability of these reference genes using the 2(-\u0394\u0394CT) method and three other software packages. The stability rankings of the reference genes by geNorm and the 2(-\u0394\u0394CT) method were identical to those by hkgFinder, whereas the stability rankings by BestKeeper and NormFinder were notably different. We then validated the suitability of six candidate reference genes (ACT1, PGK1, RDN5.8, RDN18, UBC7, and UBC13) as internal controls for ten target genes in this system using the comparative C(T) method. Our validation experiments passed for all six reference genes analyzed except RDN18, where the amplification efficiency of RDN18 was different from that of the ten target genes. Finally, we demonstrated that the relative quantification of target gene expression varied according to the endogenous control used, highlighting the importance of the choice of internal controls in such experiments. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of RDN5.8, UBC13, and PGK1 alone or the combination of RDN5.8 plus UBC13 or PGK1 as reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in C. glabrata following azole treatment. In contrast, we show that ACT1 and other commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, PPIA, RPL13A, TUB1, etc.) were not validated as good internal controls in the current model.","publish_time":"2012-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Qingdi Quentin; Skinner, Jeff; Bennett, John E","journal":"BMC Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69d2e69e949dab8909be8c7b764a0d5469546b31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3482582.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2199-13-22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22747760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["used reference genes","suitable reference genes","candidate reference genes","target genes","expression stability","gene expression studies","PGK1","RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression","mRNA expression levels","reliable gene expression analysis","relative quantification of target gene expression","good internal controls","choice of internal controls","ACT1","stability rankings","method","azole treatment","use of RDN5","combination of RDN5","UBC13 mRNAs","PPIA","GAPDH","RPL13A","mRNA levels","azole-stimulated Candida glabrata","UBC7","amplification efficiency of RDN18","fold change","TUB1","\u0394\u0394CT","fold induction","contrast","different experimental conditions","selection of stable","fluconazole stress","hkgFinder tool","antifungal treatment","validation experiments","real-time quantitative PCR","crucial prerequisite","standard deviation computations","RPL2A","RPL10","EF1\u03B1","ribosomal RNAs","SDHA","importance","system","comparative C","current model","response","BestKeeper","NormFinder","geNorm","endogenous control","changes","RDN25","data","present study","suitability","software packages","UBC4","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Public transportation is not only a bridge through which infections travel from one location to another but also a place where infections occur since individuals are typically in close proximity to each other due to the limited space in these systems. A mathematical model is constructed to study the spread of an infectious disease through such systems. A variant of the next generation method is proposed and used to provide upper and lower bounds of the basic reproduction number for the model. Our investigation indicates that increasing transportation efficiency, and improving sanitation and ventilation of the public transportation system decrease the chance of an outbreak occurring. Moreover, discouraging unnecessary travel during an epidemic also decreases the chance of an outbreak. However, reducing travel by infectives while allowing susceptibles to travel may not be enough to avoid an outbreak.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Fei; Connell McCluskey, C.; Cressman, Ross","journal":"Mathematical Biosciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43758fa3b37840df736bcb6510d4be65364ae4e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094585.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556413002162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018293/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2013.08.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556413002162","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreak","public transportation system","unnecessary travel","increasing transportation efficiency","chance","locations","systems","infections","epidemic spreading","mathematical model","sanitation","basic reproduction number","lower bounds","ventilation","individuals","place","infectious disease","investigation","infectives","susceptibles","bridge","hub","close proximity","limited space","variant","generation method","article"],"language":"en"},

Although primary isolation of HMPV has been achieved in several different cell lines, the low level of virus replication and the subsequent recovery of low levels of infectious HMPV have hampered biochemical studies on the virus. These experimental methodologies usually require higher levels of biological material that can be achieved following HMPV infection. In this study we demonstrate that expression of the HMPV F, G and M proteins in mammalian cells leads to HMPV virus-like particles (VLP) formation. This experimental strategy will serve as a model system to allow the process of HMPV virus assembly to be examined. METHODS: The HMPV F, G and M proteins were expressed in mammalian cell lines. Protein cross-linking studies, sucrose gradient centrifugation and in situ imaging was used to examine interactions between the virus proteins. VLP formation was examined using sucrose density gradient centrifugation and electron microscopy analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of cells co-expressing the F, G and M proteins demonstrated that these proteins interacted. Furthermore, in cells co-expression the three HMPV proteins the formation VLPs was observed. Image analysis revealed the VLPs had a similar morphology to the filamentous virus morphology that we observed on HMPV-infected cells. The capacity of each protein to initiate VLP formation was examined using a VLP formation assay. Individual expression of each virus protein showed that the G protein was able to form VLPs in the absence of the other virus proteins. Furthermore, co-expression of the G protein with either the M or F proteins facilitated their incorporation into the VLP fraction. CONCLUSION: Co-expression of the F, G and M proteins leads to the formation of VLPs, and that incorporation of the F and M proteins into VLPs is facilitated by their interaction with the G protein. Our data suggests that the G protein plays a central role in VLP formation, and further suggests that the G protein may also play a role in the recruitment of the F and M proteins to sites of virus particle formation during HMPV infection.","publish_time":"2013-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loo, Liat Hui; Jumat, Muhammad Raihan; Fu, Yi; Ayi, Teck Choon; Wong, Pui San; Tee, Nancy WS; Tan, Boon Huan; Sugrue, Richard J","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adbb0a486cf43c474df8b8b86fa6eacd422b171c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3849350.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24067107/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","HMPV F"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMPV proteins","virus proteins","HMPV F","F proteins","G protein","formation VLPs","formation of VLPs","process of HMPV virus assembly","HMPV-infected cells","following HMPV infection","VLP formation assay","sites of virus particle formation","primary isolation of HMPV","cells co-expression","filamentous virus morphology","Protein cross-linking studies","Analysis of cells co-","VLP fraction","low level of virus replication","subsequent recovery of low levels of infectious HMPV","mammalian cells","Individual expression","sucrose gradient centrifugation","incorporation","mammalian cell lines","Image analysis","sucrose density gradient centrifugation","electron microscopy analysis","different cell lines","similar morphology","biochemical studies","central role","experimental methodologies","experimental strategy","major cause of lower respiratory infection","higher levels of biological material","situ imaging","children","model system","interactions","absence","particles","BACKGROUND","Human metapneumovirus","RESULTS","recruitment","CONCLUSION","METHODS","capacity","data","study"],"language":"en"},

The capture ELISAs showed higher sensitivity than indirect ELISAs for detection of BCV-specific IgA and IgM. In the capture ELISAs the agreement between detection in milk and serum samples was 94% for IgA and 86% for IgM. The correlation between log10 titres in milk and serum was r=0.82 (P\u003C0.001) for IgA and 0.84 (P\u003C0.001) for IgM. Milk seemed a better target than serum for diagnosing specific IgA at low levels. There was no variation in the isotype-specific BCV antibody titres between healthy quarters of the same udder, but subclinical mastitis was associated with higher levels of IgA antibodies and weak false IgM positive reactions in undiluted milk. Bovine IgA and IgM antibodies in milk and serum showed high stability towards freezing and thawing and storage at room temperature. The antibody responses to BCV were followed in milk and serum from six dairy cows and in serum from four calves for a period of 1 year after an outbreak of winter dysentery (WD). In this outbreak some animals became reinfected with BCV. The IgA and IgM capture ELISAs differentiated between primarily BCV infected and reinfected animals. In the primarily infected cattle, IgM antibodies were first detected in milk and serum four to nine days after the first WD symptoms observed, and were subsequently detected for at least 2\u20133 weeks. IgM was also detected in the reinfected cows, but mostly at lower levels and for a shorter period of time than in the primarily infected animals. In milk, however, the IgM response of the reinfected cows was detected for a longer period of time than in serum. Six months after the outbreak, IgA was still detected in both serum and milk of all six cows and also in serum of one calf. The reinfected cows showed higher and more long-lasting peak levels of IgA in milk and serum than the primarily infected cows, indicating boosting of the IgA response.","publish_time":"2000-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00E4slund, K.; Tr\u00E5v\u00E9n, M.; Larsson, B.; Silv\u00E1n, A.; Linde, N.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03572caf405000a55d681cfcdff1391a520a9c6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117479.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113599002084; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113599002084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCV-specific IgA","serum samples","IgM antibodies","IgA response","IgM capture ELISAs","undiluted milk","Bovine IgA","IgM response","reinfected cows","higher levels of IgA antibodies","BCV infected","long-lasting peak levels of IgA","detection of BCV","reinfected animals","dairy cows","isotype-specific BCV antibody titres","indirect ELISAs","Abstract Isotype-capture ELISAs","infected cattle","weak false IgM positive reactions","lower levels","low levels","higher sensitivity","longer period of time","shorter period of time","outbreak of winter dysentery","log10 titres","antibody responses","Swedish cattle","WD symptoms","healthy quarters","year","agreement","better target","udder","subclinical mastitis","high stability","days","calves","storage","correlation","variation","room temperature","months","calf","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Thus far, a variety of protein disorder prediction methods have been developed and have been widely used, not only in traditional bioinformatics domains, including protein structure prediction, protein structure determination and function annotation, but also in many other biomedical fields. The relationship between intrinsically-disordered proteins and some human diseases has played a significant role in disorder prediction in disease identification and epidemiological investigations. Disordered proteins can also serve as potential targets for drug discovery with an emphasis on the disordered-to-ordered transition in the disordered binding regions, and this has led to substantial research in drug discovery or design based on protein disordered region prediction. Furthermore, protein disorder prediction has also been applied to healthcare by predicting the disease risk of mutations in patients and studying the mechanistic basis of diseases. As the applications of disorder prediction increase, so too does the need to make quick and accurate predictions. To fill this need, we also present a new approach to predict protein residue disorder using wide sequence windows that is applicable on the genomic scale.","publish_time":"2015-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xin; Gumm, Jordan; Karki, Suman; Eickholt, Jesse; Cheng, Jianlin","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d37ad55db18a412c55ca07e3780ab65ec8040908.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4519904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26198229/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms160715384","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein structure prediction","Protein disordered regions","protein disordered region prediction","protein residue disorder","protein chain","variety of protein disorder prediction methods","protein structure determination","disordered proteins","applications of disorder prediction increase","disordered binding regions","drug discovery","stable structure","need","disease identification","human diseases","disease risk of mutations","mechanistic basis of diseases","design","significant role","wide sequence windows","patients","potential targets","segments","traditional bioinformatics domains","epidemiological investigations","new approach","function annotation","substantial research","emphasis","transition","accurate predictions","healthcare","genomic scale","relationship","biomedical fields"],"language":"en"},

Proof of concept for targeting functional RNA by small molecule inhibitors has been demonstrated for multiple viruses with RNA genomes. Strategies to identify antiviral compounds as inhibitors of ncRNA are increasingly emphasizing consideration of drug\u2010like properties of candidate molecules emerging from screening and ligand design. Recent efforts of antiviral lead discovery for RNA targets have provided drug\u2010like small molecules that inhibit viral replication and include inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), and influenza A virus. While target selectivity remains a challenge for the discovery of useful RNA\u2010binding compounds, a better understanding is emerging of properties that define RNA targets amenable for inhibition by small molecule ligands. Insight from successful approaches of targeting viral ncRNA in HIV, HCV, SARS CoV, and influenza A will provide a basis for the future exploration of RNA targets for therapeutic intervention in other viral pathogens which create urgent, unmet medical needs.

However, there currently exists no systematic mapping between cell types and the diseases they can cause. METHODS: In this study, we integrate protein\u2013protein interaction data with high-quality cell-type-specific gene expression data from the FANTOM5 project to build the largest collection of cell-type-specific interactomes created to date. We develop a novel method, called gene set compactness (GSC), that contrasts the relative positions of disease-associated genes across 73 cell-type-specific interactomes to map genes associated with 196 diseases to the cell types they affect. We conduct text-mining of the PubMed database to produce an independent resource of disease-associated cell types, which we use to validate our method. RESULTS: The GSC method successfully identifies known disease\u2013cell-type associations, as well as highlighting associations that warrant further study. This includes mast cells and multiple sclerosis, a cell population currently being targeted in a multiple sclerosis phase 2 clinical trial. Furthermore, we build a cell-type-based diseasome using the cell types identified as manifesting each disease, offering insight into diseases linked through etiology. CONCLUSIONS: The data set produced in this study represents the first large-scale mapping of diseases to the cell types in which they are manifested and will therefore be useful in the study of disease systems. Overall, we demonstrate that our approach links disease-associated genes to the phenotypes they produce, a key goal within systems medicine.

The well-established quarantine measures for nonhuman primates and those that have re-emerged for rodents are very important. The increased use and exchange of genetically engineered mutant mice especially demands rodent quarantine capabilities for the majority of research institutions.

Animals obtained from commercial vendors, as opposed to other research institutions, may be less likely to harbor undesirable microorganisms, often allowing them to be exempt from a quarantine program. The ideal quarantine facility should be flexible enough to allow the use of multiple species, and take into account the number and frequency of shipments expected. The more shipments and different species involved, the more subdivided the facility should be, through the use of multiple rooms, cubicles, isolators, etc. At a minimum, ABSL2 design criteria should be used to enable the containment of pathogens at the room or cage level, while also preventing agent transmission via contaminated animal waste, fomites, and personnel.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huerkamp, Michael J.; Pullium, Jennifer K.","journal":"Planning and Designing Research Animal Facilities","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e63dc754b42b7af6596c586e9665bb77fae944fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173547.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123695178000268; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123695178000268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quarantine requirements","quarantine program","ideal quarantine facility","rodent quarantine capabilities","well-established quarantine measures","use of multiple species","animal health","animal facilities","use of multiple rooms","increased use","contaminated animal waste","majority of research institutions","agent transmission","route of transmission","different species","containment of pathogens","frequency of shipments","species-specific housing requirements","engineered mutant mice","exchange","degree of hazard","fomites","account","chapter","cage level","minimum","isolators","nonhuman primates","cubicles","Publisher Summary","ABSL2 design criteria","number","personnel","terms","commercial vendors","Animals","undesirable microorganisms","rodents"],"language":"en"},

More research is urgently needed to explore the biological plausibility and safety of herbal medicines to manage AMR. AMR is universal, affecting anyone and everyone, at any age and in any country. Investigating how such approaches can be integrated into western medicine will be important to elucidate.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Xiao-Yang; Logue, Martin; Robinson, Nicola","journal":"Eur J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8749f6f5db7de619c46e573ca93be70634684fca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217106.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382019314477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399092/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382019314477?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","AMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current antimicrobial medicines","safety of herbal medicines","current antimicrobial approaches","challenges AMR poses","antimicrobial resistance","western medicine","slow development of new medicines","UK strategies","UK government","solutions","Chinese national guidelines","policies","agriculture","pharmaceutical industry investment","common infections","useful modality","antibiotics","outbreak","major issue","biological plausibility","international bodies","global public health crisis","fight","COVID","tandem","situation","reliance","antimicrobials","guidance","Recommendations","age","country","research"],"language":"en"},

In acute viral infections, the infection of oligodendroglial cells, leading to cell destruction, may be the main mechanism for inducing this neuropathological lesion. In the case of a persistent virus infection in oligodendroglia cells, however, it is conceivable that functional impairment of oligodendroglia cells, or the induction of an immune reaction to the agent that may cross-react with brain antigens, could eventually cause demyelination. Therefore, pathogenic studies on subacute or chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitides in association with viral infections may provide information on the mechanisms involved in demyelination. In rats, depending on the biological property of the virus material used, the genetic background and immune response of the host, a subacute or late demyelinating encephalomyelitis can be induced, accompanied by primary demyelination. This provides a model for analysis of the virus and host factors interacting in the pathogenesis of these diseases.","publish_time":"1983-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wege, Helmut; Watanabe, Rihito; Koga, Makoto; Meulen, Volker Ter","journal":"Progress in Brain Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/badcffd1f87e058a024bf1c50b791d6e17f5eed2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079612308638674; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308638674","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary demyelination","infection of oligodendroglial cells","persistent virus infection","virus material","acute viral infections","immune reaction","functional impairment of oligodendroglia cells","host factors","immune response","immunopathological reaction","chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitides","late demyelinating encephalomyelitis","association","central nervous system","genetic background","Publisher Summary Disease processes","information","main mechanism","cell destruction","pathogenic studies","biological property","CNS","analysis","consequence","induction","neuropathological lesion","pathogenesis","mechanisms","case","result","rats","model","brain antigens","agent","diseases"],"language":"en"},

The finding that CHV is genetically the virus most closely related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) has raised the question of whether HCV might have evolved as the result of close contact between dogs and/or horses and humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the NS3/4A serine protease of CHV specifically cleaves human mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta (TRIF). The proteolytic activity of CHV NS3/4A was evaluated using a bacteriophage lambda genetic screen. Human MAVS- and TRIF-specific cleavage sites were engineered into the lambda cI repressor. Upon infection of Escherichia coli cells coexpressing these repressors and a CHV NS3/4A construct, lambda phage replicated up to 2000-fold more efficiently than in cells expressing a CHV protease variant carrying the inactivating substitution S139A. Comparable results were obtained when several HCV NS3/4A constructs of genotype 1b were assayed. This indicates that CHV can disrupt the human innate antiviral defense signaling pathway and suggests a possible evolutionary relationship between CHV and HCV.","publish_time":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parera, Mariona; Martrus, Gloria; Franco, Sandra; Clotet, Bonaventura; Martinez, Miguel Angel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d75571144654e55a962409ab789839f59f7e772d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3411667.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22870331/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0042481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Canine"],"organizations":["CHV","HCV","Escherichia"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV NS3","CHV protease variant","serine protease of CHV","proteolytic activity of CHV NS3","Human MAVS","human mitochondrial antiviral","lambda phage","horses","human innate antiviral defense","lambda cI repressor","domestic dogs","bacteriophage lambda genetic screen","hepatitis C virus","TRIF-specific cleavage sites","infection of Escherichia coli cells","pathway","possible evolutionary relationship","receptor domain","adaptor","protein","repressors","inactivating substitution S139A","Toll-IL","interferon-beta","result of close contact","constructs of genotype","Comparable results","fold","study","humans","Canine hepacivirus","finding","question","aim"],"language":"en"},

The legs and mouthparts are generally involved in mechanical transmission of microbes. However, the crop is involved in more than just mechanical transmission, for it is within the lumen of the crop that microbes are taken up with the meal of the fly, stored, and it is within the lumen that horizontal transmission of bacterial resistance has been demonstrated. In addition to storage of microbes, the crop is also involved in depositing the microbes via a process known as regurgitation. Various aspects of crop regulation are discussed and specific examples of crop involvement with microorganisms are discussed.

Few studies have investigated the clinical predictors of viral pneumonia, and the results have been inconsistent. In this study, the clinical predictors of viral pneumonia were investigated in terms of their utility as indicators for viral pneumonia in patients with CAP. METHODS: Adult patients (\u226518 years old) with CAP, tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory virus, at two teaching hospitals between October 2010 and May 2013, were identified retrospectively. Demographic and clinical data were collected by reviewing the hospital electronic medical records. RESULTS: During the study period, 456 patients with CAP were identified who met the definition, and 327 (72%) patients were tested using the respiratory virus PCR detection test. Viral pneumonia (n = 60) was associated with rhinorrhea, a higher lymphocyte fraction in the white blood cells, lower serum creatinine and ground-glass opacity (GGO) in radiology results, compared to non-viral pneumonia (n = 250) (p\u003C0.05, each). In a multivariate analysis, rhinorrhea (Odd ratio (OR) 3.52; 95% Confidence interval (CI), 1.58\u20137.87) and GGO (OR 4.68; 95% CI, 2.48\u20138.89) were revealed as independent risk factors for viral pneumonia in patients with CAP. The sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values (PPV and NPV) of rhinorrhea were 22, 91, 36 and 83%: the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of GGO were and 43, 84, 40 and 86%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Symptom of rhinorrhea and GGO predicted viral pneumonia in patients with CAP. The high specificity of rhinorrhea and GGO suggested that these could be useful indicators for empirical antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2014-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ji Eun; Kim, Uh Jin; Kim, Hee Kyung; Cho, Soo Kyung; An, Joon Hwan; Kang, Seung-Ji; Park, Kyung-Hwa; Jung, Sook-In; Jang, Hee-Chang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb40c00778d84e091401be93269dff07a63f2c19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4273967.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531901/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0114710","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","GGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-viral pneumonia","clinical predictors of viral pneumonia","Adult patients","NPV of GGO","high specificity of rhinorrhea","CAP","Symptom of rhinorrhea","PPV","radiology results","sensitivity","clinical data","respiratory virus PCR detection test","useful indicators","study period","white blood cells","lower serum creatinine","ground-glass opacity","higher lymphocyte fraction","negative-predictive values","polymerase chain reaction","METHODS","independent risk factors","empirical antiviral therapy","multivariate analysis","Odd ratio","major causes of community","years old","terms","utility","hospital electronic medical records","Viruses","teaching hospitals","CONCLUSION","Confidence interval","studies","BACKGROUND","definition"],"language":"en"},

Numerous receptor isoforms are now known, and each has extensive differences in its amino terminal immunoglobulin-like domain (NTD) to which MHV binds via its protruding spike proteins. Some of these receptor alterations may affect the ability to bind viral spikes. To identify individual residues controlling virus binding differences, we have used plasmid and vaccinia virus vectors to express two forms of MHV receptor differing only in their NTD. The two receptors, designated biliary glycoproteins (Bgp) 1aand 1b NTD, varied by 29 residues in the 107 amino acid NTD. When expressed from cDNAs in receptor-negative HeLa cells, these two Bgp molecules were displayed on cell surfaces to equivalent levels, as both were equally modified by a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. Infectious center assays revealed that the 1aisoform was 10 to 100 times more effective than 1b NTDin its ability to confer sensitivity to MHV (strain A59) infection. Bgp1awas also more effective than Bgp1b NTDin comparative virus adsorption assays, binding 6 times more MHV (strain A59) and 2.5 times more MHV (strain JHMX). Bgp1awas similarly more effective in promoting the capacity of viral spikes to mediate intercellular membrane fusion as judged by quantitation of syncytia following cocultivation of spike and receptor-bearing cells. To identify residues influencing these differences, we inserted varying numbers of 1bresidues into the Bgp1abackground via restriction fragment exchange and site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of the resulting chimeric receptors showed that residues 38 to 43 of the NTD were key determinants of the binding and fusion differences between the two receptors. These residues map to an exposed loop (C-C\u2032 loop) in a structural model of the closely related human carcinoembryonic antigen.","publish_time":"1997-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, Pasupuleti V.; Kumari, Suman; Gallagher, Thomas M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c1be37ccfe948d15ff425108a7eedc9bc6be53f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297984464; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297984464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus binding differences","forms of MHV receptor","times","fusion differences","residues map","individual residues","receptor alterations","amino acid NTD","extensive differences","strain A59","receptor-negative HeLa cells","Numerous receptor isoforms","vaccinia virus vectors","C-C","ability","resulting chimeric receptors","strain JHMX","Bgp1awas","Bgp1b NTDin comparative virus adsorption assays","intercellular membrane fusion","capacity of viral spikes","enveloped coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","Bgp molecules","exposed loop","cocultivation of spike","amino terminal immunoglobulin","Infectious center assays","protruding spike proteins","human carcinoembryonic antigen","Abstract Murine carcinoembryonic antigens","membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent","Bgp1abackground","entry","sensitivity","restriction fragment exchange","quantitation of syncytia","site","bresidues","cell surfaces","domain","plasmid","key determinants","structural model","cDNAs","varying numbers","equivalent levels","mutagenesis","Analysis","aisoform","biliary glycoproteins","infection"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: There were a total of 615 KD patients (mean age: 29.7 months; male-to-female ratio = 1.6:1), including 228 incomplete KD patients. Incomplete KD patients had milder values in some laboratory indices. The preadmission and total fever durations were longer in group A than in group B. The proportion of incomplete KD was higher in group B, but incidence of coronary artery lesions (CALs) was lower. For laboratory indices, the C-reactive protein and follow-up platelet values were lower, and the hemoglobin and albumin values were higher in group B. The same clinical and laboratory findings were confirmed in the KD subgroups; those with the same fever duration of 5 or 6 days and same ages, those with complete KD, and those with incomplete KD in the two different time periods.

In medicine, protease inhibitors can be used as diagnostic or therapeutic agents for viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases as well as for treating cancer and immunological, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. They can be involved in crop protection against plant pathogens and herbivorous pests as well as against abiotic stress such as drought. Furthermore, protease inhibitors are indispensable in protein purification procedures to prevent undesired proteolysis during heterologous expression or protein extraction. They are also valuable tools for simple and effective purification of proteases, using affinity chromatography.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF\u03BAB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sawalha, Amr H.; Zhao, Ming; Coit, Patrick; Lu, Qianjin","journal":"Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/815d63332a3db5340c7e894ad467520c2af77daa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7139239.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661620302394; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661620302394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276140/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lupus patients","SARS-CoV","lupus treatment","systemic lupus erythematous","severe COVID","ACE2 hypomethylation","excessive immune response","ACE2 gene","severe disease course","overexpression of ACE2","key cytokine genes","increased oxidative stress","compromised immune system","severe respiratory complications","viral infections","regulated genes","viral entry","demethylation of interferon","enhanced viremia","Epigenetic control","disease remission","Abstract Infection","vicious cycle of demethylation","inherent epigenetic dysregulation","likelihood of cytokine storm","NF\u03BAB","target","DNA methylation defect","functional receptor","immunosuppressed state","prevention","susceptibility","X chromosome","therapy","arguments","addition","death","spike glycoprotein","current pandemic","report","evidence"],"language":"en"},

AI is already deployed widely and has a high impact on work and daily life activities. The continuation of this process will likely contribute to deep economic and social changes. To realise the tremendous benefits of AI while mitigating undesirable effects will require enlightened responses by many stakeholders. Varying national institutional, economic, political, and cultural conditions will influence how AI will affect convenience, efficiency, personalisation, privacy protection, and surveillance of citizens. Many expect that the winners of the AI development race will dominate the coming decades economically and geopolitically, potentially exacerbating tensions between countries. Moreover, nations are under pressure to protect their citizens and their interests\u2014and even their own political stability\u2014in the face of possible malicious or biased uses of AI. On the one hand, these different stressors and emphases in AI development and deployment among nations risk a fragmentation between world regions that threatens technology evolution and collaboration. On the other hand, some level of differentiation will likely enrich the global AI ecosystem in ways that stimulate innovation and introduce competitive checks and balances through the decentralisation of AI development. International cooperation, typically orchestrated by intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector initiatives, and by academic researchers, has improved common welfare and avoided undesirable outcomes in other technology areas. Because AI will most likely have more fundamental effects on our lives than other recent technologies, stronger forms of cooperation that address broader policy and governance challenges in addition to regulatory and technological issues may be needed. At a time of great challenges among nations, international policy coordination remains a necessary instrument to tackle the ethical, cultural, economic, and political repercussions of AI. We propose to advance the emerging concept of technology diplomacy to facilitate the global alignment of AI policy and governance and create a vibrant AI innovation system. We argue that the prevention of malicious uses of AI and the enhancement of human welfare create strong common interests across jurisdictions that require sustained efforts to develop better, mutually beneficial approaches. We hope that new technology diplomacy will facilitate the dialogues necessary to help all interested parties develop a shared understanding and coordinate efforts to utilise AI for the benefit of humanity, a task whose difficulty should not be underestimated.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feij\u00F3o, Claudio; Kwon, Youngsun; Bauer, Johannes M.; Bohlin, Erik; Howell, Bronwyn; Jain, Rekha; Potgieter, Petrus; Vu, Khuong; Whalley, Jason; Xia, Jun","journal":"Telecomm Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e766781a7700615af717dbbf8089ea46a4bb314.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200378.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377031/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030859612030080X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030859612030080X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AI development race","decentralisation of AI development","political repercussions of AI","biased uses of AI","global AI ecosystem","tremendous benefits of AI","global alignment of AI policy","prevention of malicious uses of AI","vibrant AI innovation system","nations","technology evolution","technology areas","new technology diplomacy","broader policy","governance challenges","common welfare","international policy coordination","undesirable effects","International cooperation","emerging concept of technology diplomacy","political stability","hand","strong common interests","dialogues necessary","necessary instrument","undesirable outcomes","cultural conditions","sustained efforts","fundamental effects","technological issues","surveillance of citizens","enhancement of human welfare","stronger forms of cooperation","face of possible malicious","time of great challenges","key technological enablers","private sector initiatives","addition","non-governmental organisations","jurisdictions","balances","emphases","privacy protection","recent technologies","academic researchers","world regions","work","personalisation","consolidation","lives","interested parties","efficiency","fragmentation","ways","different stressors","deployment","daily life activities","high impact","competitive checks","shared understanding","enlightened responses","convenience","coming decades","benefit of humanity","task","period of intense progress","process","social changes","collaboration","field of artificial intelligence","level of differentiation","winners","exacerbating tensions","countries","difficulty","stakeholders","pressure","beneficial approaches","continuation"],"language":"en"},

Vitamin D may be important for immune function. Studies to date have shown an inconsistent association between vitamin D and infection with respiratory viruses. The purpose of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was associated with laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children. Methods. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at baseline and children from Canadian Hutterite communities were followed prospectively during the respiratory virus season. Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained if symptoms developed and infections were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction. The association between serum 25(OH)D and time to laboratory-confirmed viral RTI was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results. Seven hundred forty-three children aged 3\u201315 years were followed between 22 December 2008 and 23 June 2009. The median serum 25(OH)D level was 62.0 nmol/L (interquartile range, 51.0\u201374.0). A total of 229 participants (31%) developed at least 1 laboratory-confirmed viral RTI. Younger age and lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of viral RTI. Serum 25(OH)D levels \u003C75 nmol/L increased the risk of viral RTI by 50% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10\u20132.07, P = .011) and levels \u003C50 nmol/L increased the risk by 70% (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.16\u20132.40, P = .006). Conclusions. Lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of laboratory-confirmed viral RTI in children from Canadian Hutterite communities.

Pathogen levels exceeded the guideline values recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at most locations throughout the year. The social survey provided information about exposure of the population in age groups. Only 31% of the recreational users belonged to the healthy adult group upon which the WHO quantitative microbial risk assessment model is based. A correlation was established between microbial water quality and incidence of respiratory diseases for children as well as for adults. Exposure to recreational water increased the incidence of respiratory illnesses for the whole population almost by a factor 2.

Astrocytes are one of the major targets for MHV infection in the CNS, and respond to MHV infection by expressing diverse molecules that may contribute to CNS pathogenesis. Here we characterized the activation of an immediate-early transcription factor Egr-1 by MHV infection in an astrocytoma cell line. We found that the expression of Egr-1 was dramatically increased following virus infection. Using various inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases, we identified that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 were involved in the activation of Egr-1 transcription by MHV infection. Experiments with ultraviolet light-inactivated virus revealed that the induction of Egr-1 did not require virus replication and was likely mediated during cell entry. We further found that over-expression of Egr-1 suppressed the expression of BNip3, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. This finding may provide an explanation for our previously observed down-regulation of BNip3 by MHV infection in astrocytoma cells (Cai, Liu, Yu, and Zhang, Virology 316:104\u2013115, 2003). Furthermore, knockdown of Egr-1 by an siRNA inhibited MHV propagation, suggesting the biological relevance of Egr-1 induction to virus replication. In addition, the persistence/demylinating-positive strains (JHM and A59) induced Egr-1 expression, whereas the persistence/demylinating-negative strain (MHV-2) did not. These results indicate a correlation between the ability of MHVs to induce Egr-1 expression and their ability to cause demyelination in the CNS, which may suggest a potential role for the induction of Egr-1 in viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2006-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Yingyun; Liu, Yin; Zhang, Xuming","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a91e76329990d31ca420f0c82ceba12a79d0688c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1851928.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206004533; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206004533","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Liu","Yu","Zhang"],"organizations":["CNS","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV infection","induction of Egr","activation of Egr","knockdown of Egr","over-expression of Egr","biological relevance of Egr","following virus infection","expression of BNip3","virus replication","immediate-early transcription factor Egr","CNS pathogenesis","siRNA inhibited MHV propagation","persistence","demyelination","ultraviolet light-inactivated virus","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","astrocytoma cell line","astrocytoma cells","regulation of BNip3","ability of MHVs","cell entry","viral pathogenesis","demylinating-positive strains","activated protein kinases","demylinating-negative strain","extracellular signal-regulated kinases","encephalitis","Cai","central nervous system","Yu","Liu","pro-apoptotic member","JHM","A59","various inhibitors of mitogen","major targets","diverse molecules","Bcl","Experiments","susceptible rodents","potential role","Zhang","correlation","Virology","family","Astrocytes","results","addition","finding","explanation"],"language":"en"},

Sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-like virus in masked palm civets indicated that they were highly homologous to human SARS-CoV with nt identity over 99.6%, indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm civets for a very long time. Alignment of 10 complete viral genome sequences from masked palm civets with those of human SARS-CoVs revealed 26 conserved single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the viruses from masked palm civets. These conserved SNVs were gradually lost from the genomes of viruses isolated from the early phase to late phase human patients of the 2003 SARS epidemic. In 2005, horseshoe bats were identified as the natural reservoir of a group of coronaviruses that are distantly related to SARS-CoV.

The role cystatins play in respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD is poorly understood. However, they do modulate the immune response by acting directly on neutrophils, macrophages, and antigen presenting cells. It is also clear that they do not function independently of other proteolytic pathways involved in remodeling of the lung. Limited proteolysis inactivates cystatins allowing lysosomal CP activity to directly contribute to lung tissue degradation and also liberates kinins which signal through G-protein-coupled receptors to cause both constriction and dilation of the bronchioles, pain via stimulation of sensory nerves, mucus secretion, cough, and edema.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pemberton, P.

The 2009 Hajj took place during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. This study investigates factors associated with compliance with recommended influenza A (H1N1)-related health practices and behaviors among American pilgrims to the 2009 Hajj: receiving seasonal influenza vaccinations, receiving influenza A (H1N1) vaccinations, and behaviors intended to mitigate respiratory illness. METHODS American residents from Minnesota and Michigan completed anonymous surveys prior to and following travel to the 2009 Hajj. Surveys assessed demographics; knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to influenza A (H1N1); seasonal and H1N1 vaccinations; health-seeking behaviors; sources of health information; and protective behaviors during the Hajj. RESULTS Pre- and post-travel surveys were completed by 186 participants. Receiving seasonal influenza vaccination was reported by 138 (63%) respondents, and 80 (36%) reported receiving an influenza A (H1N1) vaccine. One hundred forty-four (79%) respondents reported engaging in protective behaviors during the Hajj to prevent illness. In multivariable models, greater perceived severity of influenza A (H1N1) before traveling was associated with: seasonal influenza vaccination (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.14-2.62, p=.01), influenza A (H1N1) vaccination (OR=2.02, 95% CI=1.35-3.02, p=.001), and engaging in protective behaviors during the Hajj (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.00-2.63, p=.003). CONCLUSIONS This study found that accurate knowledge of influenza A (H1N1) symptoms, transmission, and prevention was associated with greater perceived severity of influenza A (H1N1); and perceived influenza A (H1N1) severity was associated with engaging in recommended protective health practices. Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of compliance with recommended behaviors can help guide the development of tailored outreach strategies to mitigate the impact and spread of respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balaban, V.; Stauffer, W.; Hammad, A.; Afgarshe, M.; Abd-Alla, M.; Ahmed, Q.; Memish, Z.; Saba, J.; Harton, E.; Palumbo, G.; Marano, N.","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af727b3b7ce0f36a315faf8245e6adacc8c9c982.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128170.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600613000853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24206790/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210600613000853; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2013.08.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Minnesota","Michigan"],"keyphrases":["perceived influenza","recommended influenza","H1N1 vaccinations","seasonal influenza vaccinations","Hajj","protective behaviors","accurate knowledge of influenza","greater perceived severity of influenza","recommended behaviors","recommended protective health practices","related health practices","engaging","respiratory illness","sources of health information","anonymous surveys","post-travel surveys","study","BACKGROUND Respiratory","respiratory disease","respondents","American pilgrims","facilitators of compliance","METHODS American residents","Minnesota","Michigan","impact","attitudes","prevention","infectious diseases","multivariable models","development of tailored outreach strategies","RESULTS Pre-","demographics","KAP","symptoms","factors","traveling","CONCLUSIONS","transmission","place","mass gatherings","barriers","participants","vaccine","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, we studied the genetic variability and the phylogeographic pattern of the masked palm civet Paguma larvata. First, two portions of mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and the control region, were sequenced for a total of 76 individuals sampled from China, the Indochinese region and the Sundaic region. Results indicated a low genetic variability and suggested a lack of a phylogeographic structure in this species, which do not allow inferring the geographic origin of samples of unknown origin, although it is possible to distinguish individuals from China and the Sundaic region. This low variation is in contrast to the well\u2010marked morphological differentiation between the populations in the Sundaic and Chinese\u2013Indochinese regions. We also used five microsatellite loci to genotype 149 samples from two wild and four farmed populations in China, where the masked palm civet is farmed and where the SARS coronavirus was isolated. These analyses also showed a reduced variability in Chinese civets and showed that farmed populations did not exhibit a lower genetic diversity than wild populations, suggesting frequent introductions of wild individuals into farms.","publish_time":"2009-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patou, M.\u2010L.; Chen, J.; Cosson, L.; Andersen, D.

Physiologically, Mg(2\u002B) is used as a co-factor by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including Mn(2\u002B), Co(2\u002B), and Zn(2\u002B) can also support catalysis. Although Zn(2\u002B) supports DNA synthesis, it inhibits HIV RT by significantly modifying RT catalysis. Zn(2\u002B) is currently being investigated as a component of novel treatment options against HIV and we wanted to investigate the fidelity of RT with Zn(2\u002B). METHODS: We used PCR-based and plasmid-based alpha complementation assays as well as steady-state misinsertion and misincorporation assays to examine the fidelity of RT with Mn(2\u002B), Co(2\u002B), and Zn(2\u002B). RESULTS: The fidelity of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT was approximately 2.5 fold greater in Zn(2\u002B) when compared to Mg(2\u002B) at cation conditions optimized for nucleotide catalysis. Consistent with this, RT extended primers with mismatched 3\u2032 nucleotides poorly and inserted incorrect nucleotides less efficiently using Zn(2\u002B) than Mg(2\u002B). In agreement with previous literature, we observed that Mn(2\u002B) and Co(2\u002B) dramatically decreased the fidelity of RT at highly elevated concentrations (6 mM). However, surprisingly, the fidelity of HIV RT with Mn(2\u002B) and Co(2\u002B) remained similar to Mg(2\u002B) at lower concentrations that are optimal for catalysis. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Zn(2\u002B), at optimal extension conditions, increases the fidelity of HIV-1 RT and challenges the notion that alternative cations capable of supporting polymerase catalysis are inherently mutagenic.","publish_time":"2015-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Achuthan, Vasudevan; DeStefano, Jeffrey J","journal":"BMC Biochem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3adf3be72d751812577d37b2f3db193b2b93cc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4472245.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12858-015-0041-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV RT","RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fidelity of RT","RT catalysis","Zn","fidelity of HIV RT","RT extended primers","fidelity of DNA synthesis","Mn","Fidelity of DNA polymerases","nucleotide catalysis","HIV reverse transcriptase","alternative cations capable of supporting polymerase catalysis","cation conditions","cation co-factors","optimal extension conditions","misincorporation assays","lower concentrations","elevated concentrations","alpha complementation assays","inserted incorrect nucleotides","steady-state misinsertion","notion","plasmid","component of novel treatment options","previous literature","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","fold greater","PCR","agreement","CONCLUSION","study","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

A complete blood count and plasma biochemistry revealed a severe nonregenerative anemia, azotemia, hyperproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and mild hyperphosphatemia and hyperchloremia. Urinalysis revealed hyposthenuria. Whole body radiographs showed multifocal thoracic nodular disease, splenomegaly, and renomegaly. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed bilaterally enlarged kidneys, hypoechoic liver and spleen, and a caudal abdominal hypoechoic mobile nodule. The ferret was humanely euthanized, and a postmortem examination with subsequent histopathology showed multifocal necrotizing pyogranulomas in the lung, spleen, kidneys, mesenteric lymph nodes, and serosa of the duodenum. Pyogranulomatous panophthalmitis was diagnosed in the left eye. The multisystemic granulomatous lesions were suggestive of ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV).

Recently a combinatorial product with toltrazuril plus iron has been developed for parenteral application. In this study we compared the efficacy of the injectable product with the oral suspension against experimentally induced piglet cystoisosporosis. METHODS: In a randomised controlled study, three groups of piglets (n = 10\u201313) were treated either with a fixed dose of 45 mg toltrazuril \u002B 200 mg gleptoferron i.m. per piglet (Forceris\u00AE) on the second day of life (study day 2; SD 2) or with 20 mg toltrazuril/kg body weight as an oral suspension (Baycox\u00AE 5%) on SD 4 or left untreated (Control group). The Baycox\u00AE and the Control group received 200 mg of iron dextran/piglet on SD 2. All piglets were infected with 1000 sporulated C. suis oocysts on SD 3. Faecal samples were taken daily from SD 7 to SD 20 to determine faecal consistency, oocyst shedding and other diarrhoeal pathogens. Body weight was recorded on SD 1 and then weekly until SD 29. Animals were observed daily for general health and after treatment for possible adverse events. RESULTS: In the Control group all animals shed oocysts for 3.1 days on average and all animals showed diarrhoea for an average of five days. Excretion peaked on SD 9 (max. 48,618 oocysts per gram of faeces). Treatment with Forceris\u00AE completely suppressed oocyst excretion. In the Baycox\u00AE group, low levels of excretion could be detected. Diarrhoea was reduced to single piglets in the treated groups. Body weight development was reduced in the Control group compared to the treated groups. Enteropathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens) could be detected. All parameters related to oocyst excretion, faecal consistency and weight gain were significantly improved in the treated groups compared to the Control group without significant differences between the treated groups.

We developed a mathematical model for investigating and predicting the effects of lockdown on future COVID-19 cases with a specific focus on India. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and validate a mathematical model and to assess the impact of various lockdown scenarios on COVID-19 transmission in India. METHODS: A model consisting of a framework of ordinary differential equations was developed by incorporating the actual reported cases in 14 countries. After validation, the model was applied to predict COVID-19 transmission in India for different intervention scenarios in terms of lockdown for 4, 14, 21, 42, and 60 days. We also assessed the situations of enhanced exposure due to aggregation of individuals in transit stations and shopping malls before the lockdown. RESULTS: The developed model is efficient in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases compared to the actual reported cases in 14 countries. For India, the model predicted marked reductions in cases for the intervention periods of 14 and 21 days of lockdown and significant reduction for 42 days of lockdown. Such intervention exceeding 42 days does not result in measurable improvement. Finally, for the scenario of \u201Cpanic shopping\u201D or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India. Any relaxation in the lockdown may lead to exponential transmission, resulting in a heavy burden on the health care system in the country.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ambikapathy, Bakiya; Krishnamurthy, Kamalanand","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365045/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19368","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["days of lockdown","transmission of COVID","India","developed model","terms of lockdown","strict lockdown","effects of lockdown","mathematical model","number of COVID","future COVID","exponential transmission","impact of various lockdown scenarios","actual reported cases","intervention periods","different intervention scenarios","considered intervention strategy","countries","OBJECTIVE","World Health Organization","health care system","public health emergency","situations of enhanced exposure","higher exposure","shopping malls","panic shopping","aggregation of individuals","transit stations","heavy burden","marked reductions","factors","novel coronavirus disease","present","infection","failure","significant reduction","major threat of community spread","framework of ordinary differential equations","sudden increase","specific focus","BACKGROUND","country","CONCLUSIONS","Implementation","RESULTS","measurable improvement","extension","METHODS","validation","relaxation"],"language":"en"},

The cellular factors required for DTMUV replication have been poorly studied. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major intracellular proteolytic pathway, mediates diverse cellular processes, including endocytosis and signal transduction, which may be involved in the entry of virus. In the present study, we explored the interplay between DTMUV replication and the UPS in BHK-21 cells and found that treatment with proteasome inhibitor (MG132 and lactacystin) significantly decreased the DTMUV progency at the early infection stage. We further revealed that inhibition of the UPS mainly occurs on the level of viral protein expression and RNA transcription. In addition, using specific siRNAs targeting ubiquitin reduces the production of viral progeny. In the presence of MG132 the staining for the envelope protein of DTMUV was dramatically reduced in comparison with the untreated control cells. Overall, our observations reveal an important role of the UPS in multiple steps of the DTMUV infection cycle and identify the UPS as a potential drug target to modulate the impact of DTMUV infection.","publish_time":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Kaikai; Zhao, Dongmin; Liu, Yuzhuo; Liu, Qingtao; Huang, Xinmei; Yang, Jing; Zhang, Lijiao; Li, Yin","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c7b7806f2bc2ca8d57689464e83ae10acb9f411.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126904.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.04.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054366/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401019301421; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401019301421","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["UPS","DTMUV replication","DTMUV progency","impact of DTMUV infection","DTMUV infection cycle","envelope protein of DTMUV","ubiquitin-proteasome system","early infection stage","Duck Tembusu virus","level of viral protein expression","duck industry","cellular factors","proteasome inhibitor","presence of MG132","entry of virus","diverse cellular processes","production of viral progeny","untreated control cells","massive economic losses","multiple steps","major intracellular proteolytic pathway","endocytosis","staining","lactacystin","interplay","emerging pathogenic flavivirus","RNA transcription","important role","potential drug target","specific siRNAs","treatment","comparison","BHK","signal transduction","addition","China","present study","observations","inhibition"],"language":"en"},

Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. METHODS: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. FINDINGS: From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7\u00B71 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 4\u00B78\u201310\u00B79) from version 1 to 2, 2\u00B78 times (1\u00B79\u20134\u00B72) from version 2 to 4, and 4\u00B72 times (2\u00B76\u20137\u00B73) from version 4 to 5. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232 000 (95% CrI 161 000\u2013359 000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55 508 confirmed cases reported. INTERPRETATION: The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases. These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

It is based on case study research of a company in the international marine industry, which intended to switch one of its key suppliers for a new one as a result of cost-cutting strategies and dissatisfaction with the old supplier. The case study describes the process, which ended with the old supplier being only partially switched. The findings show how (partial) switching from one supplier to another happened via three key sub-processes and associated practices, which the involved actors in the case drew upon in the switching process: (1) initiation \u2013 a process enabled by legitimizing and search practices; (2) substitution \u2013 a process enabled by transfer, translation, and transformation practices; and (3a) stabilization \u2013 a process enabled by institutionalizing practices; and (3b) restoration \u2013 a process whereby the old supplier is retained as a result of new conditions, this retention being enabled by certain repair practices. By identifying the processes and practices that enable switching to happen, the findings offer an initial conceptualization of supplier-switching processes, which comprises an important and heretofore underexplored aspect of supplier switching. The research highlights the importance of recognizing how relationships embedded in interorganizational routines are produced and reproduced in the switching process through the actions and interactions of the actors involved.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bygballe, Lena E.","journal":"Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ee6f0a9583884368770842a17b0aef55e2ab391.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1478409216300206; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1478409216300206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["switching process","old supplier","associated practices","institutionalizing practices","transformation practices","search practices","initial conceptualization of supplier","underexplored aspect of supplier","certain repair practices","case study research","key sub-processes","involved actors","findings","result of new conditions","business relationships","key suppliers","result of cost-cutting strategies","company","retention","transfer","dissatisfaction","importance of recognizing","practice perspective","translation","substitution","interactions","international marine industry","interorganizational routines","paper","restoration","initiation","stabilization"],"language":"en"},

The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens\u00AE Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 10(4) RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens\u00AE Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the \u2018gold standard\u2019. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent. Our results suggest that the NucliSens\u00AE Basic Kit assay provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for detecting NV RNA in stool specimens.

We have examined the impact on suicides following the death of a famous Hong Kong pop singer whose death from suicide by jumping from a height, occurred on 1st April 2003, and resulted in extensive and often dramatic media coverage. Methods Data on suicides were obtained from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department and the Coroner\u0027s Court. The numbers of suicides in 2003 before and after the death of celebrity were compared to the same period in 1998\u20132002.

The objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United Kingdom stratified by age, risk and influenza vaccination status. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional, exploratory, observational study used linked data from the General Practice Research Database and the Hospital Episode Statistics databases to estimate resource use and cost associated with ILI in the UK. RESULTS: Data were included from 156,193 patients with \u22651 general practitioner visit with ILI. There were 21,518 high-risk patients, of whom 12,514 (58.2%) were vaccinated and 9,004 (41.8%) were not vaccinated, and 134,675 low-risk patients, of whom 17,482 (13.0%) were vaccinated and 117,193 (87.0%) were not vaccinated. High-risk vaccinated patients were older (p\u003C0.001) and had more risk conditions (p\u003C0.001). High-risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.16) or vaccinated (OR 1.19) patients had a higher probability of \u003E1 general practitioner visit compared with low-risk and unvaccinated patients. Patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a reduced risk of \u003E1 general practitioner visit (OR 0.82; p\u003C0.001). High-risk individuals who were also vaccinated had a lower probability of ILI-related hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk or vaccinated alone (OR 0.59). In people aged \u226565 years, the mortality rate was lower in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals (OR 0.75). The cost of ILI-related GP visits and hospital admissions in the UK over the study period in low-risk vaccinated patients was \u00A327,391,142 and \u00A3141,932,471, respectively. In low-risk unvaccinated patients the corresponding values were \u00A3168,318,709 and \u00A3112,534,130, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccination rates in target groups have increased, many people are still not receiving influenza vaccination, and the burden of ILI in the United Kingdom remains substantial. Improving influenza vaccination uptake may have the potential to reduce this burden.","publish_time":"2015-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pockett, Rhys D.; Watkins, John; McEwan, Phil; Meier, Genevieve","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78646cec8be584199a96490a43bf47b2fd542f63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4546056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26287532/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134928","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["High-risk vaccinated patients","low-risk vaccinated patients","high-risk patients","low-risk patients","low-risk unvaccinated patients","burden of ILI","influenza burden","High-risk individuals","cost of ILI","reduced risk","risk conditions","lower probability of ILI","general practitioner visit","influenza vaccination status","influenza vaccination uptake","United Kingdom","UK","unvaccinated individuals","vaccination rates","disease burden","linked data","observational study","study period","Detailed data","people","OBJECTIVE","General Practice Research Database","hospital admissions","related hospitalisation","higher probability","related GP visits","Hospital Episode Statistics databases","resource use","age","target groups","mortality rate","corresponding values","retrospective","years","potential","illness","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","odds ratio","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods: DALYs were estimated using an incidence-based and pathogen-based approach. Incidence was estimated through assessment of data availability and quality, and a correction was applied for under-estimation. Calculation of DALYs was performed with the BCoDE software toolkit without applying time discounting and age-weighting. Results: We estimated that one in 14 inhabitants experienced an infectious disease episode for a total burden of 1.38 million DALYs (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.25\u20131.5) between 2009 and 2013; 76% of which was related to the acute phase of the infection and its short-term complications. Influenza had the highest burden (30% of the total burden), followed by tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/AIDS and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Men had the highest burden measured in DALYs (60% of the total), adults 65 years of age and over had 24% and children less than 5 years of age had 11%. Age group-specific burden showed that infants (less than 1 year of age) and elderly people (80 years of age and over) experienced the highest burden. Conclusions: These results provide baseline estimates for evaluating infectious disease prevention and control strategies. The study promotes an evidence-based approach to describing population health and assessing surveillance data availability and quality, and provides information for the planning and prioritisation of limited resources in infectious disease prevention and control.","publish_time":"2018-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cassini, Alessandro; Colzani, Edoardo; Pini, Alessandro; Mangen, Marie-Josee J; Plass, Dietrich; McDonald, Scott A; Maringhini, Guido; van Lier, Alies; Haagsma, Juanita A; Havelaar, Arie H; Kramarz, Piotr; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/454c099b504f30d078e4fff12a3212dcc5567e97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5915974.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2018.23.16.17-00454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29692315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU","European Economic Area"],"locations":["Europe","European Union"],"keyphrases":["total burden","years of age","highest burden","Age group-specific burden","year of age","age-weighting","Burden of Communicable Diseases","infectious disease prevention","Calculation of DALYs","infectious disease episode","infection","invasive pneumococcal disease","quality","study","evidence-based approach","pathogen-based approach","incidence","Results","disability-adjusted life years","surveillance data availability","assessment of data availability","European Union","selected diseases","control strategies","European Economic Area","BCoDE software toolkit","HIV","AIDS","population health","prioritisation of limited resources","time discounting","tuberculosis","baseline estimates","human immunodeficiency virus","elderly people","planning","correction","IPD","information","infants","EEA","Conclusions","uncertainty interval","inhabitants","adults","acute phase","short-term complications","under-estimation","UI","Influenza","children","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The basis of the assay is the cleavage of target RNA by RNase H mediated by sequence-specific chimeric oligonucleotides followed by sample to residual ratio quantitation (SRRQ) using RRT-PCR. Four serotype-specific chimeric oligonucleotides were designed, one each for the Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, and Delaware/Georgia 98 serotypes, and tested for their ability to mediate specific cleavage of target RNA from known homologous and heterologous strains of IBV. Specific cleavage of target RNAs by each chimeric oligonucleotide was verified using agarose gel analysis and RRT-PCR. There were no non-specific cleavage products. Eight different IBV strains representing seven serotypes were tested and each chimeric oligonucleotide mediated cleavage of target RNA only from strains within the serotype that the chimeric was designed against. The SRRQ assay was evaluated on 15 samples without prior knowledge of their grouping and correctly identified the serotype of each sample. The assay is rapid; six samples can be tested in approximately 4h. In addition, the primer set amplifies all IBV RNAs tested to date and provides a built in control for detecting IBV whether it is typeable or not.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callison, S.

A small-animal model for HCV infection would significantly expedite antiviral compound development and preclinical testing, as well as open new avenues to decipher the mechanisms that underlie viral pathogenesis. The natural species tropism of HCV is, however, limited to humans and chimpanzees. Here, we discuss the prospects of developing a mouse model for HCV infection, taking into consideration recent results on HCV entry and replication, and new prospects in xenotransplantation biology. We highlight three independent, but possibly complementary, approaches towards overcoming current species barriers and generating a small-animal model for HCV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2009-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ploss, Alexander; Rice, Charles M.","journal":"EMBO reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4853f827169f210739166083741a7be37a66003.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2775186.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/embor.2009.223; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2775186?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19834510/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV pathogenesis","HCV entry","therapy of HCV infection","natural species tropism of HCV","small-animal model","new prospects","mouse model","viral pathogenesis","open new avenues","current species barriers","replication","consideration recent results","antiviral compound development","preclinical testing","approaches","mechanisms","chronic liver disease","interferon-based treatments","Hepatitis C virus","prevention","xenotransplantation biology","world\u0027s population","effects","vaccine","Options","humans","chimpanzees"],"language":"en"},

It is important to know the microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics for fast and accurate treatment of acute exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The last Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) publication recommended a new staging system containing obstruction degree, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life questionnaires. This study is designed to analyze the relationship between the bacteria isolated in acute exacerbations and new GOLD stages. METHODS: Potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) isolation with culture and polymerase chain reaction methods were obtained from 114 acute exacerbation COPD patients, classified into A, B, C, and D groups by analyzing the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) value, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, and exacerbation frequency according to the new GOLD staging system. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between exacerbation frequency and PPB isolation (P=0.002). There was no relationship between GOLD stage, FEV(1), and CAT score with PPB isolation. The isolated bacteria diversity and mixed infection frequency were higher in the GOLD stage D group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated only from D group patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection may cause an acute exacerbation equally in each stage for COPD. The difference in bacterial etiology is more related to exacerbation frequency than FEV(1) and CAT scores for an acute exacerbation. Determining exacerbation frequency is significant for treatment success in empirical antibiotic selection.","publish_time":"2014-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aydemir, Yusuf; Aydemir, \u00D6zlem; Kalem, Fatma","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f5d545fbca8b7c83ff7b10f827d772cb0011aa4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4186572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298733/; https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s70620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease","COPD Assessment","PPB","FEV","COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exacerbation frequency","frequency of exacerbations","acute exacerbation COPD patients","accurate treatment of acute exacerbations","GOLD stage D group","mixed infection frequency","new GOLD staging system","PPB isolation","new GOLD stages","FEV","D groups","new staging system","D group patients","isolated bacteria diversity","significant cause of mortality","Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease","significant correlation","Bacterial infection","CAT scores","pathogenic bacteria","COPD Assessment Test","relationship","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","treatment success","patient groups","bacterial etiology","loss of lung function","polymerase chain reaction methods","prognosis","culture","publication","Global Initiative","morbidity","obstruction degree","functional characteristics","Escherichia coli","Acinetobacter baumannii","value","empirical antibiotic selection","forced expiratory volume","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","quality of life questionnaires","difference","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","microorganisms","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

Better understanding of factors that explain variations in resistance between individuals and families is essential for development of strategies for disease control. To approach this, we compared global gene expression using microarrays in fish dying early and late in the time course following infection from a highly pathogenic ISAV. RESULTS: Tissues (gill, heart, liver and spleen) from infected Atlantic salmon (cohabitation, ISAV Glesvaer 2/90 isolate) were collected from three stages over the time course of the experiment; early (EM, 0\u201310% cumulative mortality (CM), 21\u201325 days post-infection (DPI)), intermediate (IM, 35\u201355% CM, 28\u201331 DPI) and late (LM, 75\u201385% CM, 37\u201348 DPI) mortality. Viral loads were equal in EM and IM but dropped markedly in LM fish. Gene expression analyses using a 1.8 K salmonid fish cDNA microarray (SFA2.0) and real-time qPCR revealed a large group of genes highly up-regulated across tissues in EM, which were mainly implicated in innate antiviral responses and cellular stress. Despite equal levels of MHC class I in EM and LM, increase of splenic and cardiac expression of immunoglobulin-like genes was found only in LM while a suite of adaptive immunity markers were activated already in IM. The hepatic responses to ISAV were characterized by difference between EM and LM in expression of chaperones and genes involved in eicosanoid metabolism. To develop classification of high and low resistance phenotypes based on a small number of genes, we processed results from qPCR analyses of liver using a linear discriminant analysis. Four genes (5-lipoxygenase activating protein, cytochrome P450 2K4-1, galectin-9 and annexin A1) were sufficient for correct assignment of individuals to EM, LM and uninfected groups, while IM was inseparable from EM. Three of four prognostic markers are involved in metabolism of inflammatory regulators. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the understanding of molecular determinants for resistance to acute ISAV infection. The most susceptible individuals were characterized by high viral replication and dramatic activation of innate immune responses, which did not provide protection. The ability to endure high levels of infection for sustained periods could be associated with lower inflammatory responses while subsequent protection and viral clearance was most likely conferred by activation of adaptive immunity.","publish_time":"2008-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00F8rgensen, Sven Martin; Afanasyev, Sergey; Krasnov, Aleksei","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f080c95434a5112c5e2da4e3f93131fed6207fe7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2387173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18423000/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-179","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISAV","ISAV Glesvaer","IM","MHC"],"locations":["Atlantic"],"keyphrases":["LM fish","acute ISAV infection","ISAV Glesvaer","pathogenic ISAV","high levels of infection","Gene expression analyses","expression of chaperones","hepatic responses","high viral replication","lower inflammatory responses","innate antiviral responses","small number of genes","large group of genes","global gene expression","qPCR analyses of liver","salmon aquaculture","dramatic activation of innate immune responses","viral clearance","classification of high","Viral loads","susceptible individuals","cardiac expression of immunoglobulin","RESULTS","activation of adaptive immunity","days post-infection","Tissues","time course","suite of adaptive immunity markers","infected Atlantic salmon","low resistance phenotypes","correct assignment of individuals","metabolism of inflammatory regulators","Infectious salmon anemia virus","real-time qPCR","disease control","subsequent protection","equal levels of MHC class","salmonid fish cDNA microarray","eicosanoid metabolism","prognostic markers","cumulative mortality","multisystemic disease responsible","understanding of molecular determinants","Better understanding of factors","SFA2","severe losses","spleen","families","cohabitation","variations","development of strategies","sustained periods","uninfected groups","galectin","cytochrome P450 2K4","lipoxygenase","protein","gill","heart","annexin A1","difference","BACKGROUND","linear discriminant analysis","isolate","cellular stress","microarrays","study","stages","experiment","ability","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The samples were obtained from 190 Norwegian dairy and beef herds. BoNoV was detected in 49.6% of the samples from 61.1% of the herds indicating that BoNoV is ubiquitous in Norway. The overall prevalence was not significantly different in diarrhoea and non-diarrhoea samples. Analyses of polymerase gene sequences revealed both genotype III/1 and III/2 with genotype III/2 (Newbury2-like) being the most prevalent. Detected capsid sequences were restricted to Newbury2-like and the chimeric Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK strain. The RNA polymerase genotypes of the circulating BoNoVs in Norway were predicted by melting temperature analysis. Additional data from a challenge experiment suggest that a high proportion of young calves are shedding low levels of BoNoV for a prolonged time after recovering from the associated diarrhoea. The findings may explain some of the discrepancies in detection rates from previous studies and explain why some studies have failed to detect significant prevalence differences between calves with and without diarrhoea. It may also shed new light on some epidemiological aspects of norovirus infections.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jor, Evert; Myrmel, Mette; Jonassen, Christine M.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ca3486a6b07fa58d3823232cd026be783dd1fe9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112832.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093410001254; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093410001254; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.03.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20381534/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green","RNA"],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["non-diarrhoea samples","associated diarrhoea","faecal samples","low levels of BoNoV","Norway","Newbury2","detection of genogroup","detection rates","high proportion of young calves","previous studies","Analyses of polymerase gene sequences","beef herds","overall prevalence","capsid sequences","RNA polymerase genotypes","significant prevalence differences","novel SYBR Green based real-time RT-PCR assay","challenge experiment","discrepancies","circulating BoNoVs","prolonged time","bovine noroviruses","epidemiological aspects of norovirus infections","Thirsk10","Norwegian dairy","new light","chimeric Bo","Additional data","UK strain","temperature analysis","findings"],"language":"en"},

For many years, AAVs have been considered as low immunogenic vectors due to their ability to induce long-term expression of non-self-proteins in contrast to what has been observed with other viral vectors, such as adenovirus, for which strong immune responses against the same transgene products were documented. The perceived low immunogenicity likely explains why the use of AAV vectors for vaccination was not seriously considered before the early 2000s. Indeed, while analyses conducted using a variety of transgenes and animal species slowly changed the vision of immunological properties of AAVs, an increasing number of studies were also performed in the field of vaccination. Even if the comparison with other modes of vaccination was not systemically performed, the analyses conducted so far in the field of active immunotherapy strongly suggest that AAVs possess some interesting features to be used as tools to produce an efficient and sustained antibody response. In addition, recent studies also highlighted the potential of AAVs for passive immunotherapy. This review summarizes the main studies conducted to evaluate the potential of AAV vectors for vaccination against infectious agents and discusses their advantages and drawbacks. Altogether, the variety of studies conducted in this field contributes to the understanding of the immunological properties of this versatile virus and to the definition of its possible future applications.","publish_time":"2014-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieto, Karen; Salvetti, Anna","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/639215bc06ff8518135073d907b7bf6a9089c1fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3896988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478774/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of vaccination","potential of AAV vectors","potential of AAVs","use of AAV vectors","viral vectors","variety of studies","low immunogenic vectors","gene transfer","vision of immunological properties of AAVs","recent studies","main studies","modes of vaccination","field of active immunotherapy","gene therapy applications","increasing number of studies","analyses","exceptional properties of efficiency","duration of transgene expression","versatile virus","transgene products","variety of transgenes","passive immunotherapy","adeno-associated virus","possible future applications","perceived low immunogenicity","long-term expression of non-self-proteins","ability","infectious agents","definition","adenovirus","scientist","level","strong immune responses","animal species","tools","contrast","sustained antibody response","advantages","interesting features","discovery","understanding","drawbacks","comparison","review","addition","years"],"language":"en"},

Besides being an adhesion molecule, particularly in binding ICAM-2 and ICAM-3, it is also crucial in recognizing several endogenous and exogenous antigens. Additionally, the intracellular domain of DC-SIGN includes molecular motifs, which enable the activation of signal transduction pathways involving Raf-1 and subsequent modulation of DC-maturation status, through direct modification of nuclear factor Nf-\u03BAB in DCs. Upon DC-SIGN engagement by mannose- or fucose-containing oligosaccharides, the latter leads to a tailored Toll-like receptor signalling, resulting in an altered DC-cytokine profile and skewing of Th1/Th2 responses.

We found that disease genes and embryo development genes are prone to connect with each other. Furthermore, diseases can be categorized into three groups according to the closeness with embryo development in gene overlapping, interacting pattern in PPI network and co-regulated by microRNAs or transcription factors. Embryo development high-related disease genes show their closeness with embryo development at least in three biological levels. But it is not for embryo development medium-related disease genes and embryo development low-related disease genes. We also found that embryo development high-related disease genes are more central than other disease genes in the human PPI network.

These viruses require proteolytic activation of surface envelope glycoproteins needed for entry, and cellular cathepsins have been shown to be involved in proteolysis of glycoproteins from these distinct virus families. Very little is currently known about the available proteases in bats. To determine whether the utilization of cathepsins by bat-borne viruses is related to the nature of proteases in their natural hosts, we examined proteolytic processing of several viral fusion proteins in cells derived from two fruit bat species, Pteropus alecto and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Our work shows that fruit bat cells have homologs of cathepsin and furin proteases capable of cleaving and activating both the cathepsin-dependent Hendra virus F and the furin-dependent parainfluenza virus 5 F proteins. Sequence analysis comparing Pteropus alecto furin and cathepsin L to proteases from other mammalian species showed a high degree of conservation; however significant amino acid variation occurs at the C-terminus of Pteropus alecto furin. Further analysis of furin-like proteases from fruit bats revealed that these proteases are catalytically active and resemble other mammalian furins in their response to a potent furin inhibitor. However, kinetic analysis suggests that differences may exist in the cellular localization of furin between different species. Collectively, these results indicate that the unusual role of cathepsin proteases in the life cycle of bat-borne viruses is not due to the lack of active furin-like proteases in these natural reservoir species; however, differences may exist between furin proteases present in fruit bats compared to furins in other mammalian species, and these differences may impact protease usage for viral glycoprotein processing.","publish_time":"2015-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Najjar, Farah; Lampe, Levi; Baker, Michelle L.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Dutch, Rebecca Ellis","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4e24eaf67301135a909892450e011eaaa27f780.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4338073.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25706132/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115736","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pteropus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["furin proteases present","analysis of furin","Pteropus alecto furin","furin proteases capable of cleaving","nature of proteases","available proteases","fruit bat species","mammalian species","furin-dependent parainfluenza virus","unusual role of cathepsin proteases","cellular localization of furin","lack of active furin","fruit bats","Bats of different species","potent furin inhibitor","fruit bat cells","differences","natural reservoir species","cathepsin-dependent Hendra virus F","homologs of cathepsin","Ebola virus","pathogenic viruses","mammalian furins","F proteins","proteolytic processing","life cycle of bat","distinct virus families","cellular cathepsins","Sequence analysis","kinetic analysis","viral fusion proteins","viral glycoprotein processing","major role","natural hosts","proteolysis of glycoproteins","utilization of cathepsins","proteolytic activation of surface envelope glycoproteins","transmission","high degree of conservation","SARS","significant amino acid variation","C-terminus","entry","emergence","protease usage","response","Rousettus aegyptiacus","coronavirus","work","henipaviruses","results"],"language":"en"},

To address this knowledge gap, we analysed the uncharacterized nsp12 of arteriviruses, which occupies the ORF1b position equivalent to that of the nidovirus 2\u2032-O-MTase (coronavirus nsp16). In our in-depth bioinformatics analysis of nsp12, the protein was confirmed to be family specific whilst having diverged much further than other nidovirus ORF1b-encoded proteins, including those of the family Coronaviridae. Only one invariant and several partially conserved, predominantly aromatic residues were identified in nsp12, which may adopt a structure with alternating \u03B1-helices and \u03B2-strands, an organization also found in known MTases. However, no statistically significant similarity was found between nsp12 and the twofold larger coronavirus nsp16, nor could we detect MTase activity in biochemical assays using recombinant equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp12. Our further analysis established that this subunit is essential for replication of this prototypic arterivirus. Using reverse genetics, we assessed the impact of 25 substitutions at 14 positions, yielding virus phenotypes ranging from WT-like to non-viable. Notably, replacement of the invariant phenylalanine 109 with tyrosine was lethal. We concluded that nsp12 plays an essential role during EAV replication, possibly by acting as a co-factor for another enzyme.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehmann, Kathleen C.; Hooghiemstra, Lisa; Gulyaeva, Anastasia; Samborskiy, Dmitry V.; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Snijder, Eric J.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Posthuma, Clara C.","journal":"Journal of General Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/faeb9fe9e13d4bb64069905a64c28e2e36adf6a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081073.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26041874/; https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.000209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-MTase","family Coronaviridae","uncharacterized nsp12 of arteriviruses","in-depth bioinformatics analysis of nsp12","conserved ORF1b","family Arteriviridae","family specific","MTase activity","EAV replication","coronavirus transcripts","arterivirus mRNAs","O-methyltransferase","known MTases","twofold larger coronavirus nsp16","nidovirus ORF1b-encoded proteins","cap structure of nidoviral mRNAs","ORF1b position equivalent","essential role","structural protein","invariant phenylalanine","prototypic arterivirus","candidate MTases","yielding virus phenotypes","recombinant equine arteritis virus","biochemical assays","WT","positions","alternating \u03B1-helices","\u03B2-strands","impact","substitutions","order Nidovirales","organization","methylation","tyrosine","families","terminal domain","subunit","aromatic residues","knowledge gap","co-factor","enzyme","reverse genetics","replacement","significant similarity"],"language":"en"},

Although studies have been conducted on the frequency and risk factors associated with CDV infection, there are no comprehensive data on the current epidemiological magnitude in the domestic dog population at regional and national levels. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study and included our results in a meta-analysis to summarize and combine available data on the frequency and potential risk factors associated with CDV infection. METHODS: For the cross-sectional study, biological samples from dogs suspected to have canine distemper (CD) were collected and screened for viral RNA. Briefly, the PRISMA protocol was used for the meta-analysis, and data analyses were performed using STATA IC 13.1 software. RESULTS: CDV RNA was detected in 34% (48/141) of dogs suspected to have CD. Following our meta-analysis, 53 studies were selected for a total of 11,527 dogs. Overall, the pooled frequency of CDV positivity based on molecular and serological results were 33% (95% CI: 23\u201343) and 46% (95% CI: 36\u201357), respectively. The pooled subgroup analyses of clinical signs, types of biological samples, diagnostic methods and dog lifestyle had a wide range of CDV positivity (range 8\u201375%). Free-ranging dogs (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.05\u20131.97), dogs \u003E24 months old (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.1\u20133) and unvaccinated dogs (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.26\u20136.77) were found to be positively associated with CDV infection. In contrast, dogs \u003C12 months old (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.20\u20130.64) and dogs with a complete anti-CDV vaccination (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05\u20130.59) had a negative association. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of CDV positivity associated with almost all the variables analyzed in dogs, it is necessary to immediately and continuously plan mitigation strategies to reduce the CDV prevalence, especially in determined endemic localities.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Costa, Vivaldo Gomes; Saivish, Marielena Vogel; Rodrigues, Roger Luiz; de Lima Silva, Rebeca Francielle; Moreli, Marcos L\u00E1zaro; Kr\u00FCger, Ricardo Henrique","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a2c1193b96d3e54da56f17d1060e236df5b0e38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6541297.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Canine"],"organizations":["CDV","PRISMA","CDV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CDV infection","CDV RNA","CDV prevalence","unvaccinated dogs","pooled frequency of CDV positivity","high frequency of CDV positivity","health of domestic dogs","wide range of CDV positivity","complete anti-CDV vaccination","meta-analysis","data analyses","comprehensive data","Canine morbillivirus","available data","canine distemper virus","cross-sectional study","serological results","months old","studies","domestic dog population","types of biological samples","potential risk factors","dog lifestyle","diagnostic methods","viral RNA","pooled subgroup analyses of clinical signs","current epidemiological magnitude","national levels","serious threat","STATA IC","BACKGROUND","mitigation strategies","wildlife","contrast","endemic localities","PRISMA protocol","software","CONCLUSION","total","variables","negative association"],"language":"en"},

Recent epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that they are associated with 80 to 85 % of acute attacks of asthma in children, both in mild exacerbations, and in more severe exacerbations leading to hospital admission. The respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza viruses are predominantly detected in infants, while rhinovirus and mycoplasma are the commonest viruses in children. The detailed mechanism of virus-induced exacerbations remains poorly understood, al though recent studies have provided evidence of increased activation of inflammatory cells in bronchial lavage. Allergic individuals, outside of periods of allergy, do not seem to have more virus-induced respiratory manifestations than nonallergic individuals. In contrast, rhinovirus infection may intensify both the immediate and late response to allergen challenge by increasing mast cell mediator release and recruitment of eosinophils in the lower airways. Human and animal studies suggest that local production of cytokines (IL4, IL8, RANTES, MIP-1a...) and the increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in asthmatic individuals, may play an important role for recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in the airways. One hypothesis, that remains to be demonstrated, would be that in the presence of Th2 predominance, as occurs in asthma, an excess of IL4 could inhibit the development of cytotoxic CD8, NK and Th1 activity, thereby resulting in decreased IFN production, more severe allergic inflammation and less efficient viral clearance.","publish_time":"1996-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00E9fabert, L.; De Blic, J.; Scheinmann, P.","journal":"Revue Fran\u00E7aise d\u0027Allergologie et d\u0027Immunologie Clinique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64e149b193f5172ac57417743168890b708129ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0335745796800657; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0335745796800657","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe exacerbations","recent studies","induced exacerbations","animal studies","children","respiratory manifestations","mild exacerbations","asthmatic individuals","nonallergic individuals","Recent epidemiologic studies","hypothesis","evidence of increased activation of inflammatory cells","important triggers of asthma exacerbation","Summary Respiratory viral infections","severe allergic inflammation","acute attacks of asthma","recruitment of eosinophils","important role","excess of IL4","parainfluenza viruses","commonest viruses","rhinovirus infection","lower airways","decreased IFN production","local production of cytokines","efficient viral clearance","detailed mechanism of virus","increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule","allergen challenge","mast cell mediator release","Th1 activity","development of cytotoxic CD8","NK","ICAM1","IL8","mycoplasma","late response","bronchial lavage","RANTES","infants","MIP","hospital admission","presence of Th2 predominance","periods of allergy","contrast"],"language":"en"},

However, non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are transcribed in mammalian cells, and the roles of many of these ncRNAs remain enigmas. Using next-generation sequencing, we performed a whole-transcriptome analysis of the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection across four founder mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross. We observed differential expression of approximately 500 annotated, long ncRNAs and 1,000 nonannotated genomic regions during infection. Moreover, studies of a subset of these ncRNAs and genomic regions showed the following. (i) Most were similarly regulated in response to influenza virus infection. (ii) They had distinctive kinetic expression profiles in type I interferon receptor and STAT1 knockout mice during SARS-CoV infection, including unique signatures of ncRNA expression associated with lethal infection. (iii) Over 40% were similarly regulated in vitro in response to both influenza virus infection and interferon treatment. These findings represent the first discovery of the widespread differential expression of long ncRNAs in response to virus infection and suggest that ncRNAs are involved in regulating the host response, including innate immunity.

A self-administered, voluntary questionnaire on attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of respiratory hygiene guidelines was distributed to the health care workers at the emergency department of the 2 hospital sites. Results Median objective compliance with respiratory hygiene measures of triage nurses was 22% (interquartile range [IQR], 11%-33%). Median perceived compliance of the health care workers was 68% (IQR, 61%-79%). Median actual knowledge score was 75% (IQR, 75%-100%). Overall, 91.9% of respondents believed that the mask was an effective preventive measure. The main obstacles toward mask wearing by the health care worker were \u201Ctendency to forget\u201D (37.8%) and \u201Cdiscomfort\u201D (35.1%). Conclusion The compliance rate at our institution is very low. We identified a few factors affecting adherence to respiratory hygiene measures that are of potential use in targeting groups and formulating recommendations.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martel, Julie; Bui-Xuan, Eva-Flore; Carreau, Anne-Marie; Carrier, Jean-Daniel; Larkin, \u00C9milie; Vlachos-Mayer, Helen; Dumas, Mario-Eddy","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fd8c0279b90aff9a5c6bf7e3c48c2250ddb9c05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115267.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665531200106X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665531200106X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22503134/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2011.12.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory hygiene of triage nurses","Background Low respiratory hygiene compliance","respiratory hygiene principles of emergency health care workers","respiratory hygiene measures of triage nurses","knowledge of respiratory hygiene guidelines","compliance rate","Median objective compliance","health care workers of emergency departments","Median perceived compliance","triage emergency nurses","spread of respiratory infections","anonymous observation of compliance","IQR","factors","mask","Median actual knowledge score","university hospital centers","training centers","hospital sites","potential use","perceptions","major concern","targeting groups","attitudes","formulating recommendations","voluntary questionnaire","institution","adherence","descriptive study","interquartile range","effective preventive measure","Conclusion","tendency","main obstacles","Methods","respondents","discomfort"],"language":"en"},

Bernard Vallat, director general of the OIE, made the statement, \u201CAs a result of globalisation and climate change we are currently facing an unprecedented worldwide impact of emerging and re-emerging animal diseases and zoonoses\u201D. He is not alone in this thinking, but are we facing an unprecedented impact of diseases and are globalisation and climate change the main driving forces? This paper examines some historical disease outbreaks and the factors that played a role in their emergence and compares these with recent emerging diseases. In doing so it highlights certain challenges that face livestock producers and decision makers today as they grapple with emerging diseases. One of the driving forces for the emergence of diseases is translocation of people and their livestock and this has often been coupled with invading armies or peoples, political unrest and a concurrent environment of socio-economic upheaval. Contact between wild animals, domestic animals and people is another driving force involving the interaction between na\u00EFve population groups that induces the emergence of new diseases. Pandemics are not new to human society and nor are many of the driving forces that caused them to occur in the past; what has changed is our increased knowledge and awareness of disease dynamics, allowing identification of challenges for the future and ways of addressing these. Modern farming practices often serve to amplify emerging infectious diseases and modern trade and transport mechanisms and routes have served to sometimes accelerate the spread of disease. How can we reduce the risks and should we only be worried about emerging infectious diseases or are emerging non-communicable diseases just as important in our modern society? This paper serves to explain some of the reasons for the emergence of diseases and to try and answer some of the pressing questions that confront livestock producers today.","publish_time":"2010-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gummow, B.","journal":"Livest Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a975461d98da20a4e7647bf822858cf107b69e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102749.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2010.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288869/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871141310000727; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141310000727","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bernard Vallat"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergence of diseases","emerging infectious diseases","recent emerging diseases","re-emerging diseases","emergence of new diseases","unprecedented impact of diseases","emerging non-communicable diseases","re-emerging animal diseases","unprecedented worldwide impact of emerging","main driving forces","livestock producers","modern society","significant impact","modern trade","spread of disease","climate change","paper","awareness of disease dynamics","historical disease outbreaks","Modern farming practices","domestic animals","wild animals","identification of challenges","translocation of people","result of globalisation","certain challenges","recent years","human society","political unrest","public health","global economies","transport mechanisms","na\u00EFve population groups","peoples","interaction","concurrent environment of socio-economic upheaval","OIE","director general","bioterrorism","invading armies","factors","increased knowledge","routes","Contact","pressing questions","decision makers","zoonoses","Bernard Vallat","topical subject","constant threat","future","Pandemics","answer","today\u0027s world","statement","ways","role","reasons","thinking","past","risks"],"language":"en"},

Expression of picornavirus proteins can specifically induce the machinery of autophagy, although the mechanisms by which the viruses employ autophagy appear to differ. Many picornaviruses up-regulate autophagy in order to promote viral replication while some members of the family also inhibit degradation by autolysosomes.

Although still largely confined to birds, more than 300 human cases resulting in deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization. These sporadic human cases result from direct transmission from infected birds; however, a sustained outbreak of HPAI H5N1 increases the potential for the emergence of a human pandemic strain. One approach to the containment of HPAI H5N1 is the development of vaccines for use in poultry. Currently, the majority of avian influenza vaccines for poultry are traditional whole-virus vaccines produced in eggs. Although highly efficacious, these vaccines are hindered by long production times, inflexibility in quickly altering antigenic composition, and limited breadth of protection. Newer vaccines with more efficient manufacturing processes, enhanced efficacy, and cross-protection against multiple strains would improve preparedness. Reverse genetics technology has provided one such method, and emerging gene-based vaccines offer another approach that reduces dependence on egg-based production and human exposure to pathogenic viruses. Gene-based vaccines also provide rapid manufacturing, enhanced precision and versatility, and the capacity to protect against a broad range of viral subtypes. Vectors for these vaccines include replication-defective viruses, bacterial vectors, and DNA. Here we review the features of gene-based vaccination that may facilitate the control of HPAI H5N1 in poultry, and highlight the development of a hemagglutinin-based multivalent DNA vaccine that confers protection in mice and chickens.","publish_time":"2009-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had an isolated lesion on the first positive CT were enrolled in this study. The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground-glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow-up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13% [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57% [32/46]) were found. Other \uFB01ndings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calci\uFB01cation or lymphadelopathy were not observed. The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45%). At 22-31 days, the lesions were completely absorbed only in 2 of 7 patients(28.57%). CONCLUSION: The typical early CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are ground-glass opacity, and located peripheral or subpleural location, and with supply pulmonary artery dilation. Reticulation was evident after the 2nd week and persisted in half of patients evaluated in 4 weeks after the onset. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whether the reticulation represents irreversible \uFB01brosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Qiongjie; Guan, Hanxiong; Sun, Ziyan; Huang, Lu; Chen, Chong; Ai, Tao; Pan, Yueying; Xia, Liming","journal":"Eur J Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94b766fcebbb949573887fc3c8f7f87adb13fd61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166310.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X20302060?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X20302060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387924/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lesions","ground-glass opacity","pneumonia","halo sign of ground glass","positive CT","half of patients","typical early CT features of COVID","higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation","follow-up CT images","previous CT scans","subpleural location","air bronchogram","consolidation","Reticulation","days","early imaging features","isolated lesion","interstitial thickening","symptoms onset","Long-term follow-up","HRCT","high-resolution computed tomography","intralobular interstitium","changing trend of coronavirus disease","sizes","attenuation","abnormalities","sites","development","CONCLUSION","solid nodule","\uFB01ndings","weeks","METHODS","Cavitation","calci\uFB01cation","lymphadelopathy","PURPOSE","irreversible \uFB01brosis","following parameters","MATERIALS","study","reticular patterns","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

An efficient, scaleable manufacturing process for griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is essential for particularly cost-sensitive products such as griffithsin -based topical microbicides for HIV-1 prevention in resource poor settings. Our previously published purification method used ceramic filtration followed by two chromatography steps, resulting in a protein recovery of 30%. Our objective was to develop a scalable purification method for griffithsin expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants that would increase yield, reduce production costs, and simplify manufacturing techniques. Considering the future need to transfer griffithsin manufacturing technology to resource poor areas, we chose to focus modifying the purification process, paying particular attention to introducing simple, low-cost, and scalable procedures such as use of temperature, pH, ion concentration, and filtration to enhance product recovery. RESULTS: We achieved \u003E99% pure griffithsin API by generating the initial green juice extract in pH 4 buffer, heating the extract to 55\u00B0C, incubating overnight with a bentonite MgCl(2) mixture, and final purification with Capto\u2122 multimodal chromatography. Griffithsin extracted with this protocol maintains activity comparable to griffithsin purified by the previously published method and we are able to recover a substantially higher yield: 88 \u00B1 5% of griffithsin from the initial extract. The method was scaled to produce gram quantities of griffithsin with high yields, low endotoxin levels, and low purification costs maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology developed to purify griffithsin introduces and develops multiple tools for purification of recombinant proteins from plants at an industrial scale. These tools allow for robust cost-effective production and purification of griffithsin. The methodology can be readily scaled to the bench top or industry and process components can be used for purification of additional proteins based on biophysical characteristics.","publish_time":"2015-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fuqua, Joshua L; Wanga, Valentine; Palmer, Kenneth E","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4349730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887919/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0120-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Griffithsin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purification of griffithsin","purification process","griffithsin manufacturing technology","pure griffithsin API","gram quantities of griffithsin","scalable purification method","published purification method","final purification","low purification costs","griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient","purification of recombinant proteins","purification of additional proteins","published method","initial extract","scaleable manufacturing process","manufacturing techniques","process components","production costs","methodology","initial green juice extract","resource poor settings","viral entry","ceramic filtration","chromatography steps","multiple tools","multimodal chromatography","scalable procedures","poor areas","higher yield","protein recovery","product recovery","low endotoxin levels","viral envelope glycoproteins","Nicotiana benthamiana plants","robust cost-effective production","binding clusters of oligomannose glycans","maturation processes","high yields","broad spectrum antiviral lectin","prevention","HIV","temperature","mixture","Capto","particular attention","buffer","cost-sensitive products","ion concentration","topical microbicides","future need","protocol","industrial scale","biophysical characteristics","activity comparable","bench","industry","BACKGROUND","bentonite MgCl","objective","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this review the potentiation of bradykinin actions in different systems by certain compounds will be reviewed. Despite many long years of experimental research and investigation the mechanisms of potentiating action remain not fully understood. One of the most contradictory findings are the distinct differences between the inhibition of the angiotensin I\u2010converting enzyme and the potentiation of the bradykinin induced smooth muscle reaction. Contradictory findings and hypothesized mechanisms in the literature are discussed in this review and in some cases compared to own results. Investigation of potentiating actions was extended from hypotension, smooth muscle reaction and cellular actions to activation of immunocompetent cells.

The aim of this study was to characterize the subset(s) of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) expanding during active celiac disease to provide insights into the mechanisms involved in their expansion. Methods: Flow-cytometric analysis of isolated IELs and/or immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections were performed in 51 celiac patients and 50 controls with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against T-cell and natural killer (NK) receptors. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to identify candidate stimuli for NK receptor expression. Results: In normal intestine, different proportions of IELs, which were mainly T cells, expressed the NK receptors CD94/NKG2, NKR-P1A, KIR2D/3D, NKp46, Pen5, or CD56. During the active phase of celiac disease, the frequency of CD94\u002B IELs, which were mostly \u03B1\u03B2 T cells, was conspicuously increased over controls. In contrast, the expression of other NK markers was not modified. Furthermore, expression of CD94 could be selectively induced in vitro by T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15, a cytokine produced by intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusions: The gut epithelium favors the development of T cells that express NK receptors. In active celiac disease, there is a specific and selective increase of IELs expressing CD94, the HLA-E\u2013specific NK receptor that may be related to T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15 secretion.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to screen specific polypeptides, which bind BEFV G(1) protein with high-affinity and inhibit BEFV replication. METHODS: The purified BEFV G(1) was coated and then reacted with the M13-based Ph.D.-7 phage random display library. The peptides for target binding were automated sequenced after four rounds of enrichment biopanning. The amino acid sequences of polypeptide displayed on positive clones were deduced and the affinity of positive polypeptides with BEFV G(1) was assayed by ELISA. Then the roles of specific G(1)-binding peptides in the context of BEFV infection were analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that 27 specific peptide ligands displaying 11 different amino acid sequences were obtained, and the T18 and T25 clone had a higher affinity to G(1) protein than the other clones. Then their antiviral roles of two phage clones (T25 and T18) showed that both phage polypeptide T25 and T18 exerted inhibition on BEFV replication compared to control group. Moreover, synthetic peptide based on T18 (HSIRYDF) and T25 (YSLRSDY) alone or combined use on BEFV replication showed that the synthetic peptides could effectively inhibit the formation of cytopathic plaque and significantly inhibit BEFV RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Two antiviral peptide ligands binding to bovine ephemeral fever virus G(1) protein from phage display peptide library were identified, which may provide a potential research tool for diagnostic reagents and novel antiviral agents.

Whether and how to target sub-national areas for vaccination campaigns continues to remain a question. We analyzed three metrics for prioritizing target areas: vaccination coverage, susceptible birth cohort, and the effective reproductive ratio (R(E)) in the context of the 2010 measles epidemic in Malawi. METHODS: Using case-based surveillance data from the 2010 measles outbreak in Malawi, we estimated vaccination coverage from the proportion of cases reporting with a history of prior vaccination at the district and health facility catchment scale. Health facility catchments were defined as the set of locations closer to a given health facility than to any other. We combined these estimates with regional birth rates to estimate the size of the annual susceptible birth cohort. We also estimated the effective reproductive ratio, R(E), at the health facility polygon scale based on the observed rate of exponential increase of the epidemic. We combined these estimates to identify spatial regions that would be of high priority for supplemental vaccination activities. RESULTS: The estimated vaccination coverage across all districts was 84%, but ranged from 61 to 99%. We found that 8 districts and 354 health facility catchments had estimated vaccination coverage below 80%. Areas that had highest birth cohort size were frequently large urban centers that had high vaccination coverage. The estimated R(E) ranged between 1 and 2.56. The ranking of districts and health facility catchments as priority areas varied depending on the measure used. CONCLUSIONS: Each metric for prioritization may result in discrete target areas for vaccination campaigns; thus, there are tradeoffs to choosing one metric over another. However, in some cases, certain areas may be prioritized by all three metrics. These areas should be treated with particular concern. Furthermore, the spatial scale at which each metric is calculated impacts the resulting prioritization and should also be considered when prioritizing areas for vaccination campaigns. These methods may be used to allocate effort for prophylactic campaigns or to prioritize response for outbreak response vaccination.","publish_time":"2018-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kundrick, Avery; Huang, Zhuojie; Carran, Spencer; Kagoli, Matthew; Grais, Rebecca Freeman; Hurtado, Northan; Ferrari, Matthew","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2a4078a4441df3a53a2d719375da1c57bd93346.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6003196.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902976/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5628-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malawi"],"keyphrases":["vaccination campaigns","estimated vaccination coverage","high vaccination coverage","global vaccination coverage","outbreak response vaccination","Health facility catchments","priority areas","history of prior vaccination","supplemental vaccination activities","certain areas","given health facility","prioritizing target areas","health facility polygon scale","health facility catchment scale","discrete target areas","estimated R","sub-national areas","highest birth cohort size","annual susceptible birth cohort","measles outbreak","prophylactic campaigns","measles epidemic","spatial scale","high priority","effective reproductive ratio","regional birth rates","ranking of districts","Malawi","estimates","METHODS","metrics","proportion of cases","spatial regions","resulting prioritization","case-based surveillance data","large urban centers","observed rate of exponential increase","set of locations closer","preventable causes of death","progress","children","effort","context","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","particular concern","tradeoffs","measure","question"],"language":"en"},

Despite the myriad of recent advances in the rapid and accurate detection of pathogens, large volume clinical samples with a low concentration of pathogens continue to present challenges for diagnosis and surveillance. We here report a simple and label-free approach via homobifunctional imidoesters (HIs) with a microfluidic platform (SLIM) to efficiently enrich and extract pathogens at low concentrations from clinical samples. The SLIM system consists of an assembled double microfluidic chip for streamlining large volume processing and HIs for capturing pathogens and isolating nucleic acids by both electrostatic and covalent interaction without a chaotropic detergent or bulky instruments. The SLIM system significantly increases the enrichment and extraction rate of pathogens (up to 80% at 10 CFU (colony forming unit) in a 1 mL volume within 50 min). We demonstrated its clinical utility in large sample volumes from 46 clinical specimens including environmental swabs, saliva, and blood plasma. The SLIM system showed higher sensitivity with these samples and could detect pathogens that were below the threshold of detection with other methods. Finally, by combining our SLIM approach with an isothermal optical sensor, pathogens could be detected at a very high sensitivity in blood plasma samples within 80 min via enrichment, extraction and detection steps. Our SLIM system thus provides a simple, reliable, cost-effective and ultrasensitive pathogen diagnosis platform for use with large volume clinical samples and would thus have significant utility for various infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Choong Eun; Koo, Bonhan; Lee, Eun Yeong; Kim, Ji Yeun; Kim, Sung-Han; Shin, Yong","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80401d73b27bd070498dc6ec8a05587e8c39d4d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653418/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566318302550; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566318302550","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SLIM system","large volume clinical samples","extract pathogens","SLIM approach","accurate detection of pathogens","clinical utility","low concentration of pathogens","extraction rate of pathogens","clinical specimens","large volume processing","blood plasma samples","large sample volumes","microfluidic platform","enrichment","detection steps","threshold of detection","ultrasensitive pathogen diagnosis platform","low concentrations","significant utility","high sensitivity","higher sensitivity","Abstract Diseases","label-free approach","various infectious diseases","assembled double microfluidic chip","death","result","covalent interaction","viruses","serious medical issues","bacteria","environmental swabs","saliva","chaotropic detergent","pathogenic microorganisms","isothermal optical sensor","homobifunctional imidoesters","nucleic acids","huge economic losses","myriad of recent advances","challenges","bulky instruments","unit","CFU","colony","surveillance","methods"],"language":"en"},

Our stochastic model includes arrival and discharge of patients, as well as the detection of the outbreak by screening events or due to symptoms being shown by infective patients. For each ventilation setting, we measure the infectious potential of a nosocomial outbreak in the hospital ward by means of a summary statistic: the number of infections occurred within the hospital ward until end or declaration of the outbreak. We analytically compute the distribution of this summary statistic, and carry out local and global sensitivity analysis in order to identify the particular characteristics of each ventilation regime with the largest impact on the epidemic spread. Our results show that ward ventilation can have a significant impact on the infection spread, especially under slow detection scenarios or in overoccupied wards, and that decreasing the infection risk for the whole hospital ward might increase the risk in specific areas of the health\u2010care facility. Moreover, the location of the initial infective individual and the protocol in place for outbreak declaration both form an interplay with ventilation of the ward.","publish_time":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez\u2010Garc\u00EDa, Mart\u00EDn; King, Marco\u2010Felipe; Noakes, Catherine J.","journal":"Risk Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc7d924053530c0856e59387595309b8b1ea918e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7bd930b9d1e7df14ab7f3e97fd56dafe3466ad91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6850612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6850612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ward ventilation","hospital ward","ventilation regime","ventilation rates","ventilation setting","nosocomial outbreak","outbreak declaration","deterministic zonal ventilation model","infection risk","order","infection of individuals","stochastic model","summary statistic","infective patients","epidemic spread","airborne distribution of infectious material","airborne transmission of nosocomial infections","Markovian multicompartment SIS model","infectious potential","largest impact","significant impact","number of infections","discharge of patients","parametric study","epidemic dynamics","slow detection scenarios","initial infective individual","protocol","health","specific areas","place","effect","operational factors","overoccupied wards","particular characteristics","global sensitivity analysis","symptoms","arrival","screening events","end","interplay","care facility","location","results","work"],"language":"en"},

Here, we analyse the effect of the P. aeruginosa fucose-binding lectin LecB on human keratinocytes and demonstrate that it triggers events in the host, upon binding to fucosylated residues on cell membrane receptors, which extend beyond its role as an adhesion molecule. We found that LecB associates with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and dampens its signalling, leading to the arrest of cell cycle. In addition, we describe a novel LecB-triggered mechanism to down-regulate host cell receptors by showing that LecB leads to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor internalisation and subsequent missorting towards intracellular endosomal compartments, without receptor activation. Overall, these data highlight that LecB is a multitask virulence factor that, through subversion of several host pathways, has a profound impact on keratinocyte proliferation and survival.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Landi, Alessia; Mari, Muriel; Kleiser, Svenja; Wolf, Tobias; Gretzmeier, Christine; Wilhelm, Isabel; Kiritsi, Dimitra; Th\u00FCnauer, Roland; Geiger, Roger; Nystr\u00F6m, Alexander; Reggiori, Fulvio; Claudinon, Julie; R\u00F6mer, Winfried","journal":"Life Sci Alliance","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6610246f9b5c9535a4ad4e96fa4bee87624cbc1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/082892d44934e61adfef5cd6d5867439e30b183b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6858607.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6858607/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LecB associates","host cell receptors","growth factor","aeruginosa fucose-binding lectin LecB","receptor internalisation","receptor activation","host pathways","novel LecB-triggered mechanism","cell membrane receptors","virulence factor","insulin","Lectins","glycan-binding proteins","arrest of cell cycle","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","tissue colonisation","tissue repair processes","intracellular endosomal compartments","subsequent missorting","profound impact","fucosylated residues","diverse strategies","human keratinocytes","preferred niches","catalytic activity","keratinocyte proliferation","survival","subversion","role","infection","epithelia","events","Wounded skin","adhesion molecule","nature","Numerous bacteria","effect","signalling","addition","data"],"language":"en"},

While past publications have looked at interdisciplinary competency training for collaboration, few have identified the factors and conditions that enable operational One Health. Through a scoping review of the literature, a multidisciplinary team of researchers analyzed peer-reviewed publications describing multisectoral collaborations around infectious disease-related health events. The review identified 12 factors that support successful One Health collaborations and a coordinated response to health events across three levels: two individual factors (education \u0026 training and prior experience \u0026 existing relationships), four organizational factors (organizational structures, culture, human resources and, communication), and six network factors (network structures, relationships, leadership, management, available \u0026 accessible resources, political environment). The researchers also identified the stage of collaboration during which these factors were most critical, further organizing into starting condition or process-based factors. The research found that publications on multisectoral collaboration for health events do not uniformly report on successes or challenges of collaboration and rarely identify outputs or outcomes of the collaborative process.

Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly generating datasets that are worth more than their component parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a trait-free approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise dissimilarities between countries\u2019 pathogen communities and pathogens\u2019 geographical distributions and uses these to predict country\u2013pathogen associations. We compare the success rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g. virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model is able to use the information on the existing country\u2013pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly well, suggesting the importance in considering information on co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.","publish_time":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dallas, Tad A.; Carlson, Colin J.; Poisot, Timoth\u00E9e","journal":"R Soc Open Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50060c2e6ca8d987f5865cb47751b2decb376a96.json; document_parses/pdf_json/58896883d4e8bbc1abd7da700604299a03292b71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6894608.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6894608/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogen network","single pathogen","outbreak events","pathogen type","pathogen outbreaks","pathogen associations","simple model","prediction of emergence events","countries\u2019 pathogen communities","information","global view","disease emergence","stochastic pandemic events","global disease surveillance","sudden global emergences","re-emergence potential","prediction-oriented work","global community of human infectious diseases","influenza pandemic","biogeography of pathogens","co-occurring pathogens","single location","function of time","existing country","simple predictors","basic network structure","trait-free approach","critical task","pathogens\u2019 geographical distributions","public health professionals","component parts","dissimilarities","training","number of years","epidemiologists","decade","virus","importance","datasets","predictive capacity","transmission mode","Advances","coarse data","success rates","vector","future"],"language":"en"},

Bovine pancreatic RNase A, bovine seminal BS-RNase, human pancreatic RNase 1, angiogenin (RNase 5), and amphibian onconase belong to the pancreatic type superfamily, while binase and barnase are in the bacterial RNase N1/T1 family. In physiological conditions, most RNases secreted in the extracellular space counteract the undesired effects of extracellular RNAs and become protective against infections. Instead, if they enter the cell, RNases can digest intracellular RNAs, becoming cytotoxic and having advantageous effects against malignant cells. Their biological activities have been investigated either in vitro, toward a number of different cancer cell lines, or in some cases in vivo to test their potential therapeutic use. However, immunogenicity or other undesired effects have sometimes been associated with their action. Nevertheless, the use of RNases in therapy remains an appealing strategy against some still incurable tumors, such as mesothelioma, melanoma, or pancreatic cancer. The RNase inhibitor (RI) present inside almost all cells is the most efficacious sentry to counteract the ribonucleolytic action against intracellular RNAs because it forms a tight, irreversible and enzymatically inactive complex with many monomeric RNases. Therefore, dimerization or multimerization could represent a useful strategy for RNases to exert a remarkable cytotoxic activity by evading the interaction with RI by steric hindrance. Indeed, the majority of the mentioned RNases can hetero-dimerize with antibody derivatives, or even homo-dimerize or multimerize, spontaneously or artificially. This can occur through weak interactions or upon introducing covalent bonds. Immuno-RNases, in particular, are fusion proteins representing promising drugs by combining high target specificity with easy delivery in tumors. The results concerning the biological features of many RNases reported in the literature are described and discussed in this review. Furthermore, the activities displayed by some RNases forming oligomeric complexes, the mechanisms driving toward these supramolecular structures, and the biological rebounds connected are analyzed. These aspects are offered with the perspective to suggest possible efficacious therapeutic applications for RNases oligomeric derivatives that could contemporarily lack, or strongly reduce, immunogenicity and other undesired side-effects.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gotte, Giovanni; Menegazzi, Marta","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2aa31ef3d9d80509a965846122911a3fc53f7a99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6901985.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6901985/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of RNases","mentioned RNases","monomeric RNases","Immuno-RNases","RNases oligomeric derivatives","Bovine pancreatic RNase","human pancreatic RNase","RNase inhibitor","bacterial RNase N1","pancreatic cancer","undesired effects of extracellular RNAs","bovine seminal BS-RNase","intracellular RNAs","biological activities","pancreatic type superfamily","advantageous effects","undesired side-effects","biological rebounds","biological features","immunogenicity","number of different cancer cell lines","potential therapeutic use","possible efficacious therapeutic applications","efficacious sentry","extracellular space","appealing strategy","incurable tumors","useful strategy","oligomeric complexes","antibody derivatives","malignant cells","ribonucleolytic action","large number of enzymes","remarkable cytotoxic activity","high target specificity","promising drugs","barnase","easy delivery","fusion proteins","perspective","inactive complex","binase","mechanisms","mesothelioma","amphibian onconase","supramolecular structures","cases","T1 family","melanoma","present","therapy","angiogenin","eukaryotic superfamilies","weak interactions","covalent bonds","multimerization","steric hindrance","infections","majority","dimerization","homo","results","physiological conditions","Ribonucleases","aspects","literature","review"],"language":"en"},

During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this posttranslational modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on virus replication remain obscure. Here, we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse-genetics system. A trans-complementing cell line stably producing NSP5 was used to generate and characterize several recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that an rRV lacking NSP5 was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to further interrogate the function of this posttranslational modification in the assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant strains exhibited impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines expressing either wild-type NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results indicate that NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional viral factories in other RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE The rotavirus (RV) double-stranded RNA genome is replicated and packaged into virus progeny in cytoplasmic structures termed viroplasms. The nonstructural protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse-genetics (RG) system for rotaviruses. Here, we show a novel application of a recently developed RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants, we shed light on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent viroplasms.","publish_time":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papa, Guido; Venditti, Luca; Arnoldi, Francesca; Schraner, Elisabeth M.; Potgieter, Christiaan; Borodavka, Alexander; Eichwald, Catherine; Burrone, Oscar R.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a6032614741732c373d0a939ce85785519c3fa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6912106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozcx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of NSP5","RV replication","impaired NSP5 phosphorylation","RV infection","nonstructural protein NSP5","wild-type NSP5","molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation","assembly of replication","formation of replication","complex NSP5 phosphorylation cascade","stable trans-complementing NSP5","selected NSP5 deletion mutants","formation of viroplasms","rotavirus replication","NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains","C-terminal tail of NSP5","competent viroplasms","impaired viral replication","recombinant RV mutants","maturation of replication","round-shaped viroplasms","assembly of round","pivotal role","competent viral factories","round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories","assembly of functional viral factories","key role","complex hyperphosphorylation process","viroplasm formation","recombinant rotaviruses","trans-complementing cell line","tractable reverse-genetics system","developed RG system","rRV mutant strains","virus progeny","number of mutants","posttranslational modification","mutations","MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines","virus-induced organelles","MA104 cells","cytoplasmic structures","RNA viruses","double-stranded RNA genome","light","advantage","replicates","ability","paradigm","impact","crucial step","involvement","rRVs","roles","novel application","single serine residue","direct evidence","IMPORTANCE","lack","results","approach"],"language":"en"},

In a recent randomized controlled trial (Dexmedetomidine for Sepsis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Randomized Evolution [DESIRE]), we demonstrated that dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced mortality risk among patients with severe sepsis. We performed this exploratory sub-analysis to examine the mechanism underlying improved survival in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine. METHODS: The DESIRE trial compared a sedation strategy with and without dexmedetomidine among 201 mechanically ventilated adult patients with sepsis across eight ICUs in Japan. In the present study, we included 104 patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of \u2265 23 (54 in the dexmedetomidine [DEX] group and 50 in the non-dexmedetomidine [non-DEX] group). Initially, we compared the changes in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores from the baseline within 6 days after randomization between groups. Subsequently, we evaluated the variables comprising the organ component of the SOFA score that showed relevant improvement in the initial comparison. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 71.0 \u00B1 14.1 years. There was no difference in the median APACHE II score between the two groups (29 [interquartile range (IQR), 25\u201331] vs. 30 [IQR, 25\u201333]; p = 0.35). The median SOFA score at the baseline was lower in the DEX group (9 [IQR, 7\u201311] vs. 11 [IQR, 9\u201313]; p = 0.01). While the renal SOFA subscore at the baseline was similar for both groups, it significantly decreased in the DEX group on day 4 (p = 0.02). During the first 6 days, the urinary output was not significantly different (p = 0.09), but serum creatinine levels were significantly lower (p = 0.04) in the DEX group.

A survey was conducted to assess the intensive care physicians\u2019 perception of the AMR situation in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). METHODS: Between May and July 2017, physicians working in European ICUs were invited to complete an online questionnaire hosted by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. The survey included 20 questions on hospital and ICU characteristics, frequency of infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and relevance of AMR in the respondent\u2019s ICU, management of antimicrobial treatment as well as the use of last-line antibiotics in the six months preceding the survey. For the analysis of regional differences, EU/EEA countries were grouped into the four sub-regions of Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Europe. RESULTS: Overall, 1062 responses from four European sub-regions were analysed. Infections with MDR bacteria in their ICU were rated as a major problem by 257 (24.2%), moderate problem by 360 (33.9%) and minor problem by 391 (36.8%) respondents. Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently encountered MDR bacteria followed by, in order of decreasing frequency, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Perception of the relevance of the AMR problem and the frequency of specific MDR bacteria varied by European sub-region. Bacteria resistant to all or almost all available antibiotics were encountered by 132 (12.4%) respondents. Many physicians reported not having access to specific last-line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of European ICU physicians perceiving AMR as a substantial problem in their ICU is high with variation by sub-region in line with epidemiological studies. The reports of bacteria resistant to almost all available antibiotics and the limited availability of last-line antibiotics in ICUs in the EU/EEA are of concern.","publish_time":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lepape, Alain; Jean, Astrid; De Waele, Jan; Friggeri, Arnaud; Savey, Anne; Vanhems, Philippe; Gustin, Marie Paule; Monnet, Dominique L.; Garnacho-Montero, Jos\u00E9; Kohlenberg, Anke","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5be75ae4e7f8c892abd8dc396b9dbd035772c84a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6941296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6941296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMR","EU/EEA","European Society of Intensive Care Medicine","ICU","MDR","European ICU"],"locations":["Southern"],"keyphrases":["European ICUs","reports of bacteria resistant","AMR problem","multidrug-resistant","line antibiotics","European sub-regions","percentage of European ICU physicians","carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae","European Union","encountered MDR bacteria","frequency of specific MDR bacteria","frequency of infections","relevance of AMR","available antibiotics","European Society of Intensive Care Medicine","vancomycin-resistant enterococci","carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa","AMR situation","ICU characteristics","respondent\u2019s ICU","generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae","European Economic Area","intensive care units","substantial problem","major problem","moderate problem","minor problem","survey","meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","intensive care physicians\u2019 perception","serious infections","bacterial infections","sub-regions of Eastern","treatment of patients","EEA countries","respondents","order of decreasing frequency","management of antimicrobial treatment","limited availability","Antimicrobial resistance","hospital","variation","analysis of regional differences","adequate therapeutic options","questions","epidemiological studies","responses","use","access","Western Europe","online questionnaire","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","months","concern","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Among them, ICIs are the most commonly used and intensively studied. Since 2011, these drugs have received marketing authorisation for melanoma, lung, bladder, renal, and head and neck cancers, with remarkable and long-lasting treatment response in some patients. The novel mechanism of action of ICIs, with immune and T cell activation, leads to unusual patterns of response on imaging, with the advent of so-called pseudoprogression being more pronounced and frequently observed when compared to other anticancer therapies. Pseudoprogression, described in about 2\u201310% of patients treated with ICIs, corresponds to an increase of tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions due to infiltration by activated T cells before the disease responds to therapy. To overcome the limitation of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) to assess these specific changes, new imaging criteria\u2014so-called immune-related response criteria and then immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)\u2014were proposed. The major modification involved the inclusion of the measurements of new target lesions into disease assessments and the need for a 4-week re-assessment to confirm or not confirm progression. The RECIST working group introduced the new concept of \u201Cunconfirmed progression\u201D, into the irRECIST. This paper reviews current immunotherapeutic approaches and summarises radiologic criteria to evaluate new patterns of response to immunotherapy.

Perceived organizational support (POS) is regarded as being central in understanding job-related attitudes, and it is important to enhance POS for nurses to maintain their current employment. NPPB can further reduce nurses\u2019 job burnout and turn-over intention. Many studies have explored the relationships among general self-efficacy, POS, nursing practice environment (NPE) and NPPB. However, a moderating effect of NPE has not been fully explored in nurses, especially among paediatric nurses. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2018 with 300 paediatric nurses from 3 Class A tertiary hospitals in Jilin Province. The respondents completed the General Self-Efficacy Scale, Perceived Organizational Support Scale, Practice Environment Scale and Nurses\u2019 Perceived Professional Benefits Scale. The data were analyzed using path analysis and SPSS (version 23.0, IBM). RESULTS: General self-efficacy and POS were significantly positively associated with NPPB, which showed that the model had a good fit to the data. NPE was found to play a partial mediating role between POS and NPPB and also had a complete mediating role between general self-efficacy and NPPB. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that general self-efficacy indirectly influences NPPB, and POS directly and indirectly influences NPPB by NPE.

METHODS: Design: Descriptive analysis of CRE HAIs and retrospective observational cohort study using national HAI surveillance data. Setting: Egyptian hospitals participating in the HAI surveillance system. The patient population included patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in participating hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases were Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter isolates from blood, urine, wound or respiratory specimen collected on or after day 3 of ICU admission. CRE HAI cases were those resistant to at least one carbapenem. For CRE HAI cases reported during 2011\u20132017, a hospital-level and patient-level analysis were conducted using only the first CRE isolate by pathogen and specimen type for each patient. For facility, microbiology, and clinical characteristics, frequencies and means were calculated among CRE HAI cases and compared with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases through univariate and multivariate logistic regression using STATA 13. RESULTS: There were 1598 Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases, of which 871 (54.1%) were carbapenem resistant. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that carbapenem resistance was associated with specimen type, pathogen, location prior to admission, and length of ICU stay. Between 2011 and 2017, there was an increase in the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases due to CRE (p-value = 0.003) and the incidence of CRE HAIs (p-value = 0.09).

One aspect of care that has potential to affect all of the above is postoperative mechanical ventilation. Historically, postoperative ventilation was considered a must for maintaining patient stability. Ironically, it is recognized that mechanical ventilation may increase risk of adverse outcomes in the postoperative period. Hence, many institutions have advocated for immediate extubation or early extubation after many congenital heart surgeries which was first reported decades ago. METHODS: 637 consecutive patient charts were reviewed for pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were placed into three groups. Those that were extubated in the operating room (OR) at the conclusion of surgery (Immediate Extubation or IE), those that were extubated within six hours of admission to the ICU (Early Extubation or EE) and those that were extubated sometime after six hours (Delayed Extubation or DE). Multiple variables were then recorded to see which factors correlated with successful Immediate or Early Extubation. RESULTS: Overall, 338 patients (53.1%) had IE), 273 (42.8%) had DE while only 26 patients (4.1%) had EE. The median age was 1174 days for the IE patients, 39 days for the DE patients, whereas 194 days for EE patients (p \u003C 0.001). Weight and length were also significantly different in at least one extubation group from the other two (p \u003C 0.001). The median ICU LOS was 3 and 4 days for IE and EE patients respectively, whereas it was 9.5 days for DE patients (p \u003C 0.001). DE group had a significant longer median anesthesia time and cardiopulmonary bypass time than the other two extubation groups (p \u003E 63,826.88 \u003C 0.001). Regional low flow perfusion, deep hypothermia, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, redo sternotomy, use of other sedatives, furosemide, epinephrine, vasopressin, open chest, cardiopulmonary support, pulmonary edema, syndrome, as well as difficult intubation were significantly associated with delayed extubation (IE, EE or DE). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and early extubation was significantly associated with several factors, including patient age and size, duration of CPB, use of certain anesthetic drugs, and the amount of blood loss and blood replacement. IE can be successfully accomplished in a majority of pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, including in a minority of infants.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tirotta, Christopher F.; Alcos, Stephen; Lagueruela, Richard G.; Salyakina, Daria; Wang, Weize; Hughes, Jessica; Irizarry, Marysory; Burke, Redmond P.","journal":"J Cardiothorac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73b9d1b4a34bcb7e716d2dfeedd4c557cba87203.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6945478.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzExOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","EE","DE","ICU LOS","CPB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EE patients","early extubation","immediate extubation","Delayed Extubation","extubation groups","days","majority of pediatric patients","postoperative ventilation","postoperative mechanical ventilation","cardiac surgery","median age","patient age","cardiopulmonary bypass time","cardiopulmonary support","pediatric cardiac anesthesiology","median anesthesia time","conclusion of surgery","median ICU LOS","factors","patient stability","postoperative period","congenital heart surgeries","congenital heart disease","consecutive patient charts","deep hypothermia","blood loss","blood replacement","aspect of care","hours of admission","health care resources","deep hypothermic circulatory arrest","vasopressin","open chest","redo sternotomy","syndrome","Regional low flow perfusion","pulmonary edema","duration of CPB","optimal functional status","risk of adverse outcomes","morbidity","sedatives","epinephrine","increased focus","size","furosemide","certain anesthetic drugs","reported decades","difficult intubation","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Weight","length","minority of infants","potential","institutions","operating room","Multiple variables","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the KH virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination.

We aimed to determine whether a 3-h extended infusion (EI) of meropenem achieves fT \u003E MIC \u003E 40 on the first and third days of therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. We also simulated the performance of the EI with respect to other pharmacokinetic (PK) targets such as fT \u003E 4 \u00D7 MIC \u003E 40, fT \u003E MIC = 100, and fT \u003E 4 \u00D7 MIC = 100. METHODS: Arterial blood samples of 25 adults with severe sepsis or septic shock receiving meropenem 1000 mg as a 3-h EI eight hourly (Q8H) were obtained at various intervals during and after the first and seventh doses. Plasma meropenem concentrations were determined using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay, followed by modeling and simulation of PK data. European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) definitions of MIC breakpoints for sensitive and resistant Gram-negative bacteria were used. RESULTS: A 3-h EI of meropenem 1000 mg Q8H achieved fT \u003E 2 \u00B5g/mL \u003E 40 on the first and third days, providing activity against sensitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, it failed to achieve fT \u003E 4 \u00B5g/mL \u003E 40 to provide activity against strains susceptible to increased exposure in 33.3 and 39.1% patients on the first and the third days, respectively. Modeling and simulation showed that a bolus dose of 500 mg followed by 3-h EI of meropenem 1500 mg Q8H will achieve this target. A bolus of 500 mg followed by an infusion of 2000 mg would be required to achieve fT \u003E 8 \u00B5g \u003E 40. Targets of fT \u003E 4 \u00B5g/mL = 100 and fT \u003E 8 \u00B5g/mL = 100 may be achievable in two-thirds of patients by increasing the frequency of dosing to six hourly (Q6H). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, EI of 1000 mg of meropenem over 3 h administered Q8H is inadequate to provide activity (fT \u003E 4 \u00B5g/mL \u003E 40) against strains susceptible to increased exposure, which requires a bolus of 500 mg followed by EI of 1500 mg Q8H. While fT \u003E 8 \u00B5g/mL \u003E 40 require escalation of EI dose, fT \u003E 4 \u00B5g/mL = 100 and fT \u003E 8 \u00B5g/mL = 100 require escalation of both EI dose and frequency.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kothekar, Amol T.; Divatia, Jigeeshu Vasishtha; Myatra, Sheila Nainan; Patil, Anand; Nookala Krishnamurthy, Manjunath; Maheshwarappa, Harish Mallapura; Siddiqui, Suhail Sarwar; Gurjar, Murari; Biswas, Sanjay; Gota, Vikram","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c90ef565490d874214dfdf594ec8e3d5902fef4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6954163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Acinetobacter"],"organizations":["MIC","PK","European Committee","Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u00B5g","Targets of fT","h EI of meropenem","Q8H","escalation of EI dose","Plasma meropenem concentrations","severe sepsis","septic shock","definitions of MIC breakpoints","bolus dose","Optimal anti-bacterial activity of meropenem","h extended infusion","thirds of patients","strains susceptible","sensitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae","modeling","plasma concentration","frequency of dosing","exposure","hourly","days of therapy","simulation of PK data","dosing interval","minimum inhibitory concentration","EUCAST","adults","maintenance","Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing","reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Cp","Arterial blood samples","resistant Gram-negative bacteria","European Committee","Acinetobacter baumannii","BACKGROUND","respect","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Q6H","various intervals","pathogen","RESULTS","doses"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present the anesthetic management of a patient with a continuous-flow LVAD who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old man with LVAD was scheduled to undergo VATS because of repeated spontaneous pneumothorax. Generally, patients with these devices have marginal right heart function; therefore, it is important to avoid factors that worsen pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). However, VATS requires one-lung ventilation (OLV) and it tends to cause increase in PVR, leading to right heart failure. In the present case, when the patient was set in a lateral decubitus position and progressive hypoxia was observed during OLV, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle and a temporally flattened interventricular septum, and the central venous pressure increased to approximately 20 mmHg. Because we anticipated deterioration of right heart function, dobutamine and milrinone were administered and/or respirator settings were changed to decrease PVR for maintaining LVAD performance. Finally, resection of a bulla was completed, and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 37. CONCLUSIONS: The anesthetic management of a patient with LVAD during VATS is challenging because the possible hemodynamic changes induced by hypoxia associated with OLV affect LVAD performance and right heart function. In our experience, VATS that requires OLV will be well tolerated in a patient with LVAD with preserved right heart function, and a multidisciplinary approach to maintain right heart function will be needed.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iwata, Shihoko; Yokokawa, Sumire; Sato, Mihoshi; Ozaki, Makoto","journal":"BMC Anesthesiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51c7d48d7c1261556d5a7dd31871a105df7402de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6972011.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972011/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LVAD","PVR","OLV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VATS","marginal right heart function","preserved right heart function","deterioration of right heart function","right heart failure","LVAD performance","OLV","patient population","dilated right ventricle","continuous-flow LVAD","PVR","patients","anesthetic management","present case","progressive hypoxia","thoracic surgery","CASE PRESENTATION","incidence of noncardiac surgery","multidisciplinary approach","video","left ventricular assist device","transesophageal echocardiography","interventricular septum","expected survival","milrinone","dobutamine","devices","lateral decubitus position","central venous pressure","pulmonary vascular resistance","factors","stable condition","possible hemodynamic changes","year-old man","postoperative day","BACKGROUND","repeated spontaneous pneumothorax","lung ventilation","respirator settings","mmHg","CONCLUSIONS","bulla","experience","increase","resection"],"language":"en"},

While world health organization recommends HIV exposed infants to be tested between 4 to 6 weeks of age, in developing countries like Ethiopia, access to timely infant testing is still very limited. The study is intended to assess timely infant testing, testing for HIV at the 18th month, test results and factors influencing HIV positivity among infants born to HIV positive mothers in public hospitals of Mekelle, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed on 558 HIV exposed infants, using consecutive sampling technique. A checklist was used to extract 4 years (January 2014\u2013December 2017) secondary data, collected from January\u2013April 2018. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20, and binary logistic regression model was used to examine the association of independent variables with the outcome variables. RESULTS: Timely infant testing for HIV accounted for 346(62.0%). Mothers who attended antenatal care (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.17, 6.55) and who were counselled on feeding options (AOR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.65) were strongly associated with timely infant testing.

Both require trade-offs between such policy goals as liberty, security, efficiency, and equity. In public health, however, decisions about who will approve, pay for, and deliver services are often accompanied by decisions on when and how to compel individual behaviour. Policy becomes complex because different stakeholders interpret evidence differently: stakeholders may assign different weights to policy goals and may even define the same goals differently. In the debate over mandatory annual influenza vaccination for health care workers, for example, proponents as well as opponents of mandatory vaccination may convey arguments in security terms. Those in favour of mandatory vaccination emphasize subclinical infections and duty of care (public security) while those opposed emphasize risk of adverse events (personal security). Proponents assert less worker absenteeism (efficiency) while opponents stress coercion and alternate personal infection control measures (liberty and individual rights/responsibilities).

Determining the place of mandatory influenza vaccination for health care workers thus demands reconciling policy trade-offs and clarifying the underlying disputes hidden in the language of the policy debate.","publish_time":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mah, Catherine L.","journal":"Can J Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/503720a53e5c63f6d99b150d92268eedb180dc9a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6975919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["policy goals","Policy decisions","policy debate","personal health services","public health services","personal security","public security","health care workers","opponents of mandatory vaccination","favour of mandatory vaccination","reconciling policy trade-offs","mandatory annual influenza vaccination","place of mandatory influenza vaccination","different stakeholders","security terms","duty of care","liberty","efficiency","proponents","different weights","individual rights","alternate personal infection control measures","individual behaviour","opponents stress coercion","subclinical infections","evidence","arguments","example","worker absenteeism","underlying disputes","risk of adverse events","language","responsibilities","equity"],"language":"en"},

Case reports indicate an association between infections with influenza A viruses and reduced reproductive performance, although it has been difficult to experimentally reproduce the clinical outcome of poor reproductive performance. The aim of the present longitudinal field study was to compare the reproductive performance parameters before and after the implementation of vaccination against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Therefore, farm-specific data of 137 sow herds in Germany, including 60,153 sows, as well as the clinical presentation of the infection were surveyed via questionnaire. Furthermore, average performance parameters (return to oestrus rate, abortion rate, stillbirth rate, number of piglets born alive per litter, preweaning mortality rate and number of piglets weaned per sow per year) were recorded for 6 months before vaccination and 6 months after completion of primary vaccination. RESULTS: In 79.8% of the farms, the clinical presentation of the infection was characterised by a reduced reproductive performance. These findings were confirmed by analysis of the performance parameters, which revealed a significant decline in the return to oestrus rate (p \u003C 0.001), abortion rate (p \u003C 0.001) and preweaning mortality rate (p = 0.023) and a significant increase of the number in piglets born alive (p = 0.001) and piglets weaned per sow per year (p \u003C 0.001) after immunisation. The stillbirth rate did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The present study represents the first attempt to demonstrate the association of influenza A virus infection, vaccination and the alteration in reproductive performance parameters, investigating a large number of cases. The results show that by vaccinating against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, an improvement in reproductive performance can be achieved in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Additionally, the large number of herds that were affected by poor reproductive performance after infection with the aforementioned virus confirms the assumption of an association between pandemic influenza A virus and reproductive losses.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gumbert, Sophie; Froehlich, Sebastian; Rieger, Anna; Stadler, Julia; Ritzmann, Mathias; Zoels, Susanne","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15148b1d919a726ef92a447a2c52cc1576bd1ffa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6977244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6977244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reproductive performance parameters","reduced reproductive performance","virus infection","sow herds","pandemic influenza","association of influenza","oestrus rate","abortion rate","stillbirth rate","Reproductive failure","reproductive losses","clinical outcome of poor reproductive performance","average performance parameters","number of piglets","pdm09 virus","preweaning mortality rate","large number of herds","aforementioned virus","clinical presentation","large number of cases","implementation of vaccination","clinical signs","return","H1N1","present study","months","viruses","completion of primary vaccination","year","RESULTS","significant decline","present longitudinal field study","significant increase","litter","alteration","infections","assumption","improvement","aim","farm-specific data","Germany","attempt","BACKGROUND","Case reports","pathogenesis","sows","analysis","studies","literature","CONCLUSION","farms","findings","immunisation","questionnaire"],"language":"en"},

However, the immunological effect of adjuvants on immune cells from cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy remains to be demonstrated. Different adjuvants currently used in cancer vaccine clinical trials were evaluated in the present study on immune cells from cancer patients before and after chemotherapy in an ex vivo setting. METHODS: PBMCs were obtained from 4 healthy volunteers and 23 patients affected by either colon (OMA) or lung cancer (OT). The effect of CpG, Poly I:C, Imiquimod and RNA-based adjuvant (RNAdjuvant(\u00AE)) was assessed using a multiparametric approach to analyze network dynamics of early immune responses. Evaluation of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression as well as the downstream effect on CD4(\u002B) T cell phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry; cytokine and chemokine production was evaluated by Bio-Plex ProTM. RESULTS: Treatment with RNAdjuvant(\u00AE) induced the strongest response in cancer patients in terms of activation of innate and adoptive immunity. Indeed, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression was found upregulated in circulating dendritic cells, which promoted a CD4(\u002B) T cell differentiation towards an effector phenotype. RNAdjuvant(\u00AE) was the only one to induce most of the cytokines/chemokines tested with a pronounced Th1 cytokine pattern. According to the different parameters evaluated in the study, no clear cut difference in immune response to adjuvants was observed between healthy subjects and cancer patients. Moreover, in the latter group, the chemotherapy treatment did not consistently correlate to a significant altered response in the different parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first analysis of immunological effects induced by adjuvants in cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy, who are enrolled in the currently ongoing cancer vaccine clinical trials. The results show that the RNAdjuvant(\u00AE) is a potent and Th1 driving adjuvant, compared to those tested in the present study. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that chemotherapy does not significantly impair the immune system, implying that cancer patients are likely to respond to a cancer vaccine even after a chemotherapy treatment.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mauriello, Angela; Manolio, Carmen; Cavalluzzo, Beatrice; Avallone, Antonio; Borrelli, Marco; Morabito, Alessandro; Iovine, Emanuele; Chambery, Angela; Russo, Rosita; Tornesello, Maria Lina; Buonaguro, Franco M.; Tagliamonte, Maria; Buonaguro, Luigi","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64178d817555e1c63de9ed6fc531ce2f81579bdc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6977281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6977281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancer patients","lung cancer","RNAdjuvant","HCC patients","chemotherapy treatment","immune cells","ongoing cancer vaccine clinical trials","Different adjuvants","present study","immune system","immunological effect of adjuvants","healthy subjects","different parameters","CD4","strongest response","HLA-DR expression","CD86","dendritic cells","healthy volunteers","downstream effect","effect of CpG","RNA-based adjuvant","Evaluation of CD80","RESULTS","network dynamics of early immune responses","T cell differentiation","T cell phenotyping","significant altered response","noncoding RNA","pronounced Th1 cytokine pattern","analysis of immunological effects","flow cytometry","terms of activation","chemokine production","clear cut difference","Imiquimod","OMA","RIG","Poly","chemokines","effector phenotype","CureVac","colon","multiparametric approach","adoptive immunity","Bio-Plex ProTM","agonist","PBMCs","novel TLR","cytokines","CONCLUSIONS","group","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Owing to the significant impact on public health and social stability, great attention has been received on the identification of influenza reassortment. METHODS: We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS: It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a novel method for the prediction of influenza reassortment. We hope this method could facilitate rapid reassortment detection and provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Rui; Zhou, Xinrui; Rashid, Shamima; Kwoh, Chee Keong","journal":"BMC Med Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdf37ab78e7c9468d298b8abf6c380fa9a4a7ba2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e34d21582f57a95e1ef6a7a304bb36ce4d813357.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6979075.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["HopPER"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prediction of influenza reassortment","identification of influenza reassortment","reassortment probabilities","reassortment history","HopPER","rapid reassortment detection","evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses","novel method","based Probability Estimation of Reassortment","Host-prediction","swine viruses","novel computational method","host tropism prediction","novel insights","incomplete genomes","state-of-the-art methods","analysis of evolutionary success of avian","public health","social stability","new features","RNA segments","mechanism","great attention","different years","significant impact","range of real","synthetic datasets","physicochemical properties of amino acids","effectiveness","single cell","study","BACKGROUND","major pandemics","century","experiments","CONCLUSIONS","candidate reassortants","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Titration curves of hyperimmune sera were included on assay plates, assay signals underwent 5-parameter regression, and inspection of the median and interquartile range (IQR) for the y-inflection point was used to determine assay precision. The medians and IQRs were similar for Surveys 1 and 2 for most antigens, while the IQRs increased for some antigens in Survey 3. Levey-Jennings charts for selected antigens provided a pass/fail criterion for each assay plate and, of 387 assay plates, 13 (3.4%) were repeated.

The magnitude of care variability in shock resuscitation, the confounding effects of disease severity and comorbidity, and the relative impact on sepsis survival are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual care variability and determine the differential effect of observed and predicted fluid resuscitation volumes on risk-adjusted hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective outcome analysis of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to intensive care units using the 2013 Premier Hospital Database (Premier, Inc.). Observed and predicted hospital mortality were evaluated by observed and predicted day 1 fluid administration, using the difference in predicted and observed outcomes to adjust for disease severity between groups. Both predictive models were validated using a second large administrative database (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and cost. RESULTS: Among 33,831 patients, observed hospital mortality was incrementally higher than predicted for each additional liter of day 1 fluid beginning at 7 L (40.9% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to patients that received expected (\u00B1 1.5 L predicted) day 1 fluid volumes, greater-than-expected fluid resuscitation was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality (52.3% vs. 45.0%, p \u003C 0.0001) among all patients with shock and among a subgroup of shock patients with comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration (47.1% vs. 41.5%, p \u003C 0.0001). However, in patients with shock but without such conditions, both greater-than-expected (57.5% vs. 49.2%, p \u003C 0.0001) and less-than-expected (52.1% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.037) day 1 fluid resuscitation were associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable day 1 fluid resuscitation was associated with a non-uniform impact on risk-adjusted hospital mortality among distinct subgroups of mechanically ventilated patients with shock. These findings support closer evaluation of fluid resuscitation strategies that include broadly applied fluid volume targets in the early phase of shock resuscitation.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mansoori, Jason N.; Linde-Zwirble, Walter; Hou, Peter C.; Havranek, Edward P.; Douglas, Ivor S.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/035dfa7f9d4f5e67fc692f6a061566613ef7350c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2b52a9a78f3ece1f7e95096707f9c8e2f93a43de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6986034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6986034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Truven Health Analytics Inc.","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expected fluid resuscitation","predicted fluid resuscitation volumes","predicted hospital mortality","fluid volumes","fluid administration","ventilated patients","subgroup of shock patients","predicted day","increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality","fluid volume targets","early phase of shock resuscitation","closer evaluation of fluid resuscitation strategies","Premier Hospital Database","comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration","variable day","additional liter of day","usual care variability","magnitude of care variability","intensive care units","relative impact","confounding effects of disease severity","Secondary outcomes","predictive models","non-uniform impact","large administrative database","distinct subgroups","duration of mechanical ventilation","comorbidity","optimal approach","differential effect","ICU length of stay","Truven Health Analytics","retrospective outcome analysis","significant controversy","findings","cost","sepsis survival","OBJECTIVE","difference","CONCLUSIONS","RATIONALE","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

They are the current World Health Organization critical priority pathogens for resistance, Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and discovery of new antibiotics. However, there is paucity of data on nosocomial infections (NIs) caused by such superbugs in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the magnitude and profile of nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections among patients hospitalized at Felegehiwot referral hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Felegehiwot referral hospital from April 1 to July 31, 2018. A total of 238 patients with blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site NIs were enrolled conveniently. Either blood, urine and wound swab specimens were collected and processed using standard bacteriological procedures. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were identified using standard bacteriological techniques and confirmed by automated Vitek2 Compact. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolates was performed using the disk diffusion technique. The results were interpreted as per the standard zone sizes of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.Chi-square test was done to determine associations among variables. P value \u003C 0.05 was considered statistical significant. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years. Overall,20(8.4%) of patients had nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections. The proportion of nosocomial MDR blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site infections were 13(8.9%), 5(8.3%) and 2 (6.3%), respectively. Patients with NI had lower mean age (24.9 years) (P = 0.035). All isolates of NIs were from patients with intravenous catheterization. The frequency of NI was 9(3.8%) for MDR A. baumannii and 11(4.6%) for MDR P.aeruginosa. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were 100% MDR. All isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were 100% resistant to ampicillin and piperacillin.A. baumannii isolates were 33.3 and 44.5% resistance against meropenem and ciprofloxacin, respectively while P.aeruginosa isolates revealed 36.4 and 45.5% resistance against ciprofloxacin and meropenem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Health care associated infections of MDR A.baumannii and P. aeruginosa are critical problems in the study area. Therefore, urgent focused interventions required to contain the spreading of MDR NIs.

Attempts to target the kidney Renin Angiotensin System using native ACE2 to treat kidney disease are hampered by its large molecular size, 100 kDa, which precludes its glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular uptake. Here, we show that both urine and kidney lysates are capable of digesting native ACE2 into shorter proteins of ~60\u201375 kDa and then demonstrate that they are enzymatically very active. We then truncated the native ACE2 by design from the C-terminus to generate two short recombinant (r)ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619AA). These two truncates have a molecular size of ~70 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence and as shown by Western blot. ACE2 enzyme activity, measured using a specific substrate, was higher than that of the native rACE2 (1-740 AA). When infused to mice with genetic ACE2 deficiency, a single i.v. injection of 1-619 resulted in detectable ACE2 activity in urine, whereas infusion of the native ACE2 did not. Moreover, ACE2 activity was recovered in harvested kidneys from ACE2-deficient mice infused with 1-619, but not in controls (23.1 \u00B1 4.3 RFU/\u00B5g creatinine/h and 1.96 \u00B1 0.73 RFU/\u00B5g protein/hr, respectively). In addition, the kidneys of ACE2-null mice infused with 1-619 studied ex vivo formed more Ang (1\u20137) from exogenous Ang II than those infused with vehicle (AUC 8555 \u00B1 1933 vs. 3439 \u00B1 753 ng/mL, respectively, p \u003C 0.05) further demonstrating the functional effect of increasing kidney ACE2 activity after the infusion of our short ACE2 1-619 variant. We conclude that our novel short recombinant ACE2 variants undergo glomerular filtration, which is associated with kidney uptake of enzymatically active proteins that can enhance the formation of Ang (1\u20137) from Ang II. These small ACE2 variants may offer a potentially useful approach to target kidney RAS overactivity to combat kidney injury.","publish_time":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wysocki, Jan; Schulze, Arndt; Batlle, Daniel","journal":"Biomolecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c56e3599cec6dd5161af736e9d9cbd0e58c86315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6995632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6995632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang","Ang II"],"organizations":["Renin Angiotensin System"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["short ACE2","kidneys of ACE2","ACE2 enzyme activity","detectable ACE2 activity","small ACE2 variants","ACE2-deficient mice","genetic ACE2 deficiency","capable of digesting native ACE2","functional effect of increasing kidney ACE2 activity","novel short recombinant ACE2 variants","kidney uptake","kidney lysates","kidney disease","kidney injury","kidney Renin Angiotensin System","native rACE2","kDa","target kidney RAS overactivity","formation of Ang","exogenous Ang","glomerular filtration","infusion","RFU","urine","null mice","active proteins","AA","large molecular size","harvested kidneys","shorter proteins","\u00B5g protein","\u00B5g creatinine","subsequent tubular uptake","useful approach","C-terminus","design","specific substrate","amino acid sequence","hr","injection","Western blot","studied ex","vehicle","addition","monocarboxypeptidase","AUC","controls"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we demonstrate synchronized biventricular (BiV) pacing in a leadless fashion by implementing miniaturized and wirelessly powered pacemakers. With their flexible form factors, two pacemakers were implanted epicardially on the right and left ventricles of a porcine model and were inductively powered at 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, respectively. The power consumption of these pacemakers is reduced to \u00B5W-level by a novel integrated circuit design, which considerably extends the maximum operating distance. Leadless BiV pacing is demonstrated for the first time in both open-chest and closed-chest porcine settings. The clinical outcomes associated with different interventricular delays are verified through electrophysiologic and hemodynamic responses. The closed-chest pacing only requires the external source power of 0.3 W and 0.8 W at 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz, respectively, which leads to specific absorption rates (SARs) 2\u20133 orders of magnitude lower than the safety regulation limit.

Accordingly, the present study applies machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy for this patient subset. METHODS: We randomly divided a total of 1571 adult patients who started CRRT for acute kidney injury into training (70%, n = 1094) and test (30%, n = 477) sets. The primary output consisted of the probability of mortality during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of several machine learning algorithms with that of the APACHE II, SOFA, and the new abbreviated mortality scoring system for acute kidney injury with CRRT (MOSAIC model) results. RESULTS: For the ICU mortality, the random forest model showed the highest AUC (0.784 [0.744\u20130.825]), and the artificial neural network and extreme gradient boost models demonstrated the next best results (0.776 [0.735\u20130.818]).

Using neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) could have additional benefits, including the use of lower sedative doses, improved patient\u2013ventilator interaction and shortened duration of mechanical ventilation. We designed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of keeping tidal volume (V(T)) at protective levels with NAVA and PSV in patients with ARDS. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized crossover trial in five ICUs from a university hospital in Brazil and included patients with ARDS transitioning from controlled ventilation to partial ventilatory support. NAVA and PSV were applied in random order, for 15 min each, followed by 3 h in NAVA. Flow, peak airway pressure (Paw) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were captured from the ventilator, and a software (Matlab, Mathworks, USA), automatically detected inspiratory efforts and calculated respiratory rate (RR) and V(T). Asynchrony events detection was based on waveform analysis. RESULTS: We randomized 20 patients, but the protocol was interrupted for five (25%) patients for whom we were unable to maintain V(T) below 6.5 mL/kg in PSV due to strong inspiratory efforts and for one patient for whom we could not detect EAdi signal. For the 14 patients who completed the protocol, V(T) was 5.8 \u00B1 1.1 mL/kg for NAVA and 5.6 \u00B1 1.0 mL/kg for PSV (p = 0.455) and there were no differences in RR (24 \u00B1 7 for NAVA and 23 \u00B1 7 for PSV, p = 0.661). Paw was greater in NAVA (21 \u00B1 3 cmH(2)O) than in PSV (19 \u00B1 3 cmH(2)O, p = 0.001). Most patients were under continuous sedation during the study. NAVA reduced triggering delay compared to PSV (p = 0.020) and the median asynchrony Index was 0.7% (0\u20132.7) in PSV and 0% (0\u20132.2) in NAVA (p = 0.6835). CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to keep V(T) in protective levels with NAVA and PSV for 75% of the patients. NAVA resulted in similar V(T), RR and Paw compared to PSV. Our findings suggest that partial ventilatory assistance with NAVA and PSV is feasible as a protective ventilation strategy in selected ARDS patients under continuous sedation.

RESULTS: We report bacterial inhibition by iron-oxide (nominally magnetite) nanoparticles (NPs) alone, having a mean hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 16 nm, as well as alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs. Alginate capping increased the average hydrodynamic diameter to ~ 230 nm. We also investigated alginate-capped iron-oxide NP-drug conjugates, with a practically unchanged hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 232 nm. Susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the NPs, NP-tobramycin conjugates, and tobramycin alone were determined in the PAO1 bacterial colonies. Investigations into susceptibility using the disk diffusion method were done after 3 days of biofilm growth and after 60 days of growth. MIC of all compounds of interest was determined after 60-days of growth, to ensure thorough establishment of biofilm colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Positive inhibition is reported for uncapped and alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs, and the corresponding MICs are presented. We report zero susceptibility to iron-oxide NPs capped with polyethylene glycol, suggesting that the capping agent plays a major role in enabling bactericidal ability in of the nanocomposite. Our findings suggest that the alginate-coated nanocomposites investigated in this study have the potential to overcome the bacterial biofilm barrier. Magnetic field application increases the action, likely via enhanced diffusion of the iron-oxide NPs and NP-drug conjugates through mucin and alginate barriers, which are characteristic of cystic-fibrosis respiratory infections. We demonstrate that iron-oxide NPs coated with alginate, as well as alginate-coated magnetite\u2013tobramycin conjugates inhibit P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation in established colonies. We have also determined that susceptibility to tobramycin decreases for longer culture times. However, susceptibility to the iron-oxide NP compounds did not demonstrate any comparable decrease with increasing culture time. These findings imply that iron-oxide NPs are promising lower-cost alternatives to silver NPs in antibacterial coatings, solutions, and drugs, as well as other applications in which microbial abolition or infestation prevention is sought.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Armijo, Leisha M.; Wawrzyniec, Stephen J.; Kopciuch, Michael; Brandt, Yekaterina I.; Rivera, Antonio C.; Withers, Nathan J.; Cook, Nathaniel C.; Huber, Dale L.; Monson, Todd C.; Smyth, Hugh D.

Through the lens of one funder (NIHR), our aims are to map the diversity of public health research, in terms of funding mechanisms, disciplinary contributions, and public health impacts, identify examples of impacts, and pathways to impact that existing reporting mechanisms may not otherwise have captured, and provide illustrations of how public health researchers perceive the generation of non-academic impact from their work. METHODS: A total of 1386 projects were identified as \u2018public health research\u2019 by the NIHR and listed in the NIHR Public Health Overview database (2000\u20132016). From these, a subset of 857 projects were matched as potentially having begun reporting impacts via an external data-gathering platform (Researchfish). Data on the 857 projects were analyzed quantitatively, and nine projects were selected to investigate further through semi-structured interviews with principal investigators. Two workshops took place to validate emerging and final findings and facilitate analysis. RESULTS: In addition to the NIHR School for Public Health Research and the NIHR Public Health Research Programme, 89% of projects contained in the NIHR Public Health Overview portfolio as \u2018public health research\u2019 are funded via other NIHR research programmes, suggesting significant diversity in disciplines contributing to public health research and outcomes. The pathways to impact observed in our in-depth case studies include contributing to debates on what constitutes appropriate evidence for national policy change, acknowledging local \u2018unintended\u2019 impacts, building trusted relationships with stakeholders across health and non-health sectors and actors, collaborating with local authorities, and using non-academic dissemination channels. CONCLUSIONS: Public health as a discipline contributes substantially to impact beyond academia. To support the diversity of these impacts, we need to recognise localized smaller-scale impacts, and the difference in types of evidence required for community and local authority-based impacts. This will also require building capacity and resources to enable impact to take place from public health research. Finally, support is required for engagement with local authorities and working with non-health sectors that contribute to health outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boulding, Harriet; Kamenetzky, Adam; Ghiga, Ioana; Ioppolo, Becky; Herrera, Facundo; Parks, Sarah; Manville, Catriona; Guthrie, Susan; Hinrichs-Krapels, Saba","journal":"BMC Med Res Methodol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/930d03ff2d988e108373453efb57b07eb819bee2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7031933.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","NIHR School for Public Health Research","NIHR Public Health Research Programme","NIHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health impacts","diversity of public health research","public health researchers","health outcomes","NIHR Public Health Research Programme","NIHR Public Health Overview portfolio","NIHR Public Health Overview database","non-health sectors","NIHR research programmes","projects","examples of impacts","NIHR School","local authority-based impacts","local authorities","pathways","localized smaller-scale impacts","generation of non-academic impact","place","significant diversity","existing reporting mechanisms","support","terms of funding mechanisms","appropriate evidence","types of evidence","external data","building capacity","non-academic dissemination channels","disciplinary contributions","stakeholders","community","national policy change","disciplines","actors","trusted relationships","debates","in-depth case studies","semi-structured interviews","principal investigators","final findings","difference","resources","addition","analysis","platform","Researchfish","funder","engagement","aims","CONCLUSIONS","illustrations","UK","workshops","METHODS","total","lens","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","academia","subset"],"language":"en"},

Proteins are major chromophores and targets for damage due to their abundance, but the role of proteins in inducing damage to bound DNA, and the effects on DNA-protein interactions is less well characterized. In E. coli (and other Gram-negative bacteria) the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP/CAP) regulates more than 500 genes. In this study we show that exposure of isolated dimeric CRP-cAMP to UV modifies specific Met, Trp, Tyr, and Pro side-chains, induces inter-protein Tyr63-Tyr41 cross-links, and decreases DNA binding via oxidation of Met114/Pro110 residues in close proximity at the CRP dimer interface. UV exposure also modifies DNA-bound cAMP-CRP, with this resulting in DNA cleavage at specific G/C residues within the sequence bound to CRP, but not at other G/C sites. Oxidation also increases CRP dissociation from DNA. The modifications at the CRP dimer interface, and the site-specific DNA strand cleavage are proposed to occur via oxidation of two species Met residues (Met114 and Met189, respectively) to reactive persulfoxides that damage neighbouring amino acids and DNA bases. These data suggest that modification to CRP, and bound DNA, contributes to UV sensitivity.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leinisch, Fabian; Mariotti, Michele; Andersen, Sofie Hagel; Lindemose, S\u00F8ren; H\u00E4gglund, Per; M\u00F8llegaard, Niels Erik; Davies, Michael J.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0751832e00db4f030f6c5b65d9fa231597822a22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7033146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["CRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bound DNA","DNA-bound cAMP-CRP","DNA cleavage","DNA binding","DNA bases","CRP dissociation","DNA-protein interactions","CRP dimer interface","site-specific DNA strand cleavage","UV exposure","exposure of isolated dimeric CRP-cAMP","C residues","oxidation of Met114","UV sensitivity","UV light","Pro110 residues","specific G","specific Met","inducing damage","cyclic AMP receptor protein","role of proteins","C sites","inter-protein Tyr63-Tyr41 cross-links","close proximity","neighbouring amino acids","Gram-negative bacteria","reactive persulfoxides","chains","targets","Met189","Trp","CAP","abundance","major chromophores","species","sequence","effects","sensitive bactericide","mechanism of action","modifications","coli","study","data","genes"],"language":"en"},

However, expression of recombinant rARU in E. coli using the standard vaccine production process was very low. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed that at restricted dissolved oxygen (DO) the numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 2.5-times lower than those expressed at unrestricted oxygen. Additionally, a 7.4-times smaller number of ribosome formation genes (needed for translation) were down-regulated as compared with unrestricted DO. Higher rARU expression at restricted DO was associated with up-regulation of 24 heat shock chaperones involved in protein folding and with the up-regulation of the global regulator RNA chaperone hfq. Cellular stress response leading to down-regulation of transcription, translation, and energy generating pathways at unrestricted DO were associated with lower rARU expression. Investigation of the C. difficile DNA sequence revealed the presence of cell wall binding profiles, which based on structural similarity prediction by BLASTp, can possibly interact with cellular proteins of E. coli such as the transcriptional repressor ulaR, and the ankyrins repeat proteins. At restricted DO, rARU mRNA was 5-fold higher and the protein expression 27-fold higher compared with unrestricted DO.

However, no study has assessed the prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality among PMV patients, not less than 21 days after surgery. This study analyzed the predictors of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV in intensive care units (ICUs) after surgery. METHODS: In this multicenter, respective cohort study, 124 patients who required PMV after surgery in the ICUs of five tertiary hospitals in Beijing between January 2007 and June 2016 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the duration of survival within 1 year. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified with a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive effect of the ProVent score was also validated. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients enrolled, the cumulative 1-year mortality was 74.2% (92/124).

In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1\u20137, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover, B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme.

Clinically, PCV2 often causes disease through coinfection with other bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus suis (S. suis), and especially the highly prevalent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2). The present study determined that continuous PCV2 infection in piglets down-regulates tight junction proteins (TJ) ZO-1 and occludin in the lungs. Swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) were used to explore the mechanisms and consequences of disruption of TJ, and an in vitro tracheal epithelial barrier model was established. Our results show that PCV2 infection in STEC decreases the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin and increases the permeability of the tracheal epithelial barrier, resulting in easier translocation of SS2. Moreover, Western blot analysis indicates that PCV2 infection activates the JNK/MAPK pathway. The disruption of TJ in SETC and increased permeability of the epithelial barrier induced by PCV2 could be alleviated by inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, which indicates that the JNK/MAPK pathway regulates the expression of ZO-1 and occludin during PCV2 infection. This study allows us to better understand the mechanisms of PCV2 coinfection with bacterial pathogens and provides new insight into controlling the occurrence of PCVAD.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Qing; Zhou, Hong; Lin, Huixing; Ma, Zhe; Fan, Hongjie","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d8f5a99758b9fd0a7677ef33e7ae088c77a3bfc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7047418.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7047418/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["STEC","JNK/MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["continuous PCV2 infection","mechanisms of PCV2 coinfection","occludin","tracheal epithelial barrier model","expression of ZO","disruption of TJ","Swine tracheal epithelial cells","bacterial pathogens","STEC","expression levels of ZO","MAPK pathway","Streptococcus suis","suis serotype","results","Porcine circovirus type","inhibition of JNK phosphorylation","increased permeability","primary pathogen of porcine circovirus-associated disease","occurrence of PCVAD","consequences of disruption","present study","easier translocation of SS2","piglets","tight junction proteins","new insight","SETC","Western blot analysis","significant economic losses","lungs"],"language":"en"},

Cost of health care is one of the factors preventing access to quality health services and universal health coverage. In Nepal, the majority of expenses related to newborn care are borne by the caregiver, regardless of socioeconomic status. We conducted a study to assess the out of pocket expenditure (OOPE) for sick newborn care in hospitals in Nepal. METHODS: This cross-sectional study of hospital care for newborns was conducted in 11 hospitals in Nepal and explored OOPE incurred by caregivers for sick newborn care. Data were collected from the caregivers of the sick newborn on the topics of cost of travel, accommodation, treatment (drugs, diagnosis) and documented on a sick newborn case record form. RESULTS: Data were collected from 814 caregivers. Cost of caregivers\u2019 stay accounted for more than 40% of the OOPE for sick newborn care, followed by cost of travel, and the baby\u2019s stay and treatment. The overall OOPE ranged from 13.6 to 226.1 US dollars (USD). The median OOPE was highest for preterm complications ($33.2 USD; CI 14.0\u2013226.1), followed by hyperbilirubinemia ($31.9 USD; CI 14.0\u201360.7), respiratory distress syndrome ($26.9 USD; 15.3\u2013121.5), neonatal sepsis ($ 25.8 USD; CI 13.6\u2013139.8) and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ($23.4 USD; CI 13.6\u201397.7). DISCUSSION FOR PRACTICE: In Nepal, OOPE for sick newborn care in hospitals varied by neonatal morbidity and duration of stay. The largest proportion of OOPE were for accommodation and travel. Affordable and accessible health care will substantially reduce the OOPE for sick newborn care in hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sunny, Avinash K.; Gurung, Rejina; Gurung, Abhishek; Basnet, Omkar; KC, Ashish","journal":"Matern Child Health J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3096b8df6af780f3ba23605bbe091223fedea235.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7048699.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7048699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OOPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sick newborn care","Cost of health care","USD","accessible health care","explored OOPE","median OOPE","overall OOPE","hospitals","Nepal","sick newborn case record form","cost of travel","largest proportion of OOPE","cross-sectional study of hospital care","high quality health services","topics of cost","Cost of caregivers\u2019","universal health coverage","accommodation","neonatal morbidity","neonatal sepsis","treatment","duration of stay","baby\u2019s stay","Data","preventable neonatal deaths","place","preterm complications","factors","newborns","middle-income countries","drugs","hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy","diagnosis","pocket expenditure","majority of expenses","respiratory distress syndrome","METHODS","BACKGROUND","PRACTICE","US dollars","socioeconomic status","DISCUSSION","hyperbilirubinemia","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burgess, Tristan L.; Tinker, M.

Current traditional vaccines came empirically with either vague or completely no knowledge of how they modulate our immune system. Even at the face of potential vaccine design advance, immune-related concerns (as seen with specific vulnerable populations, cases of emerging/re-emerging infectious disease, pathogens with complex lifecycle and antigenic variability, need for personalized vaccinations, and concerns for vaccines\u0027 immunological safety -specifically vaccine likelihood to trigger non-antigen-specific responses that may cause autoimmunity and vaccine allergy) are being raised. And these concerns have driven immunologists toward research for a better approach to vaccine design that will consider these challenges. Currently, immunoinformatics has paved the way for a better understanding of some infectious disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, immune system response and computational vaccinology. The importance of this immunoinformatics in the study of infectious diseases is diverse in terms of computational approaches used, but is united by common qualities related to host\u2013pathogen relationship. Bioinformatics methods are also used to assign functions to uncharacterized genes which can be targeted as a candidate in vaccine design and can be a better approach toward the inclusion of women that are pregnant into vaccine trials and programs.

Although some people infected with SARS CoV-2 have no symptoms, the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with most COVID-19 infections being not severe. The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat. More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient\u2019s condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no drug or vaccine for curing patients. It has been observed that people with challenged immunity are highly prone to SARS CoV-2 infection and least likely to recover. Also, older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19. We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities.

Etiology of EA COPD are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis). Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD, such as NO2, SO2, ozone or particulates (PM10 and PM2.5). In 30% the etiology remains unknown. Differential diagnoses of AE COPD include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. Presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. AE COPD treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. Systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic. Recommended dose is 0.5 mg/kg on short course (5\u20137 days). During hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed. The main interest in non-invasive ventilation is persistent hypercapnia despite optimal medical management. During ambulatory management or hospitalization, clinical assessment at 48\u201372 h is mandatory.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jouneau, St\u00E9phane; Brinchault, Graziella; Desrues, Beno\u00EEt","journal":"Journal Europ\u00E9en des Urgences et de R\u00E9animation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d27842f2883b8884d975fe744e1157bb727d6f9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211423815000036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211423815000036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus influenzae","or need","ozone or particulates","EA COPD","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenzae virus","Haemophilus influenzae","virus respiratoire syncytial","hospitalisation","AE COPD treatments consist","invasive ventilation is","cas de patient fragile","AE COPD include infectious pneumonia","During hospitalization","is mandatory","cas de persistance","traitement initial","insufficient home support or absence","increase in bronchodilators","insuffisance respiratoire aigu\u00EB","Recommended dose is","The main interest in","Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD","langue fran\u00E7aise defines acute exacerbation","as an increase in daily respiratory symptoms","exacerbation aigu\u00EB","pneumothorax","respiratory distress","coronavirus","SO2","Key points The Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 de pneumologie","rhinovirus","Streptococcus pneumoniae","signs","kin\u00E9sith\u00E9rapie respiratoire","PM10","Moraxella catarrhalis","traitement m\u00E9dical optimal","PM2","response to initial treatment","the etiology remains unknown","acute confusion but also fragile patients","such as NO2","langue fran\u00E7aise d\u00E9finie","acute heart failure","During ambulatory management","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","mainly infectious","antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent","pulmonary embolism","insuffisance cardiaque","be systematic","majoration des bronchodilatateurs","Points essentiels","treatment adjustment","pr\u00E9sence de signes","dose recommand\u00E9e","hypercapnia despite optimal medical management","bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive","absence de soutien familial","majoration des sympt\u00F4mes respiratoires","thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed","chest physiotherapy","shock","basically duration","oxygen supplementation","bacterial","domicile","clinical assessment at","ad\u00E9novirus","adenovirus","pollution particulaire","Differential diagnoses","pouss\u00E9es","ambulatoire","r\u00E9ponse","antibioth\u00E9rapie","choc","hypercapnie","severity","pneumopathies infectieuses","Systemic corticosteroids should","charge","polluants","gravit\u00E9","variations quotidiennes","embolies pulmonaires","d\u00E9faillance neurologique","pratique","diagnostics diff\u00E9rentiels","exacerbations","oxyg\u00E9noth\u00E9rapie","thromboprophylaxie","expectoration","Presences","prescription de cortico\u00EFdes syst\u00E9miques","short course","r\u00E9\u00E9valuation clinique","courte p\u00E9riode","jours","days","cause","exposition","modification th\u00E9rapeutique","dur\u00E9e"],"language":"fr"},

Multiplication of HRVs occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. To produce infection, HRVs must first attach to specific cellular receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes. The resulting molecular models are useful to address questions about receptor recognition, binding specificity, and mechanisms by which ICAM-1 induces virus uncoating.","publish_time":"2000-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bella, Jordi; Rossmann, Michael G","journal":"Pharm Acta Helv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f30e13db5c0039d644e92f457f597adc081b422a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172299.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031686599000564; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031686599000564","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICAM","Multiplication of HRVs","percent of HRVs immunogenic variants","combination of crystal structures of HRVs","receptor recognition","cytoplasm","HRV receptor","virus uncoating","receptor intercellular adhesion molecule","plasma membrane","host cell","viral RNA genome","positive RNA strand","cell surface glycoprotein","questions","small viruses","important etiologic agent of common colds","binding specificity","icosahedral protein shell","fragments","electron microscopy reconstructions","specific cellular receptors","processes","mechanisms","delivery","resulting molecular models","complexes","striking distance","inflammation response","conformational change","Human rhinoviruses","lipid bilayer","interaction","infection"],"language":"en"},

Much is known about disruption of chromatin-modifying enzymes in malignant disease, but knowledge of irregular epigenetics in immune-driven disorders is just emerging. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA or histone modifications, are indispensable for precise gene expression in diverse immune cell types. Thus a disruption of epigenetic landscapes likely has a large impact on immune homeostasis. Moreover, the low concordance rates for most autoimmune diseases suggest that epigenetics contribute to immune tolerance disturbance. Here we review the important role of epigenetics for initiation, maintenance, tolerance, and training of immune responses. We discuss evolving evidence that DNA/histone modifications and chromatin-modifying enzymes are altered in immune-based diseases. Furthermore, we explore the potential of small molecules targeting epigenetic machinery, some of which are already used in oncology, as a way to reset the immune response in disease.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, S.; Jeffrey, K.

However, studies on the role of these viruses in asthmatic patients in the interval between exacerbations are sparse. This study aimed to determine the presence of respiratory viruses, without symptoms of infection, in the airways of young asthmatics as compared to healthy controls. Material and Methods Patients 10\u201335 years of age with stable asthma and a group of healthy controls were analyzed regarding the presence of RNA from common respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates by PCR. Self-reported asthma control and quality of life, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), spirometry, and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were recorded. Blood samples were collected to assess IgE sensitisation and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels. Results In 354 patients with asthma and 108 healthy controls, human rhinovirus (HRV) was the only virus detected (4.5% of asthmatics vs. 0.9% of controls; p = 0.08). HRV\u002B asthma patients had a higher degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation (median 37.7 vs. 10.4 kUA/L, p = 0.04), and a tendency for higher levels of serum ECP (median 17.2 vs. 12.6 \u03BCg/L, p = 0.07), as compared to their HRV\u2212 counterparts. Conclusions Absence of symptoms of respiratory tract infection notwithstanding, HRV seems to be more prevalent in the airways of adolescents and young adults with asthma and a high degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation than in controls. The presence of HRV seems also to be related to systemic eosinophilic inflammation despite ongoing treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6hrmalm, L.; Malinovschi, A.; Wong, M.; Levinson, P.; Janson, C.; Broliden, K.; Alving, K.","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125923.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611116300580; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2016.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27215496/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611116300580","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","HRV","ECP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma patients","asthma exacerbations","presence of HRV","stable asthma","presence of respiratory viruses","group of healthy controls","common respiratory viruses","asthmatic patients","Methods Patients","higher degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation","respiratory tract infection","Self-reported asthma control","high degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation","symptoms of infection","airways of young asthmatics","presence of RNA","higher levels of serum ECP","Abstract Background Viral respiratory infections","young adults","airways of adolescents","Conclusions Absence of symptoms","quality of life","fraction of exhaled nitric oxide","spirometry","ongoing treatment","FeNO","eosinophil cationic protein","nasopharyngeal aspirates","systemic eosinophilic inflammation","years of age","interval","inhaled corticosteroids","human rhinovirus","tendency","role","PCR","bronchial responsiveness","methacholine","wheezing episodes","\u03BCg","kUA","Blood samples","studies","Material","Results","study","counterparts"],"language":"en"},

Virus isolation, hemagglutination and receptor-destroying enzyme activity showed that the buffalo coronavirus (BuCoV) is closely related to BCoV but possesses some different biological properties. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 3\u2032 end (9.6 kb) of the BuCoV RNA revealed a genomic organization typical of group 2 coronaviruses. Moreover, the genetic distance between BuCoV and BCoV was proven to be the same or even higher than the distance between other ruminant coronaviruses and BCoV.

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV.

The extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chain and the complex type of N-linked oligosaccharide chains also occurs during this processing.","publish_time":"1985-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Namazue, Junko; Campo-Vera, Harvey; Kitamura, Kenji; Okuno, Toshiomi; Yamanishi, Koichi","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c345d1919a688f4773fd1405f95014b7ceab5118.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682285901126; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682285901126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycoprotein of gp","processed form of gp","O-linked oligosaccharide","processing","complex type of N","linked oligosaccharide chains","linked oligosaccharides","N-acetylglucosaminidase H","glycoproteins","high-mannose type","extension of O","precursor form","Immunoprecipitation experiments","VZV-infected cells","varicella zoster virus","Abstract Monoclonal antibodies","Golgi apparatus","cell surface membrane","enzyme endo-\u03B2","pulse","presence of tunicamycin","glucosamine","monensin","molecular weights"],"language":"en"},

We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression. Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases. In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts. In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0 \u00B0C, 12 cities had average AH below 4 g/m3, and one city (Haikou) had the highest AH (14.05 g/m3). Those 17 cities with 50 and more cases accounted for 90.6% of all cases in our study. Each 1 \u00B0C increase in AT and DTR was related to the decline of daily confirmed case counts, and the corresponding pooled RRs were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), respectively. For AH, the association with COVID-19 case counts were statistically significant in lag 07 and lag 014. In addition, we found the all these associations increased with accumulated time duration up to 14 days. In conclusions, meteorological factors play an independent role in the COVID-19 transmission after controlling population migration. Local weather condition with low temperature, mild diurnal temperature range and low humidity likely favor the transmission.","publish_time":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jiangtao; Zhou, Ji; Yao, Jinxi; Zhang, Xiuxia; Li, Lanyu; Xu, Xiaocheng; He, Xiaotao; Wang, Bo; Fu, Shihua; Niu, Tingting; Yan, Jun; Shi, Yanjun; Ren, Xiaowei; Niu, Jingping; Zhu, Weihao; Li, Sheng; Luo, Bin; Zhang, Kai","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b51e0ba3a7aebd8bf8e18fc0d82384ebd135192a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194892.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972032026X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972032026X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSI","DTR"],"locations":["China","Northern China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases","decline of daily confirmed case counts","COVID","low temperature","average AH","associations","city-specific effects of meteorological factors","ambient temperature","highest AH","provincial capital cities of China","stage analysis","mild diurnal temperature range","low humidity","DTR","MSI","m3","pooled effects","transmission","lag","absolute humidity","daily dataset","population migration","Northern China","C increase","present study","meta-analysis","migration scale index","corresponding pooled RRs","linear models","negative binomial distribution","Local weather condition","independent role","accumulated time duration","novel coronavirus disease","Haikou","non-linear regression","days","conclusions","purpose","period","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

There were 5327 SARS cases from November 2002 to May 2003 in Mainland China, which involved 29 provinces, resulted in 349 deaths, and directly caused economic losses of $18.3 billion. METHODS: This study used an in-out flow model and flow mapping to visualize and explore the spatial pattern of SARS transmission in different regions. In-out flow is measured by the in-out degree and clustering coefficient of SARS. Flow mapping is an exploratory method of spatial visualization for interaction data. RESULTS: The findings were as follows. (1) SARS in-out flow had a clear hierarchy. It formed two main centers, Guangdong in South China and Beijing in North China, and two secondary centers, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, both connected to Beijing. (2) \u201CSpring Festival travel\u201D strengthened external flow, but \u201CSARS panic effect\u201D played a more significant role and pushed the external flow to the peak. (3) External flow and its three typical kinds showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, such as self-spreading flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases only within the province or municipality of onset and medical locations); hospitalized flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases that had been seen by a hospital doctor); and migrant flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases among migrant workers). (4) Internal and external flow tended to occur in younger groups, and occupational differentiation was particularly evident. Low-income groups of male migrants aged 19\u201335 years were the main routes of external flow. CONCLUSIONS: During 2002\u20132003, SARS in-out flow played an important role in countrywide transmission of the disease in Mainland China. The flow had obvious spatial heterogeneity, which was influenced by migrants\u2019 behavior characteristics. In addition, the Chinese holiday effect led to irregular spread of SARS, but the panic effect was more apparent in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. These findings constitute valuable input to prevent and control future serious infectious diseases like SARS.

Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 105 hospitalized ALRI cases and 53 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR, and RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. Results Respiratory viruses were more common among ALRI cases than controls (83.8% vs. 69.2%; p=0.041). RV was the most commonly identified virus in cases with pneumonia (45.6%) or bronchiolitis (52.1%), regardless of HIV status, as well as in controls (39.6%).

Abstract The \u201Ccommon cold\u201D or upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is a moderate inflammation of the upper respiratory tract mucosa extended from the nasal cavity to the larynx. The main symptoms are nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, pharyngeal pain, sneezing, and coughing. Acute URI is a viral infection. It usually heals without any complication, and does not require any bacteriological samples nor antibiotherapy. First-line treatment consists of analgesic and antipyretic drugs associated with normal or hypertonic saline nasal wash. The most frequent URI complications are infectious diseases, mainly otitis media, sinusitis, and upper airway obstruction. URI recurrences that are often observed after the age of 6 months reflect a physiological process of maturation of the immune system.

The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient\u0027s chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. RESULTS: CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean age was 44.9 \u00B1 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 \u00B1 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients had patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, 14 (22.2%) patients had GGO, 12 (19.0%) patients had patchy consolidation, 11 (17.5%) patients had fibrous stripes and 8 (12.7%) patients had irregular solid nodules. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients progressed, including single GGO increased, enlarged and consolidated; fibrous stripe enlarged, while solid nodules increased and enlarged. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging changes in novel viral pneumonia are rapid. The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse. Imaging changes of typical viral pneumonia and some specific imaging features were observed. Therefore, we need to strengthen the recognition of image changes to help clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately.

The main objective of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between RSV load and disease severity and also between different clinical markers and mRNA levels of the interferon stimulated gene (ISG)56 in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. We also evaluated whether viral load tended to be persistent over the course of the RSV infection. The levels of RSV-RNA were quantified in nasopharyngeal washings, collected from 132 infants infected with RSV as a single (90.15%) or as a dual infection with other respiratory viruses (9.85%). Results indicated that viral load was positively related to the clinical severity of bronchiolitis, the length of hospital stay, the levels of glycemia and the relative gene expression of ISG56, whereas an inverse correlation was observed with the levels of hemoglobin. We also found that the RSV load significantly decreased between the first and second nasopharingeal washings sample in most subjects. These results suggest that infants with high RSV load on hospital admission are more likely to have both more severe bronchiolitis and a higher airway activation of antiviral immune response.","publish_time":"2012-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scagnolari, Carolina; Midulla, Fabio; Selvaggi, Carla; Monteleone, Katia; Bonci, Enea; Papoff, Paola; Cangiano, Giulia; Marco, Paola Di; Moretti, Corrado; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Antonelli, Guido","journal":"Med Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df40b332d63d975f5c1fafc83809531da87294c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086883.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-012-0233-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of RSV","high RSV load","viral load","RSV infection","infants","clinical severity of bronchiolitis","disease severity","mRNA levels","levels of glycemia","levels of hemoglobin","severe bronchiolitis","associated bronchiolitis","antiviral immune activation","Results","higher airway activation of antiviral immune response","hospital admission","length of hospital","respiratory viruses","inverse correlation","nasopharyngeal washings","dual infection","interferon stimulated gene","different clinical markers","respiratory syncytial virus","nasopharingeal washings sample","relative gene expression of ISG56","existence","relationship","study","subjects","course","main objective"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera of 793 (325 CHB-M, 170 CHB-S, and 298 ACLF) patients admitted to or who had visited Beijing 302 Hospital from January 2005 to December 2008 were collected and successfully amplified for the HBV BCP/PC and a 1225-bp-long S/Pol (nt 54\u20131278) gene regions. Biochemical and serological parameters and HBV DNA level were routinely performed. Viral DNA was extracted and subjected to a nested PCR. Genotypes/subgenotypes were determined based on complete genomic sequence or on analysis of the 1225-bp-long S/Pol-gene sequence. HBV genotyping was performed by direct PCR sequencing followed by molecular evolutionary analysis of the viral sequences. A P value of \u003C0.05 (two-sided) was considered to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CHB patients infected with BCP/PC mutant viruses are more susceptible to severe hepatitis and ACLF than those with the BCP/PC wild-type virus and that ACLF patients with PC mutant viruses have an increased risk of death. As such, the HBV PC mutation is a potential predictive indicator of ACLF outcome.","publish_time":"2010-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Zhihui; Ren, Xiaoqiang; Liu, Yan; Li, Xiaodong; Bai, Siyu; Zhong, Yanwei; Wang, Lin; Mao, Panyong; Wang, Huifen; Xin, Shaojie; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Chan, Henry Lik-Yuen; Zoulim, Fabien; Xu, Dongping","journal":"J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3abdd1c1c8d9c5aec0c3f3447c0c11f0adf16a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088102.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20848146/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-010-0315-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCP/PC","S/Pol","HBV","PCR","CHB","HBV PC","ACLF"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["ACLF patients","CHB patients","HBV BCP","CHB-S","HBV PC mutation","PC mutant viruses","HBV genotyping","HBV DNA level","bp-long S","PC wild-type virus","severe hepatitis","severe chronic hepatitis B","features of hepatitis B virus","Pol-gene sequence","Viral DNA","potential predictive indicator of ACLF outcome","virologic features","viral sequences","nested PCR","gene regions","molecular evolutionary analysis","chronic liver failure","direct PCR sequencing","complete genomic sequence","basal core promoter","precore","large number of mild","mutations","serological parameters","clinical implications","increased risk of death","subgenotypes","Sera","findings","P value","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Beijing","Hospital","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Practitioners should recommend initial diagnostics, including radiographs and blood work on guinea pigs and rabbits presenting with nonspecific signs of gastrointestinal stasis, to better determine possible cause and make the best treatment recommendations.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeCubellis, Julie; Graham, Jennifer","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/221b85e6b222cb516945361fa0b04d0d6dc8f2ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128126.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094919413000030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094919413000030; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvex.2013.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23642870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Practitioners"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["guinea pigs","rabbits","recognized causes of gastrointestinal stasis","management of gastrointestinal diseases","nonspecific signs of gastrointestinal stasis","established causes of gastrointestinal disease","colonic entrapment","volvulus","lead toxicity","blood work","gastric dilation","radiographs","possible cause","article reviews diagnosis","initial diagnostics","liver torsion","best treatment recommendations","species","syndromes","Practitioners"],"language":"en"},

These viruses possess segmented, negative stranded RNA genomes (vRNA) and are enveloped, usually spherical and bud from the plasma membrane (more specifically, the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells). Complete virus particles, therefore, are not found inside infected cells. Virus particles consist of three major subviral components, namely the viral envelope, matrix protein (M1), and core (viral ribonucleocapsid [vRNP]). The viral envelope surrounding the vRNP consists of a lipid bilayer containing spikes composed of viral glycoproteins (HA, NA, and M2) on the outer side and M1 on the inner side. Viral lipids, derived from the host plasma membrane, are selectively enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. M1 forms the bridge between the viral envelope and the core. The viral core consists of helical vRNP containing vRNA (minus strand) and NP along with minor amounts of NEP and polymerase complex (PA, PB1, and PB2). For viral morphogenesis to occur, all three viral components, namely the viral envelope (containing lipids and transmembrane proteins), M1, and the vRNP must be brought to the assembly site, i.e. the apical plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells. Finally, buds must be formed at the assembly site and virus particles released with the closure of buds. Transmembrane viral proteins are transported to the assembly site on the plasma membrane via the exocytic pathway. Both HA and NA possess apical sorting signals and use lipid rafts for cell surface transport and apical sorting. These lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and are relatively resistant to neutral detergent extraction at low temperature. M1 is synthesized on free cytosolic polyribosomes. vRNPs are made inside the host nucleus and are exported into the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore with the help of M1 and NEP. How M1 and vRNPs are directed to the assembly site on the plasma membrane remains unclear. The likely possibilities are that they use a piggy-back mechanism on viral glycoproteins or cytoskeletal elements. Alternatively, they may possess apical determinants or diffuse to the assembly site, or a combination of these pathways. Interactions of M1 with M1, M1 with vRNP, and M1 with HA and NA facilitate concentration of viral components and exclusion of host proteins from the budding site. M1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail (CT) and transmembrane domain (TMD) of glycoproteins, and thereby functions as a bridge between the viral envelope and vRNP. Lipid rafts function as microdomains for concentrating viral glycoproteins and may serve as a platform for virus budding. Virus bud formation requires membrane bending at the budding site. A combination of factors including concentration of and interaction among viral components, increased viscosity and asymmetry of the lipid bilayer of the lipid raft as well as pulling and pushing forces of viral and host components are likely to cause outward curvature of the plasma membrane at the assembly site leading to bud formation. Eventually, virus release requires completion of the bud due to fusion of the apposing membranes, leading to the closure of the bud, separation of the virus particle from the host plasma membrane and release of the virus particle into the extracellular environment. Among the viral components, M1 contains an L domain motif and plays a critical role in budding. Bud completion requires not only viral components but also host components. However, how host components facilitate bud completion remains unclear. In addition to bud completion, influenza virus requires NA to release virus particles from sialic acid residues on the cell surface and spread from cell to cell. Elucidation of both viral and host factors involved in viral morphogenesis and budding may lead to the development of drugs interfering with the steps of viral morphogenesis and in disease progression.","publish_time":"2004-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nayak, Debi P.; Hui, Eric Ka-Wai; Barman, Subrata","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/409d4d8ba71218f302695b9f3f3878525adf6b82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172797.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170204003235; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170204003235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bud"],"organizations":["RNA","NP","NEP","NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral envelope","viral glycoproteins","viral core","Viral lipids","concentration of viral components","viral ribonucleocapsid","forces of viral","viral morphogenesis","Transmembrane viral proteins","host plasma membrane","host components","help of M1","assembly site","Interactions of M1","Virus bud formation","virus release","Bud completion","budding site","release virus particles","Complete virus particles","apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells","lipid bilayer","host nucleus","major subviral components","exclusion of host proteins","helical vRNP","Lipid rafts function","apical determinants","transmembrane proteins","apical sorting signals","Influenza viruses","transmembrane domain","cell surface transport","vRNA","cholesterol","infected cells","vRNPs","bridge","glycosphingolipids","closure of buds","domain motif","combination of factors","likely possibilities","sialic acid residues","causative agents","increased viscosity","polymerase complex","acute febrile respiratory disease","negative stranded RNA genomes","minor amounts of NEP","asymmetry","neutral detergent extraction","outward curvature","mechanism","microdomains","spikes","low temperature","cytoplasmic tail","matrix protein","PB1","critical role","nuclear pore","TMD","fusion","piggy","cytoskeletal elements","separation","addition","apposing membranes","free cytosolic polyribosomes","M2","extracellular environment","exocytic pathway","PB2","platform","Orthomyxoviridae family","pathways","steps of viral morphogenesis","host factors","budding","disease progression","development of drugs","Elucidation"],"language":"en"},

The quality of passive immune transfer (i.e. blood IgG concentration at two days of age), highly variable between litters and between puppies within litters, depends mainly on the time elapsed between birth and ingestion of colostrum, with limited influence of colostrum IgG concentration. Deficit in passive immune transfer, impacting puppy\u2019s health and neonatal mortality rate, can be indirectly diagnosed through blood gammaglutamyltransferases assay and evaluation of growth rate over the two first days of life. In the absence of maternal colostrum, few homo- and heterospecific immune sources are available and canine colostrum banking remains the optimal solution. Whereas passive immune transfer is crucial for survival during the neonatal period, it later interferes with response to vaccination. In addition to systemic passive immune transfer, maternal antibodies (mainly IgA) would provide local (digestive) immunity, ensuring mid-term protection of the puppies\u2019 gut together with probably long term training of the digestive immune system.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chastant, Sylvie; Mila, Hanna","journal":"Animal Reproduction Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeeadf2c7805644310989d6d4f4e457697454267.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125514.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378432019302659; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.06.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432019302659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255495/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systemic passive immune transfer","quality of passive immune transfer","colostrum intake","ingestion of colostrum","digestive immune system","heterospecific immune sources","absence of maternal colostrum","passive systemic immunity thanks","limited influence of colostrum IgG concentration","days of life","canine colostrum banking","days of age","litters","neonatal mortality rate","maternal antibodies","neonatal period","evaluation of growth rate","blood gammaglutamyltransferases assay","puppy\u2019s health","long term training","homo","survival","puppies\u2019 gut","mid-term protection","IgA","optimal solution","addition","time","immunoglobulins G","birth","Deficit","response","vaccination"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of common enteropathogens and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern in puppies reported with HGE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The canine HGE activity index, with little modification, was adopted to identify Grade III/severely affected puppies below 6 months of age. Fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was employed to screen and compare the enteropathogens in puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea and healthy control. RESULTS: Canine parvovirus 2b was identified in 90.3% of the diarrheic and 10% of the non-diarrheic healthy puppies. Clostridium difficile was identified in all the diarrheic puppies and in 80% of the healthy puppies. Among the diarrheic puppies, 17.7% were positive for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, 9.7% were positive for C. perfringens alpha toxin, 6.4% were positive for Escherichia coli shiga toxin, 6.4% were positive for E. coli enterotoxin (LT), and 3.2% were positive for canine distemper virus. Whereas, none of the healthy puppies were positive for these bacteria and toxins. Fecal antibiotic sensitivity test pattern revealed gentamicin to be sensitive in 95% of the cases, azithromycin in 50%, enrofloxacin in 25%, cefotaxime in 20%, and tetracycline in 5% of the cases.

A simple molecular method for rapid detection of ERG11 gene mutations would be an advantage as a screening tool to identify potentially-resistant strains and to track their movement. To complement DNA sequencing, we developed a padlock probe and rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based method to detect a series of mutations in the C. albicans ERG11 gene using \u0022reference\u0022 azole-resistant isolates with known mutations. The method was then used to estimate the frequency of ERG11 mutations and their type in 25 Australian clinical C. albicans isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and in 23 fluconazole-susceptible isolates. RCA results were compared DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The RCA assay correctly identified all ERG11 mutations in eight \u0022reference\u0022 C. albicans isolates. When applied to 48 test strains, the RCA method showed 100% agreement with DNA sequencing where an ERG11 mutation-specific probe was used. Of 20 different missense mutations detected by sequencing in 24 of 25 (96%) isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility, 16 were detected by RCA. Five missense mutations were detected by both methods in 18 of 23 (78%) fluconazole-susceptible strains. DNA sequencing revealed that mutations in non-susceptible isolates were all due to homozygous nucleotide changes. With the exception of the mutations leading to amino acid substitution E266D, those in fluconazole-susceptible strains were heterozygous. Amino acid substitutions common to both sets of isolates were D116E, E266D, K128T, V437I and V488I. Substitutions unique to isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility were G464 S (n = 4 isolates), G448E (n = 3), G307S (n = 3), K143R (n = 3) and Y123H, S405F and R467K (each n = 1). DNA sequencing revealed a novel substitution, G450V, in one isolate. CONCLUSION: The sensitive RCA assay described here is a simple, robust and rapid (2 h) method for the detection of ERG11 polymorphisms. It showed excellent concordance with ERG11 sequencing and is a potentially valuable tool to track the emergence and spread of azole-resistant C. albicans and to study the epidemiology of ERG11 mutations. The RCA method is applicable to the study of azole resistance in other fungi.","publish_time":"2009-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Huiping; Kong, Fanrong; Sorrell, Tania C; Wang, Bin; McNicholas, Paul; Pantarat, Namfon; Ellis, David; Xiao, Meng; Widmer, Fred; Chen, Sharon CA","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cbb038739adbd4487fa3c529e404189637e59d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2782262.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19682357/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-9-167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ERG11 sequencing","albicans isolates","RCA method","frequency of ERG11 mutations","epidemiology of ERG11 mutations","fluconazole-susceptible isolates","DNA sequencing","azole-resistant isolates","series of mutations","known mutations","albicans ERG11 gene","rapid detection of ERG11 gene mutations","fluconazole-susceptible strains","non-susceptible isolates","RCA results","different missense mutations","reduced fluconazole susceptibility","detection of ERG11 polymorphisms","based method","resistant strains","sensitive RCA assay","reduced susceptibility","study of azole resistance","ERG11 mutation-specific probe","Candida albicans","simple molecular method","relevant azole resistance","amino acid substitution E266D","Amino acid substitutions common","test strains","reference","Substitutions unique","target enzyme Erg11p of azole antifungals","novel substitution","padlock probe","valuable tool","screening tool","type","G464 S","circle amplification","K128T","advantage","agreement","V437I","G450V","D116E","emergence","V488I","Y123H","S405F","R467K","homozygous nucleotide changes","CONCLUSION","fungi","BACKGROUND","excellent concordance","G448E","movement","methods","G307S","K143R","exception"],"language":"en"},

However, awareness of the presence of illness can cause people to change their behaviour by, for example, staying at home and avoiding social contacts. Such changes can be used to control epidemics but they exact an economic cost. Our aim is to study the costs and benefits of using individual-based social distancing undertaken by healthy individuals as a form of control. METHODS: Our model is a standard SIR model superimposed on a spatial network, without and with addition of small-world interactions. Disease spread is controlled by allowing susceptible individuals to temporarily reduce their social contacts in response to the presence of infection within their local neighbourhood. We ascribe an economic cost to the loss of social contacts, and weigh this against the economic benefit gained by reducing the impact of the epidemic. We study the sensitivity of the results to two key parameters, the individuals\u2019 attitude to risk and the size of the awareness neighbourhood. RESULTS: Depending on the characteristics of the epidemic and on the relative economic importance of making contacts versus avoiding infection, the optimal control is one of two extremes: either to adopt a highly cautious control, thereby suppressing the epidemic quickly by drastically reducing contacts as soon as disease is detected; or else to forego control and allow the epidemic to run its course. The worst outcome arises when control is attempted, but not cautiously enough to cause the epidemic to be suppressed. The next main result comes from comparing the size of the neighbourhood of which individuals are aware to that of the neighbourhood within which transmission can occur. The control works best when these sizes match and is particularly ineffective when the awareness neighbourhood is smaller than the infection neighbourhood. The results are robust with respect to inclusion of long-range, small-world links which destroy the spatial structure, regardless of whether individuals can or cannot control them. However, addition of many non-local links eventually makes control ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for the design of control strategies using social distancing: a control that is too weak or based upon inaccurate knowledge, may give a worse outcome than doing nothing.","publish_time":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maharaj, Savi; Kleczkowski, Adam","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b92357afea168410a305eca0e593b7955f08598.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3563464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22905965/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control ineffective","optimal control","form of control","cautious control","infection neighbourhood","awareness neighbourhood","design of control strategies","local neighbourhood","results","loss of social contacts","social distancing","economic cost","presence of infection","healthy individuals","susceptible individuals","economic benefit","small-world links","addition of small","impact of individual behaviour","relative economic importance","non-local links","spatial network","spatial structure","world interactions","presence of illness","worse outcome","Disease spread","worst outcome","standard SIR model","inclusion of long-range","individuals\u2019 attitude","key parameters","risk","respect","implications","response","inaccurate knowledge","dynamics of diseases","BACKGROUND","Existing epidemiological models","costs","people","epidemics","benefits","sizes match","home","example","main result","METHODS","sensitivity","CONCLUSIONS","extremes","characteristics","aim","changes","course","transmission"],"language":"en"},

In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued a structure-based design of peptidomimetic \u03B1-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases.

Indeed, the weaning process is, at present, more of an art than a science. As such, there is urgent need for novel contributions from the scientific literature to abate the growing rates of morbidity and mortality associated with weaning failure. The physician attempting to wean a patient must integrate clinical parameters and common-sense criteria.

Adult hookworms survive for many years in the host intestine, where they suck blood, causing iron deficiency anemia and malnutrition. Numerous molecules, named excretory/secretory (ES) products, are secreted by hookworm adults and/or larvae to aid in parasite survival and pathobiology. Although the molecular cloning and characterization of hookworm ES products began 25 years ago, the biological role and molecular nature of many of them are still unclear. Hookworm ES products, with distinct structures and functions, have been linked to many essential events in the disease pathogenesis. These events include host invasion and tissue migration, parasite nourishment and reproduction, and immune modulation. Several of these products represent promising vaccine targets for controlling hookworm disease and therapeutic targets for many inflammatory diseases. This review aims to summarize our present knowledge about hookworm ES products, including their role in parasite biology, host-parasite interactions, and as vaccine and pharmaceutical targets and to identify research gaps and future research directions in this field.

METHODS: In this study, we took a multi-pronged approach to screen UCP1 activators, including in silico predictions, in vitro assays, as well as in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Base on Connectivity MAP (CMAP) screening, we obtained multiple drugs that possess a remarkably correlating gene expression pattern to that of enhancing activity in BAT and (or) sWAT signature. Particularly, we focused on a previously unreported drug-indirubin, a compound obtained from the Indigo plant, which is now mainly used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In the current study, our results shown that indirubin could enhance the BAT activity, as evidenced by up-regulated Ucp1 expression and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function in vitro cellular model. Furthermore, indirubin treatment restrained high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis which were associated with the increase of energy expenditure in the mice model. Moreover, we revealed that indirubin treatment increased BAT activity by promoting thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in BAT and induced browning of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (sWAT) of mice under HFD. Besides, our results indicated that indirubin induced UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes, at least in part, via activation of PKA and p38MAPK signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show that as an effective BAT (as well as beige cells) activator, indirubin may have a protective effect on the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Gang; Sun, Honglin; Liu, Jun-li; Dong, Kai; Liu, Junli; Zhang, Min","journal":"Nutr Metab (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c671c738ae3ae3a66d74583414548b84f3425638.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7076951.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7076951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CML","HFD","PKA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indirubin treatment increased BAT activity","RESULTS","indirubin induced UCP1 expression","effective BAT","treatment of obesity","activity of brown adipose tissue","unreported drug-indirubin","regulated Ucp1 expression","induced browning of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue","HFD","energy consumption","mice model","treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia","screen UCP1 activators","body\u2019s energy intake","increase of energy expenditure","gene expression pattern","induced body weight gain","mitochondrial biogenesis","brown adipocytes","cellular model","sWAT signature","current study","mitochondrial respiratory function","improved glucose homeostasis","thermogenesis","high-fat diet","multi-pronged approach","screening","CMAP","Connectivity MAP","compound","hepatic steatosis","silico predictions","protective effect","beige cells","CML","Base","prevention","activation of PKA","p38MAPK","pathways","assays","multiple drugs","promising strategies","Indigo plant","BACKGROUND","complications","experiments","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Lyoph-P\u0026P was compared versus the classic protocol using extemporaneously prepared liquid reagents using (i) sensitivity study, (ii) long-term stability at 4 \u00B0C, and (iii) long-term stability at 37 \u00B0C mimicking transportation without cold chain. Two previously published molecular assays were selected for this study. They target two emerging viruses that are listed on the blueprint of the WHO as to be considered for preparedness and response actions: chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV). Results of our study demonstrate that (i) Lyoph-P\u0026P is stable for at least 4 days at 37 \u00B0C supporting shipping without the need of cold chain, (ii) Lyoph-P\u0026P rehydrated solution is stable at \u002B4 \u00B0C for at least two weeks, (iii) sensitivity observed with Lyoph-P\u0026P is at least equal to, often better than, that observed with liquid formulation, (iv) validation of results observed with low-copy specimens is rendered easier by higher fluorescence level. In conclusion, Lyoph-P\u0026P holds several advantages over extemporaneously preparer liquid formulation that merit to be considered when a novel real-time molecular assay is implemented in a laboratory in charge of routine diagnostic activity.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thirion, Laurence; Dubot-Peres, Audrey; Pezzi, Laura; Corcostegui, Iban; Touinssi, Mhammed; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Charrel, Remi N.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d1f0da1d9a67051f6f28aea17448a27dbe69415.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077261.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077261/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lyoph-P","P rehydrated solution","sensitivity study","C mimicking transportation","long-term stability","Real-time molecular techniques","preparer liquid formulation","delayed results","validation of results","novel real-time molecular assay","prepared liquid reagents","need of cold chain","published molecular assays","CHIKV","single tube","hydrolysis probe","chikungunya virus","reference methods","laboratory","Rift Valley fever phlebovirus","oligonucleotide primers","invalid series","order","risk of human errors","response actions","predefined optimized concentrations","specimens","shipping","classic protocol","lyophilization","advantages","key factor","charge of routine diagnostic activity","process of preparation","direct diagnosis of pathogens","preparedness","RVFV","days","higher fluorescence level","reduction of steps","conclusion","weeks","emerging viruses","blueprint"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The respiratory burst of PMNs was determined with luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) in resting cells and following N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or opsonized zymosan (OZ) stimulation and expressed in arbitrary CL units times assay-time (aU \u00D7 min). The expressions of CD11b/CD18, CD10, and CD13 receptors were determined with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Basal PMN CL was increased in HD patients to up to 1285 \u00B1 129 aU \u00D7 min compared with 895 \u00B1 88 aU \u00D7 min in healthy controls (p \u003C 0.05).

PMA-stimulated CL of PMNs was similar to control values. The oxidative burst in PMNs from HD patients and healthy controls was similar in response to TNF-\u03B1 alone.

We recently demonstrated that the vast majority of BDV genomes and antigenomes possess uniformly trimmed 5\u2032 termini, even if the virus is recovered from complementary DNA encoding a hypothetical full-length viral genome. Here we discuss different mechanisms which might lead to the selective 5\u2032-terminal trimming of the BDV genome and subsequent retrieval of the lost genetic information. We further discuss possible benefits of genome trimming in the light of recent findings that terminal RNA structures are recognized by intracellular sensors which trigger innate immunity.

Based on results showing that the intermediate compartment (IC) at the ER-Golgi boundary constitutes a stable tubular network that maintains its dynamics in the presence of BFA, we propose that two bidirectional Golgi-bypass pathways to the PM exist, a direct route from early IC elements, and another, reminescent of the yeast secretory pathway, from late IC elements via the endosomal system.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at identifying the problem areas in GPs\u2019 patient care during the H1N1 and EHEC (enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli) outbreaks. With this information, recommendations for guaranteeing proper patient care during future epidemics/pandemics can be derived. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 12 qualitative, semi-structured, open guideline interviews with GPs in Hamburg and L\u00FCbeck were conducted, transcribed, and evaluated with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Five areas in ambulatory patient care were identified in which changes are needed from the primary care perspective: provision of information for GPs, workload, financing of epidemic-related measures, organization of the practices, care of those taken ill. CONCLUSIONS: The workload of GPs in particular can and should be reduced through successful, centralized information distribution during epidemics/pandemics. The GP\u2019s function as a coordinator should be supported and consolidated, in order to relieve the in-patient sector in cases of an epidemic/pandemic. Secured financing of epidemic-associated measures can help ensure patient care.","publish_time":"2014-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eisele, Marion; Hansen, Heike; Wagner, Hans-Otto; von Leitner, Eike; Pohontsch, Nadine; Scherer, Martin","journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b64358b0398f3930ee9d36f459e008f7155840d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079901.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EHEC"],"locations":["Germany","Hamburg"],"keyphrases":["proper patient care","GPs\u2019 patient care","ambulatory patient care","pandemics","primary care givers","primary care perspective","workload of GPs","future epidemics","provision of information","Secured financing of epidemic","centralized information distribution","related measures","associated measures","coordinating function","problem areas","GP\u2019s function","qualitative content analysis","open guideline interviews","EHEC","H1N1","enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli","general practitioners","Hamburg","organization","difficulties","outbreaks","in-patient sector","cases","key role","practices","recommendations","changes","study","Germany","L\u00FCbeck","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","order","studies","METHODS","coordinator","CONCLUSIONS","MATERIALS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

We herein report the design of a microarray immunoassay based on synthetic peptides derived from the GBV-C E2 protein to evaluate their diagnostic value in detecting anti-E2 antibodies in HIV-1 patients. To this end, peptide microarrays were initially prepared to identify the most relevant epitopes in the GBV-C E2 protein. Thus, 124 peptides composed of 18 amino acids covering the whole E2-protein sequence, with 15 residue overlaps, were spotted in triplicate onto \u03B3-aminopropyl silane-functionalised adsorbent binding slides. The procedure to select the E2 protein epitopes was carried out using serum samples from HIV-1-infected patients. The samples had previously been tested for the presence or absence of GBV-C anti-E2 antibodies by means of the Abbott test. Thus, 11 specific epitopes in the GBV-C E2 protein were identified. Subsequently, peptide antigen microarrays were constructed using the E2 epitopes identified to detect GBV-C anti-E2 antibodies in the serum of HIV-1-infected patients with no known GBV-C co-infection. The 11 peptides selected identified anti-E2 GBV-C antibodies among HIV-1-infected patients, and a reactivity of 47 % was established. The potential antigenic peptides selected could be considered a useful tool for designing a new diagnostic system based on peptide microarrays to determine anti-GBV-C E2 antibodies in the serum of HIV-1-infected patients.

Data collection was conducted using questionnaires and on-site visits, focussing on aspects of infrastructure, technical equipment, and the availability of trained personnel. RESULTS: Although all centres enrolled were listed as \u201Cisolation units\u201D, all aspects evaluated differed broadly. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a \u2018High Level Isolation Unit\u2019, as 6/8 enrolled German facilities did. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital. DISCUSSION: Within and between nations contributing data disparities regarding the fulfilment of guidelines published were seen. German isolation facilities mostly fulfilled all criteria evaluated and performed on a high technical level. However, data presented do not reflect the current situation in Germany due to the time that has elapsed since the study was conducted.

Since molecular structure is related to molecular function, careful selection of molecular substitutions will result in more drugs that are potent. In this work, QSAR parameters are selected in order to compare the four drugs used as nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) for non-structural 5B (NS5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of hepatitis C virus (HCV). These drugs are: ribavirin (widely used over the last 20 years), sofosbuvir (approved on December 2013 by FDA), and finally IDX-184 and R7128 (phase IIb of clinical trial drugs). The nucleotide analogues uracil (U), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) from which these drugs are fabricated are also compared to that group of drugs. QSAR parameters suggested that the drug IDX-184 is the best among all of the studied NIs. It also shows that NIs are always more reactive than their parent nucleotide. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: The active site environment of 12 amino acids coordinated with IDX-184 through two Mg(2\u002B). The interaction with HCV subtypes 1a, 2b, and 3b is better than 4a subtype.

I resolve this dilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three nonlinear ODE\u2019s. The method makes use of the probability generating function (PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network and makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a well-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of infecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating between network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic incidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the evolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The equations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree distribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with which it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are observed to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller final size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson. The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement with the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of determining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to occur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.","publish_time":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Volz, Erik","journal":"J Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b02f563c662d2d521c4e4c34fdb73190b74280a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080148/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homogeneous degree distributions","degree distribution plays","specified degree distributions","Power law degree distributions","Random networks","use of network","epidemic threshold","epidemic incidence","epidemic behavior","node-centric quantities","node-centric variables","number of infecteds","PGF","susceptibles","dynamic equations","theory","smaller final size","simple means of translating","modeling SIR-type epidemics","number of edges","large-scale epidemics","SIR dynamics","realistic models of population structure","well-defined category","probability","problem","alternative way","formalism","evolution","dramatic effects","good agreement","immediate expansion phase","stochastic simulations","function","system","finite-sized outbreaks","Poisson","nonlinear ODE\u2019s","dilemma","method","time","speed"],"language":"en"},

A total of 16 Mafa-DOB, 16 Mafa-DPB1, and 34 Mafa-DQB1 alleles were identified, which revealed limited, moderate, and marked allelic polymorphism at DOB, DPB1, and DQB1, respectively, in a cohort of cynomolgus macaques of Vietnamese origin. In addition, 16 Mafa-DOB, 5 Mafa-DPB1, and 8 Mafa-DQB1 alleles represented novel sequences that had not been reported in earlier studies. Almost of the sequences detected at the DOB and DQB1 locus in the present study belonged to DOB*01 (100%) and DQB1*06 (62%) lineages, respectively. Interestingly, four, three, and one high-frequency alleles were detected at Mafa-DOB, -DPB1, and -DQB1, respectively, in this monkeys. The alleles with the highest frequency among these monkeys were Mafa-DOB*010102, Mafa-DPB1*13, and Mafa-DQB1*0616, and these were found in 33 (25.6%) of 129 monkeys, 32 (31.37%) of 102 monkeys, and 30 (31%) of 143 monkeys, respectively.

Some of these include adjusting for individual follow-up time, repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others. Furthermore, pre-specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected. Although existing guidelines such as CONSORT encourage thorough reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, they provide limited details for safety data analysis. The limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above. A typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy. Lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy. METHODS: The search included five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Malaria in Pregnancy Library and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify original English articles reporting Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention in pregnancy published from January 2010 to July 2019. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were included in this review that collected multiple longitudinal safety outcomes including AEs. Statistical analysis and reporting of the safety outcomes in all the trials used descriptive statistics; proportions/counts (n = 18, 100%) and mean/median (n = 2, 11.1%). Results presentation included tabular (n = 16, 88.9%) and text description (n = 2, 11.1%). Univariate inferential methods were reported in most trials (n = 16, 88.9%); including Chi square/Fisher\u2019s exact test (n = 12, 66.7%), t test (n = 2, 11.1%) and Mann\u2013Whitney/Wilcoxon test (n = 1, 5.6%). Multivariable methods, including Poisson and negative binomial were reported in few trials (n = 3, 16.7%). Assessment of a potential link between missing efficacy data and safety outcomes was not reported in any of the trials that reported efficacy missing data (n = 7, 38.9%). CONCLUSION: The review demonstrated that statistical analysis of safety data in anti-malarial drugs for malarial chemoprevention in pregnancy RCTs is inadequate. The analyses insufficiently account for multiple safety outcomes potential dependence, follow-up time and informative missing data which can compromise anti-malarial drug safety evidence development, based on the available data.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patson, Noel; Mukaka, Mavuto; Otwombe, Kennedy N.; Kazembe, Lawrence; Mathanga, Don P.; Mwapasa, Victor; Kabaghe, Alinune N.; Eijkemans, Marinus J.

ACUTE HYPERCAPNIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE A1. Acute Exacerbation of COPD: Recommendations: NIV should be used in management of acute exacerbation of COPD in patients with acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (pH = 7.25-7.35). (1A) NIV should be attempted in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (pH \u003C7.25 \u0026 PaCO2 \u2265 45) before initiating invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) except in patients requiring immediate intubation. (2A). Lower the pH higher the chance of failure of NIV. (2B) NIV should not to be used routinely in normo- or mildly hyper-capneic patients with acute exacerbation of COPD, without acidosis (pH \u003E 7.35). (2B) A2. NIV in ARF due to Chest wall deformities/Neuromuscular diseases: Recommendations: NIV may be used in patients of ARF due to chest wall deformity/Neuromuscular diseases. (PaCO2 \u2265 45) (UPP) A3. NIV in ARF due to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS): Recommendations: NIV may be used in AHRF in OHS patients when they present with acute hypercapnic or acute on chronic respiratory failure (pH 45). (3B) NIV/CPAP may be used in obese, hypercapnic patients with OHS and/or right heart failure in the absence of acidosis. (UPP) B. NIV IN ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: B1. NIV in Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema: Recommendations: NIV is recommended in hospital patients with ARF, due to Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). NIV should be used in patients with acute heart failure/ cardiogenic pulmonary edema, right from emergency department itself. (1B) Both CPAP and BiPAP modes are safe and effective in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). However, BPAP (NIV-PS) should be preferred in cardiogenic pulmonary edema with hypercapnia. (3A) B2. NIV in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: Recommendations: NIV may be used over conventional oxygen therapy in mild early acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (P/F ratio \u003C300 and \u003E200 mmHg), under close supervision. (2B) We strongly recommend against a trial of NIV in patients with acute hypoxemic failure with P/F ratio \u003C150. (2A) B3. NIV in ARF due to Chest Trauma: Recommendations: NIV may be used in traumatic flail chest along with adequate pain relief. (3B) B4. NIV in Immunocompromised Host: Recommendations: In Immunocompromised patients with early ARF, we may consider NIV over conventional oxygen. (2B). B5. NIV in Palliative Care: Recommendations: We strongly recommend use of NIV for reducing dyspnea in palliative care setting. (2A) B6. NIV in post-operative cases: Recommendations: NIV should be used in patients with post-operative acute respiratory failure. (2A) B6a. NIV in abdominal surgery: Recommendations: NIV may be used in patients with ARF following abdominal surgeries. (2A) B6b. NIV in bariatric surgery: Recommendations: NIV may be used in post-bariatric surgery patients with pre-existent OSA or OHS. (3A) B6c. NIV in Thoracic surgery: Recommendations: In cardiothoracic surgeries, use of NIV is recommended post operatively for acute respiratory failure to improve oxygenation and reduce chance of reintubation. (2A) NIV should not be used in patients undergoing esophageal surgery. (UPP) B6d. NIV in post lung transplant: Recommendations: NIV may be used for shortening weaning time and to avoid re-intubation following lung transplantation. (2B) B7. NIV during Procedures (ETI/Bronchoscopy/TEE/Endoscopy): Recommendations: NIV may be used for pre-oxygenation before intubation. (2B) NIV with appropriate interface may be used in patients of ARF during Bronchoscopy/Endoscopy to improve oxygenation. (3B) B8. NIV in Viral Pneumonitis ARDS: Recommendations: NIV cannot be considered as a treatment of choice for patients with acute respiratory failure with H1N1 pneumonia. However, it may be reasonable to use NIV in selected patients with single organ involvement, in a strictly controlled environment with close monitoring. (2B) B9. NIV and Acute exacerbation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Recommendations: Careful use of NIV in patients with acute Tuberculosis may be considered, with effective infection control precautions to prevent air-borne transmission. (3B) B10. NIV after planned extubation in high risk patients: Recommendation: We recommend that NIV may be used to wean high risk patients from invasive mechanical ventilation as it reduces re-intubation rate. (2B) B11. NIV for respiratory distress post extubation: Recommendations: We recommend that NIV therapy should not be used to manage respiratory distress post-extubation in high risk patients. (2B) C. APPLICATION OF NIV: Recommendation: Choice of mode should be mainly decided by factors like disease etiology and severity, the breathing effort by the patient and the operator familiarity and experience. (UPP) We suggest using flow trigger over pressure triggering in assisted modes, as it provides better patient ventilator synchrony. Especially in COPD patients, flow triggering has been found to benefit auto PEEP. (3B) D. MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT ON NIV: D1. Sedation: Recommendations: A non-pharmacological approach to calm the patient (Reassuring the patient, proper environment) should always be tried before administrating sedatives. (UPP) In patients on NIV, sedation may be used with extremely close monitoring and only in an ICU setting with lookout for signs of NIV failure. (UPP) E. EQUIPMENT: Recommendations: We recommend that portable bilevel ventilators or specifically designed ICU ventilators with non-invasive mode should be used for delivering Non\u2013invasive ventilation in critically ill patients. (UPP) Both critical care ventilators with leak compensation and bi-level ventilators have been equally effective in decreasing the WOB, RR, and PaCO2. (3B) Currently, Oronasal mask is the most preferred interface for non-invasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure. (3B) F. WEANING: Recommendations: We recommend that weaning from NIV may be done by a standardized protocol driven approach of the unit.

For this purpose, we developed specific transfer vectors containing the gene encoding for the highly antigenic structural ASFV protein p54 in which foreign sequences were introduced. DNA sequences encoding continuous linear epitopes, the antigenic site A from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 protein and the DAff3 antigenic determinant from transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) nucleoprotein N, were separately cloned into the p54 gene, in a region encoding a non-essential domain of the protein. Chimeric p54 genes were inserted by homologous recombination into the thymidine kinase (TK) locus of ASFV genome. The resulting recombinant viruses efficiently expressed both chimeric proteins under transcriptional control of the p54 promoter, and the chimeric gene products were recognized by antibodies to both p54 and foreign epitopes. The modified p54 proteins were also found in the viral particles and complemented the function of the wild-type p54, since deletion of the p54 gene from recombinant viruses did not affected virus replication in Vero cells. This work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of incorporating foreign amino acid sequences (up to 18 residues) into a protein component of the ASFV particle without affecting virus viability.","publish_time":"2014-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brun, A.; Rodr\u00EDguez, F.; Parra, F.; Sobrino, F.; Escribano, J.

The procaryotic GST-ORF3 recombinant fusion protein was used to raise a monospecific antiserum in rabbits. By Western-immunoblotting with PRRSV-infected cell extracts, the ORF3 encoded protein had an estimated molecular mass (M(r)) of 42 kDa, similar to that of the protein expressed by the adenovirus vector. Endoglycosidase F digestion showed that the ORF3 encoded protein occurs in an highly glycosylated form (GP(3)) in the infected MARC-145 cells. Pulse-chase and radioimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the GP(3) protein was present in amounts equivalent to those of the N, M, and GP(5) proteins in the infected cells, whereas no GP(3) could be detected in purified virions. During the first 30 min of chase, the GP(3) undergoes a gradual downward shift of its apparent M(r), thought to result from trimming of the mannose-rich glycan structures. Tested convalescent pig sera that were found to be seropositive to PRRSV by indirect immunofluorescence reacted positively with the recombinant GST-ORF3 fusion protein by immunoblotting. Data indicated that the ORF3 protein of the Quebec reference strain of PRRSV is a highly glycosylated and antigenic protein, which is nonstructural.","publish_time":"2014-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonin, P.; Mardassi, H.; Gagnon, C.

To understand the cellular basis of this antiviral effect, we studied the possible involvement of arginine metabolism through nitric oxide (NO) and arginase induction, since these metabolic pathways have been described as implicated in antiviral activities of macrophages. The studies were performed by activating macrophages with inducers of NO (IFN gamma) and arginase (IL4 IL10). NO synthase (iNOS) and arginase inhibitors (N-methyl-arginine, NMA, and hydroxyarginine, OH-ARG) were used. The results show that in both macrophage populations, no spontaneous synthesis of NO occurred and the MHV3 enhanced the NO release induced by IFN gamma. After activation with IFN gamma, BALB/c macrophages released higher amounts of NO than the A/J macrophages. The inhibition of IFN gamma-induced NO-synthesis with NMA or with arginine free medium did not affect the virus replication. In BALB/c macrophages, IL4 or IL10, induced higher amounts of arginase than in A/J macrophages. In both macrophage populations the MHV3 infection had no influence on the arginase synthesized, and the inhibition of the arginase with OH-ARG had no influence on the virus growth. The level of MHV3 replication or inhibition was also not influenced when we used macrophages from knockout mice for the iNOS gene, and as a consequence were unable of synthesizing NO. These data indicate that NO and arginase do not participate in the anti-MHV3 state induced by IFN gamma in macrophages.","publish_time":"1997-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira, C.

The sequences of these six ERBV RT-PCR positive samples had 93\u201396% nucleotide identity with six other partially sequenced ERBV1 isolates and one ERBV2. ERBV was isolated from one of the six samples at fourth cell culture passage when it was shown that the addition of 20 mg/mL MgCl(2) to the cell culture medium enhanced the growth of the virus. This isolated virus was antigenically similar to ERBV2.313/75. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the P1 region of the genome also indicated that the isolate was ERBV2, and it was therefore designated ERBV2.1576/99.

Consequently, changes occurring in Australian IBV illustrate, independently from other countries, types of variability that could occur in emerging IBV strains. Previously, we have identified two distinct genetic groups of IBV, designated subgroups 1 and 2. IBV strains of subgroup 1 have S1 and N proteins that share a high degree of amino acid identity, 81 to 98% in S1 and 91 to 99% in N. Subgroup 2 strains possess S1 and N proteins that share a low level of identity with subgroup 1 strains: 54 to 62% in S1 and 60 to 62% in N. This paper describes the isolation and characterisation of a third, previously undetected genetic group of IBV in Australia. The subgroup 3 strains, represented by isolate chicken/Australia/N2/04, had an S1 protein that shared a low level of identity with both subgroups 1 and 2: 61 to 63% and 56 to 59%, respectively. However, the N protein and the 3\u2032 untranslated region were similar to subgroup 1: 90 to 97% identical with the N protein of subgroup 1 strains. This N4/02 subgroup 3 of IBV is reminiscent of two other strains, D1466 and DE072, isolated in the Netherlands and in the USA, respectively. The emergence of the subgroup 3 viruses in Australia, as well as the emergence of subgroup 2 in 1988, could not be explained by any of the mechanisms that are currently considered to be involved in generation of IBV variants.","publish_time":"2006-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ignjatovic, J.; Gould, G.; Sapats, S.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ccfed9844a75a49c3a45a284a86776dc8e8fb63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzgyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","N.

A retrospective analysis was performed using electronic patient records. We identified 105 admissions in 93 patients with a median age of 5.7 (IQR 2.6\u201314.5) years. Eritrea, Syria, and Afghanistan were the most frequent countries of origin. The median duration of admission was 4 (IQR 2\u20136) days with infections and elective surgical interventions being the most common reason (54.8 and 16.1%, respectively). Most infections were airway, skin, and gastrointestinal in 46.4, 20.2, and 11.9%, respectively. The prevalence of tropical infections was 11.9%. The main pathogens identified were influenza A virus (13.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), and rhino/enterovirus (10.3%). Previous medical non-infectious conditions were recorded in 13%. Conclusion: The study revealed a high burden of infections in admitted patients mostly caused by well-known pathogens prevalent also in the local population. Both tropical infections and pre-existing non-infectious conditions are also important in admitted patients.

I discuss the ethical challenges associated with caring for patients in strict isolation and personnel wearing bulky protective gear with reduced dexterity and flexibility, the limitations this may place on available treatments and the permissibility of consequent departures from the standards of care. Restricting access to some interventions such as surgery requiring an operating room, advanced imaging, etc. is reasonable due to concern for protecting other patients, visitors and staff. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a special case and the implications for withholding this intervention in situations where it may be desired is discussed, especially with respect to those patients who have suspected, but not proven, infection. These same restrictions are also considered under conditions where there are scarce resources and thus limited numbers of patients may receive care. While it is to be hoped that there is only limited and sporadic infection with Ebola virus in the US, careful thought must be given to the care of these patients under the unusual circumstances demanded by their isolation.

ITC experiments show that the interaction of the complex with yeast tRNA is driven by a moderately favorable enthalpy decrease in combination with a moderately favorable entropy increase, while the binding of the complex to CT DNA is driven by a large favorable enthalpy decrease with a less favorable entropy increase. The results from equilibrium dialysis and CD suggest that both interactions are enantioselective and the \u0394 enantiomer of the complex may bind more favorably to both yeast tRNA and CT DNA than the \u039B enantiomer does, and that the complex is a better candidate for an enantioselective binder to yeast tRNA than to CT DNA.

The genomic RNA of CCHFV is enwrapped by its nucleoprotein. Positively charged residues on CCHFV nucleoprotein provide multiple binding sites to facilitate genomic RNA encapsidation. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism underlying preferential packaging of the negative sense genomic RNA by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of host cell RNAs during viral assembly. The work included genome sequence analyses for different families of negative and positive sense RNA viruses, using serial docking experiments and molecular dynamic simulations. Our results indicated that the main determinant parameter of the nucleoprotein binding affinity for negative sense RNA is the ratio of purine/pyrimidine in the RNA molecule. A negative sense RNA with a purine/pyrimidine ratio (\u003E1) higher than that of a positive sense RNA (\u003C1) exhibits higher affinity for the nucleoprotein. Our calculations revealed that a negative sense RNA expresses about 0.5 kJ/mol higher binding energy per nucleotide compared to a positive sense RNA. This energy difference produces a binding energy high enough to make the negative sense RNA, the preferred substrate for packaging by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of cellular or complementary positive sense RNAs. The outcome of this study may contribute to ongoing researches on other viral diseases caused by negative sense RNA viruses such as Ebola virus which poses a security threat to all humanity.","publish_time":"2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dayer, Mohammad Reza; Dayer, Mohammad Saaid; Rezatofighi, Seyedeh Elham","journal":"Protein J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c77f28ceba9f46431dba25d738cc3482b4f0639.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever","RNA","CCHFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative sense genomic RNA","negative sense RNA viruses","negative sense RNA expresses","negative sense RNA nairovirus","positive sense RNA viruses","RNA molecule","genomic RNA of CCHFV","genomic RNA encapsidation","CCHFV nucleoprotein","complementary positive sense RNAs","nucleoprotein binding affinity","different families of negative","binding energy high","mol higher binding energy","higher affinity","multiple binding sites","ratio of purine","energy difference","pyrimidine ratio","presence of cellular","presence of host cell RNAs","viral diseases","preferential packaging","viral assembly","present work","infectious disease of high virulence","serial docking experiments","kJ","mortality","nucleotide","preferred substrate","Ebola virus","genome sequence analyses","main determinant parameter","molecular dynamic simulations","mechanism","Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever","security threat","ongoing researches","residues","study","results","calculations","humanity","outcome"],"language":"en"},

The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing.

While there have been no recent outbreaks of the disease, the threat remains as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) like strains still exist in animal reservoirs. Therefore, the development of a vaccine against SARS is in grave need. Here, we have designed and produced a prototypic SARS vaccine: a self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle that repetitively displays a SARS B-cell epitope from the C-terminal heptad repeat of the virus\u2019 spike protein. Biophysical analyses with circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering confirmed the computational design showing \u03B1-helcial nanoparticles with sizes of about 25 nm. Immunization experiments with no adjuvants were performed with BALB/c mice. An investigation of the binding properties of the elicited antibodies showed that they were highly conformation specific for the coiled-coil epitope because they specifically recognized the native trimeric conformation of C-terminal heptad repeat region. Consequently, the antisera exhibited neutralization activity in an in vitro infection inhibition assay. We conclude that these peptide nanoparticles represent a promising platform for vaccine design, in particular for diseases that are characterized by neutralizing epitopes with coiled-coil conformation such as SARS-CoV or other enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pimentel, Tais A.

Analysis of the immune responses showed that the chimeric VLPs elicited serum antibodies specific for both PRRSV GP5 and the H3N2 HA protein, and they stimulated cellular immune responses compared to the responses to equivalent amounts of inactivated viruses. Taken together, the results suggested that the chimeric VLP vaccine represents a potential strategy for the development of a safe and effective vaccine to control PRRSV and H3N2 influenza virus.","publish_time":"2014-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xue, Chunyi; Wang, Wei; Liu, Qiliang; Miao, Zhongwei; Liu, Kang; Shen, Huifang; Lv, Lishan; Li, Xiaoming; Chen, Xiaochun; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80c223c83157e79e2c195eb742f7ae4f05743343.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086999.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2178-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chimeric virus","H3N2 influenza virus","swine influenza","PRRSV GP5 protein","respiratory syndrome virus","chimeric VLP vaccine","H3N2 HA protein","swine industry","vaccine candidate","effective vaccine","NA protein","contagious swine diseases","cellular immune responses","chimeric VLPs elicited serum antibodies specific","potential strategy","development","particle","M1 proteins","transmembrane domains","equivalent amounts of inactivated viruses","heavy economic losses","severe threats","immunogenicity","results","mice","Analysis","study"],"language":"en"},

In Poland, the 2014/2015 influenza epidemic started in week 5 (January/February) of 2015 and continued until week 17 (April) of 2015. The influenza activity was moderate with the highest incidence of influence-like illness at week 10/2015 (March). During that season, antigenic drift of influenza virus A/H3N2/ occurred causing higher rates of A/H3N2/ infections. Among the 2416 tested specimens, 22.6 % of influenza cases were positive for A/H3N2/, while A/H1N1/pdm09 constituted 14.6 % cases. Influenza A viruses were detected in co-circulation with influenza B viruses; the latter amounted to 34.1 % of all influenza detections. Other detected causes of influenza-like illness consisted of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), being predominant, and, sporadically, human coronavirus, parainfluenza 1\u20133, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. Despite low vaccine effectiveness of solely one component, A/H3N2/, the vaccine could mitigate or shorten the length of influenza infection and reduce the number of severe outcomes and mortality.

Given the constant rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, treatment failure is increasingly frequent. In this context, innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Stimulation of innate immune cells in the respiratory tract [via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)] is an attractive approach for rapidly activating the body\u0027s immune defenses against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Previous studies of the TLR5 agonist flagellin in animal models showed that standalone TLR stimulation does not result in the effective treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infection but does significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of concomitant antibiotic treatment. Here, we investigated the antibacterial interaction between antibiotic and intranasal flagellin in a mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection. Using various doses of orally administered amoxicillin or systemically administered cotrimoxazole, we found that the intranasal instillation of flagellin (a dose that promotes maximal lung pro-inflammatory responses) induces synergistic rather than additive antibacterial effects against antibiotic\u2013susceptible pneumococcus. We next set up a model of infection with pneumococcus that is resistant to multiple antibiotics in the context of influenza superinfection. Remarkably, the combination of amoxicillin and flagellin effectively treated superinfection with the amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcus since the bacterial clearance was increased by more than 100-fold compared to standalone treatments. Our results also showed that, in response to flagellin, the lung tissue generated an innate immune response even though it had been damaged by the influenza virus and pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the selective boosting of lung innate immunity is a conceptually advantageous approach for improving the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment and fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","publish_time":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matarazzo, Laura; Casilag, Fiordiligie; Porte, R\u00E9mi; Wallet, Frederic; Cayet, Delphine; Faveeuw, Christelle; Carnoy, Christophe; Sirard, Jean-Claude","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d021f582f338ea0a0e9a61e6a4e76df73287b1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6465676.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intranasal flagellin","effectiveness of antibiotic treatment","respiratory tract","antibiotic-resistant bacteria","amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcus","effective treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infection","intranasal instillation of flagellin","innate immune response","therapeutic outcome of concomitant antibiotic treatment","mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection","treatment failure","administered amoxicillin","model of infection","Bacterial infections","pneumococcal infections","TLR5 agonist flagellin","Stimulation of innate immune cells","lung tissue","bacterial resistance","susceptible pneumococcus","bacterial clearance","context of influenza superinfection","combination of amoxicillin","selective boosting of lung innate immunity","body\u0027s immune defenses","standalone TLR stimulation","multiple antibiotics","advantageous approach","antibacterial interaction","attractive approach","administered cotrimoxazole","influenza virus","standalone treatments","maximal lung pro-inflammatory responses","additive antibacterial effects","innovative therapeutic strategies","animal models","activation of Toll","broad spectrum of microorganisms","TLRs","Previous studies","constant rise","major cause of death","receptors","various doses","fold","conclusion","results"],"language":"en"},

There is an urgent need to establish an effective and unbiased method to evaluate and monitor such contamination. This study aims to investigate the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect possible contamination in the microbiology laboratory. Environmental samples were taken at multiple sites at the lab including the inner site of centrifuge rotor, the bench used for molecular biological tests, the benches of biosafety cabinets used for viral culture, clinical sample pre-treatment and nucleic acids extraction, by scrubbing the sites using sterile flocked swabs. The extracted total nucleic acids were used to construct the libraries for deep sequencing according to the protocol of Ion Torrent platform. At least 1G raw data was obtained for each sample. The reads of viruses and bacteria accounted for 0.01 \u00B1 0.02%, and 77.76 \u00B1 12.53% of total reads respectively. The viral sequences were likely to be derived from gene amplification products, the nucleic acids contaminated in fetal bovine serum. Reads from environmental microorganisms were also identified.

The risk of contamination from reagents, remnant DNA and environment should be considered in data analysis and results interpretation.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Li; Yang, Bin; Li, Mingkun; Ren, Lili; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Biosafety and Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edcd72779c065a19742dc23ada42010e367f8acb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053619300035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053619300035","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of contamination","nucleic acids contaminations","nucleic acids extraction","possible contamination","extracted total nucleic acids","NGS method","risk of potential laboratory contamination","total reads","prevention of pathogenic microbiological contamination","unbiased method","monitoring","reads of viruses","viral culture","multiple sites","generation sequencing","viral sequences","data analysis","deep sequencing","promising utility","results interpretation","microbiology laboratory","Environmental samples","environmental microorganisms","clinical sample pre-treatment","benches of biosafety cabinets","G raw data","important tasks of biosafety management","molecular biological tests","inner site of centrifuge rotor","reagents","different sources","gene amplification products","remnant DNA","surveillance","fetal bovine serum","protocol of Ion Torrent platform","sterile flocked swabs","libraries","urgent need","bacteria","study"],"language":"en"},

AIMS: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID\u201019, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission. METHODS: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID\u201019 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak. RESULTS: With an incidence of 3% (1/41)\u201079% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID\u201019 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)\u201050.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)\u201049.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)\u201066.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)\u201029.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)\u20106.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)\u201013.7% (10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 \u00B1 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6% (5/138)\u201015.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)\u201066.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. In 36% (5/14)\u201053% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2\u20105 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)\u201082% (54/66) patients for 1\u201011 days. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID\u201019, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 enters gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and the faeces of COVID\u201019 patients are potentially infectious.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Yuan; Rong, Long; Nian, Weidong; He, Yan","journal":"Aliment Pharmacol Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44ebe26be742ce126ac5597fd055e33c92a13ec6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161803.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32222988/; https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15731","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID","proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms","children patients","gastrointestinal manifestations","gastrointestinal features of COVID","gastrointestinal bleeding","nonsevere patients","group of patients","digestive symptoms","gastrointestinal epithelial cells","common gastrointestinal symptom","pathological findings of patients","faeces of COVID","vs","Vomiting","Faecal excretion","absence of respiratory symptoms","Faecal PCR testing","higher proportion of severe cases","days","diarrhoea","incidence of digestive manifestations","faecal test results","sputum PCR positive","digestive system","later stage","possibility of faecal transmission","lower severe rate","nonsevere cases","respiratory specimen PCR detection","sputum excretion","abdominal pain","nausea","infectious virus particles","early stage","recent epidemic","included anorexia","virus nucleocapsid protein","little published evidence","adults","retrospective clinical studies","case reports","differences","enzyme","different regions","mean duration","BACKGROUND","Angiotensin","China","increased prevalence","CONCLUSIONS","outbreak","SARS","METHODS","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

The overall fold of CEACAM7 is similar to those of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5; however, there are differences, the most notable of which is an insertion that causes the C\u2032\u2032 strand to buckle, leading to the creation of a hydrogen bond in the dimerization interface. The K (dimerization) for CEACAM7 determined by sedimentation equilibrium is tenfold tighter than that measured for CEACAM5.

Here, we propose such a conceptual framework based on changes in the interplay of pathogens, hosts and environment that lead to the formation of novel disease patterns and pathogen genetic adjustment. We categorize infectious disease emergence events into three groups: (i) pathogens showing up in a novel host, ranging from spill-over, including zoonoses, to complete species jumps; (ii) mutant pathogens displaying novel traits in the same host, including an increase in virulence, antimicrobial resistance and host immune escape; and (iii) disease complexes emerging in a new geographic area, either through range expansion or through long distance jumps. Each of these categories is characterized by a typical set of drivers of emergence, matching pathogen trait profiles, disease ecology and transmission dynamics. Our framework may assist in disentangling and structuring the rapidly growing amount of available information on infectious diseases.

Direct transmission cycles are often implicated in these outbreaks, with virus shed in bat feces, urine, and saliva. An additional mode of virus transmission between bats and humans requiring further exploration is the spread of disease via arthropod vectors. Despite the shared ecological niches that bats fill with many hematophagous arthropods (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, etc.) known to play a role in the transmission of medically important arboviruses, knowledge surrounding the potential for bats to act as reservoirs for arboviruses is limited. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken examining the current understanding and potential for bats to act as reservoirs for viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. Serosurveillance and viral isolation from either free-ranging or captive bats are described in relation to four arboviral groups (Bunyavirales, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Togaviridae). Further, ecological associations between bats and hematophagous viral vectors are characterized (e.g., bat bloodmeals in mosquitoes, ingestion of mosquitoes by bats, etc). Lastly, knowledge gaps related to hematophagous ectoparasites (bat bugs and bed bugs (Cimicidae) and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae)), in addition to future directions for characterization of bat-vector-virus relationships are described.","publish_time":"2019-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fagre, Anna C.; Kading, Rebekah C.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0defab5b2520008da1413d0f75d29fe0ae656ea9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466281.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832426/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["captive bats","bat bugs","characterization of bat","bat flies","bat feces","bat bloodmeals","bat reservoir hosts","hematophagous arthropods","hematophagous viral vectors","hematophagous ectoparasites","potential","ingestion of mosquitoes","humans","additional mode of virus transmission","reservoirs","vector-virus relationships","Direct transmission cycles","bed bugs","SARS-CoV","knowledge gaps","MERS-CoV","viral isolation","arthropod vectors","important arboviruses","ecological associations","re-emerging viruses","shared ecological niches","Cimicidae","Bunyavirales","Nipah","Flaviviridae","Hendra","coronaviruses","henipaviruses","overt pathology","arboviral groups","spread of disease","future directions","current understanding","comprehensive literature review","Ebola","Marburg","Reoviridae","filoviruses","Streblidae","Nycteribiidae","exploration","urine","Togaviridae","Serosurveillance","saliva","ticks","outbreaks","midges","role"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, alongside cancellation and postponements of non-essential surgical services, emergency and essential surgical care delivery may become affected due to the shift of human and material resources towards fighting the pandemic. For surgeries that do get carried through, new difficulties arise in protecting surgical personnel from contracting SARS-CoV-2. This scarcity in LMIC surgical ecosystems may result in higher morbidity and mortality, in addition to the COVID-19 toll. This paper aims to explore the potential consequences of COVID-19 on the emergency and essential surgical care in LMICs, to offer recommendations to mitigate damages and to reflect on preparedness for future crises. Reducing the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on LMIC emergency and essential surgical services can be achieved through empowering communities with accurate information and knowledge on prevention, optimizing surgical material resources, providing quality training of health care personnel to treat SARS-CoV-2, and ensuring adequate personal protection equipment for workers on the frontline. While LMIC health systems are under larger strain, the experience from previous outbreaks may aid in order to innovate and adapt to the current pandemic. Protecting LMIC surgical ecosystems will be a pivotal process in ensuring that previous health system strengthening efforts are preserved, comprehensive care for populations worldwide are ensured, and to allow for future developments beyond the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Xiya; Vervoort, Dominique; Reddy, Ch\u00E9 L.; Park, Kee B.; Makasa, Emmanuel","journal":"International journal of surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89b89ead0f4e9be2e36bdad74634b9e28f7ba3d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919120304209; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.05.037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919120304209?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surgical personnel","LMIC surgical ecosystems","essential surgical care delivery","surgical material resources","LMIC emergency","health care systems","LMIC health systems","postponements of non-essential surgical services","comprehensive care","current pandemic","quality training of health care personnel","previous health system","potential consequences of COVID","contracting SARS-CoV","previous outbreaks","devastating consequences","future crises","future developments","knowledge","larger strain","prevention","pivotal process","empowering communities","higher morbidity","significant changes","workers","accurate information","addition","efforts","adequate personal protection equipment","LMICs","middle-income countries","experience","mortality","shift of human","cancellation","important repercussions","frontline","preparedness","recommendations","new difficulties","scarcity","damages","paper","order","toll","populations","surgeries"],"language":"en"},

Methods A working group of stakeholders in health care and transport medicine developed and implemented a medically based command, control, and tracking center for all interfacility (including acute and long-term care) patient transfers in Ontario, Canada. Development and implementation took place in three distinct but overlapping phases: needs assessment, design and implementation, and expansion and ongoing operations. Results The needs assessment, design, and implementation were completed in less than 48 hours using existing EMS infrastructure and personnel. The center was successfully handling more than 500 requests for interfacility patient transfer per day within 36 hours of operation and more than 1,100 requests per day within two weeks. Expansion into a new physical space enables 40 staff to process up to 1,500 requests per day. There was no reported spread of SARS resulting from interfacility patient transfers since the center began operation on April 1, 2003, and anecdotal evidence demonstrates it identified up to 13 new SARS cases. The center continues to operate as a part of Ontario\u0027s commitment as a result of diligence in transport medicine and infection control, even though no new cases of SARS were reported since June 12, 2003. Further study is needed to determine its overall efficacy at risk mitigation. Conclusions Rapid establishment of an EMS-based command, control, and tracking center is possible in the setting of a public health emergency. In addition to risk mitigation, this type of center could provide syndromic surveillance in real time and provide the earliest indication of a potential threat to public health in acute and long-term care facilities.","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacDonald, Russell D.; Farr, Bruce; Neill, Michael; Loch, John; Sawadsky, Bruce; Mazza, Chris; Daya, Karim; Olynyk, Chris; Chad, Sandra","journal":"Prehospital Emergency Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cf851826890b0682af9cf85a9a72baf833e1945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119049.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090312703004349; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090312703004349","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS","SARS"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["tracking center","health care facilities","implementation","health care workers","type of center","result of interfacility patient transfers","public health emergency","long-term care facilities","new SARS cases","new cases of SARS","requests","day","EMS-based command","reported spread of SARS","infection control","risk mitigation","tracking system","transport medicine","rapid development","hours of operation","expansion","design","Canada","needs assessment","risk of iatrogenic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome","existing EMS infrastructure","new physical space","result of diligence","Conclusions Rapid establishment","innovative emergency medical services","potential threat","setting","earliest indication","real time","working group of stakeholders","syndromic surveillance","patients","phases","personnel","place","staff","overall efficacy","Methods","Ontario\u0027s commitment","Abstract Objective","addition","ongoing operations","weeks","anecdotal evidence","study"],"language":"en"},

Objectives This study estimated the burden of both types of pathogens among adults seeking care for an AECOPD during two consecutive winter seasons. Study design Patients 50 years or older who consulted within 10 days of AECOPD onset were eligible. Clinical data were collected on a standardized questionnaire, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), paired sera, and non-induced sputum were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PRC) assays were used to identify viral, atypical and bacterial pathogens in NPA specimen. Results Overall, 108 patients with AECOPD were included, 88% of patients were admitted and 2 patients (2%) received intensive care. A third of patients (31%) had evidence of a viral infection, 9% with influenza A, 7% RSV and 7% with PIV-3. One patient was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 49% of patients with available sputum, most frequently Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. Among virus-infected patients, 14 (58%) also had bacteria in their sputum, but co-infected patients did not present with different symptoms than patients with single infections. Conclusions These results suggest that influenza and RSV are frequent contributors of AECOPD, and that coinfection with bacteria does not appear to be more severe among virus-infected patients. Clinicians should be aware that AECOPD may be frequently triggered by viruses, and may consider antivirals and proper infection control measures in appropriate epidemiological setting.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Serres, Gaston; Lampron, No\u00EBl; La Forge, Jacques; Rouleau, Isabelle; Bourbeau, Jean; Weiss, Karl; Barret, B\u00E9atrice; Boivin, Guy","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a830ae00db01a6f3d3ca1e514f5338aadc3adac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108387.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665320900362X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19665425/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.07.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665320900362X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":["NPA","AECOPD","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-infected patients","co-infected patients","Study design Patients","frequent contributors of AECOPD","days of AECOPD onset","bacterial pathogens","viral infection","available sputum","types of pathogens","RSV","viruses","Results","non-induced sputum","NPA specimen","intensive care","proper infection control measures","acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","paired sera","appropriate epidemiological setting","nasopharyngeal aspirates","Staphylococcus aureus","different symptoms","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","standardized questionnaire","assays","antivirals","Polymerase chain reaction","PRC","contribution","burden","single infections","years","adults","Haemophilus influenzae","consecutive winter seasons","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","studies","coinfection","evidence","Abstract Background","Clinical data","Objectives","Conclusions","Clinicians","PIV"],"language":"en"},

This has resulted in an urgent need to identify antiviral drugs that are active against MERS-CoV. The papain-like protease (PLpro) of MERS-CoV represents an important antiviral target as it is not only essential for viral maturation, but also antagonizes interferon stimulation of the host via its deubiquitination activity. Here, we report the discovery that two SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG), as well as the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid, are able to inhibit MERS-CoV PLpro. Their inhibition mechanisms and mutually binding synergistic effect were also investigated. Our results identify for the first time three inhibitors targeting MERS-CoV PLpro and these can now be used as lead compounds for further antiviral drug development.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Kai-Wen; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Chen, Wei-Yi; Lin, Min-Han; Chuang, Shang-Ju; Cheng, I-Hsin; Sun, Chiao-Yin; Chou, Chi-Yuan","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b1a5519e6f07fdf2c99fb20df015acc450fa631.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113672.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214003623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542975/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214003623; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Jeddah","Saudi Arabia","Middle East","Europe","North Africa"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV PLpro","SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors","antiviral drugs","antiviral drug development","important antiviral target","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid","Jeddah","Europe","pathogenic human coronaviruses","host","interferon stimulation","North Africa","lead compounds","mercaptopurine","time","viral maturation","inhibition mechanisms","synergistic effect","urgent need","countries","protease","discovery","deubiquitination activity","Saudi Arabia","thioguanine","people","fatality rate","papain","TG","results"],"language":"en"},

Although Ghana did not record (and is yet to) any case, and several health workers have received numerous training schemes, there is no record of any study that assessed preparedness of healthcare workers (HCWS) regarding EVD and any emergency prone disease in Ghana. We therefore conducted a hospital based cross sectional study involving 101 HCWs from two facilities in Kumasi, Ghana to assess the level of preparedness of HCWs to respond to any possible EVD. METHODS: We administered a face-to-face questionnaire using an adapted WHO (2015) and CDC (2014) Checklist for Ebola Preparedness and assessed overall knowledge gaps, and preparedness of the Ghanaian HCWs in selected health facilities of the Ashanti Region of Ghana from October to December 2015. RESULTS: A total 92 (91.09%) HCWs indicated they were not adequately trained to handle an EVD suspected case. Only 25.74% (n = 26) considered their facilities sufficiently equipped to handle and manage EVD patients. When asked which disinfectant to use after attending to and caring for a suspected patient with EVD, only 8.91% (n = 9) could correctly identify the right disinfectant (\u03C7(2) = 28.52, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates poor knowledge and ill preparedness and unwillingness of many HCWs to attend to EVD. Beyond knowledge acquisition, there is the need for more training from time to time to fully prepare HCWs to handle any possible EVD case.","publish_time":"2017-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annan, Augustina Angelina; Yar, Denis Dekugmen; Owusu, Michael; Biney, Eno Akua; Forson, Paa Kobina; Okyere, Portia Boakye; Gyimah, Akosua Adumea; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8efe7295a7cf875c8a695df3e87a42e651ce60d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5461762.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4474-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28587602/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola Virus Disease","EVD","CDC","Ebola Preparedness"],"locations":["West Africa","Ghana"],"keyphrases":["EVD patients","possible EVD case","EVD suspected case","Ghanaian HCWs","Ebola Preparedness","ill preparedness","preparedness of healthcare workers","level of preparedness","selected health facilities","line high-risk health workers","need","poor knowledge","knowledge acquisition","time","Ashanti Region of Ghana","record","recent Ebola Virus Disease","disease prevention skills","overall knowledge gaps","emergency prone disease","cross sectional study","suspected patient","right disinfectant","numerous training schemes","epidemic","countries","unwillingness","BACKGROUND","Checklist","Kumasi","West Africa","face-to-face questionnaire","CDC","hospital","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Risk-factors associated with high morbidity were old-age and pre-existing comorbidities. Overwhelming surge of patients facilitates transmission of communicable infections and leads to stress induced physical, mental and compassion fatigue amongst healthcare personnel. Respiratory infections are highly prevalent and easily transmissible during Hajj leading to significant morbidity, increased burden to existing health facilities, overwhelming costs on health systems and globalization of multiresistant pathogens. Diabetic patients should avoid heat exposure and use protective footwear during Hajj rituals. Mass-gathering medicine at Hajj can be optimized by improving patient knowledge on performing Hajj at a younger age, medicine compliance, avoiding self-medication, self-monitoring of hypertension, blood glucose, and preventive health measures; screening of pre-existing comorbidities; and resource augmentation with telemedicine networks and decision-support systems.","publish_time":"2017-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Inam D.; Khan, Shahbaz A.; Asima, Bushra; Hussaini, Syed B.; Zakiuddin, M.; Faisal, F.A.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e17a786d8a26aa0d4d91ec57ed23459801321b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102688.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117301478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28668659/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034117301478; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2017.06.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Indian Medical Mission"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health systems","primary-care clinics","secondary-care hospitals","secondary-care referrals","global health-security","tent-clinics","Secondary-care bed-days","Overwhelming surge of patients","Hajj rituals","Diabetic patients","overwhelming respiratory-infections","Indian Medical Mission extended health-security","static-clinics","medical attendance","Indian pilgrims","Respiratory infections","existing health facilities","preventive health measures","overwhelming costs","tertiary-care Saudi-Arabian hospitals","average bed-occupancy","mass","screening of pre-existing comorbidities","outreach medical teams","transmission of communicable infections","significant morbidity","high morbidity","old-age","younger age","medicine compliance","Outpatient attendance","decision-support systems","blood glucose","increased burden","telemedicine networks","resource augmentation","self-monitoring of hypertension","communication","transportation","sanitation","water","self-medication","food","housing","investigations","compassion fatigue","heat exposure","stress","protective footwear","globalization of multiresistant pathogens","medication usage","crowd-control","healthcare personnel","evacuation capabilities","challenges","Risk-factors","deaths","Crude mortality","patient knowledge","Data","antibacterials","task-forces","Analgesics","trauma","Infectious diseases"],"language":"en"},

The nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is a major structural protein of CoVs, binds to the viral RNA genome to form the virion core and results in the formation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. We have solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HCoV-OC43 N protein (N-NTD) (residues 58 to 195) to a resolution of 2.0\u00C5. The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD is a single domain protein composed of a five-stranded \u03B2-sheet core and a long extended loop, similar to that observed in the structures of N-NTDs from other coronaviruses. The positively charged loop of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contains a structurally well-conserved positively charged residue, R106. To assess the role of R106 in RNA binding, we undertook a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments and docking simulations to characterize the interaction between R106 and RNA. The results show that R106 plays an important role in the interaction between the N protein and RNA. In addition, we showed that, in cells transfected with plasmids that encoded the mutant (R106A) N protein and infected with virus, the level of the matrix protein gene was decreased by 7-fold compared to cells that were transfected with the wild-type N protein. This finding suggests that R106, by enhancing binding of the N protein to viral RNA plays a critical role in the viral replication. The results also indicate that the strength of N protein/RNA interactions is critical for HCoV-OC43 replication.","publish_time":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, I-Jung; Yuann, Jeu-Ming P.; Chang, Yu-Ming; Lin, Shing-Yen; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley; Shen, Yo-Yu; Huang, Tai-Huang; Hou, Ming-Hon","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Proteins and Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64b61cc66756c7a27c061f63d5f0e2788130cd03.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fa8e4804c6eb3cf4d951467f66d17e89af477c91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3774783.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2013.03.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570963913001167; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570963913001167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23501675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OC43 N protein","strength of N protein","HCoV-OC43 N-NTD","structures of N","wild-type N protein","N-terminal domain of HCoV","HCoV-OC43 replication","single domain protein","matrix protein gene","RNA binding","role of R106","RNA interactions","viral RNA genome","major structural protein of CoVs","results","Human coronavirus OC43","critical role","viral replication","important role","cells","virion core","long extended loop","stranded \u03B2-sheet core","formation","level","R106A","causative agent","mutagenesis experiments","ribonucleoprotein","series of site","simulations","mutant","crystal structure","RNP","plasmids","NTDs","complex","fold","coronaviruses","residues","nucleocapsid","resolution","addition"],"language":"en"},

Thus, in the present study, the expression of TGF\u03B2 was analysed both at tissue (lymphoid organs and lung) and serum level to study its correlation with the expression of PRRS virus (PRRSV). To carry out this study, 32 pigs were inoculated with the European PRRSV field isolate 2982 and sequentially killed from 0dpi to the end of the study (24dpi). Blood and tissue samples were collected to determine the expression of PRRSV and TGF\u03B2.

Based on the detailed data of patients released by World Health Organization (WHO) and actual propagation of the epidemic, we construct two dynamical models to simulate the propagation processes from May 20 to June 8 and from June 9 to July 10, 2015, respectively and find that the basic reproduction number R (0) reaches up to 4.422. The numerical analysis shows that the reasons of the outbreak spread quickly are lack of self-protection sense and targeted control measures.

By sensitivity analysis, strengthening self-protection ability of susceptible and quickly isolating or monitoring close contacts are effective measures to control the disease.","publish_time":"2015-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Zhi-Qiang; Zhang, Juan; Xue, Ya-Kui; Sun, Gui-Quan; Jin, Zhen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67466fd44aa1843c57174386e917578f0d83d71a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/40640676ca5aecdde3a40feb137cc3049c14faef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4686901.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26690750/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144778","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["sensitivity analysis","Republic of Korea","numerical analysis","spread of disease","epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome","partial correction analysis","targeted control measures","effective measures","largest outbreak","actual propagation","propagation processes","lack of self-protection sense","asymptomatic infected cases","self-protection ability of susceptible","basic reproduction number R","MERS","World Health Organization","parameters \u03B2","influence","detailed data of patients","proportion","dynamical models","deaths","close contacts","infectivity","strong correlations","reasons","laboratory","public\u2019s attention"],"language":"en"},

We classified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) plaque morphology and analyzed the relationship between plaque morphology as compared to subgroup, viral load and clinical severity of infection in infants and children. METHODS: We obtained respiratory secretions from 149 RSV-infected children. Plaque morphology and viral load was assessed within the first culture passage in HEp-2 cells. Viral load was measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as was RSV subgroup. Disease severity was determined by hospitalization, length of stay, intensive care requirement, and respiratory failure. RESULTS: Plaque morphology varied between individual subjects; however, similar results were observed among viruses collected from upper and lower respiratory tracts of the same subject. Significant differences in plaque morphology were observed between RSV subgroups. No correlations were found among plaque morphology and viral load. Plaque morphology did not correlate with disease severity. CONCLUSION: Plaque morphology measures parameters that are viral-specific and independent of the human host. Morphologies vary between patients and are related to RSV subgroup. In HEp-2 cells, RSV plaque morphology appears unrelated to disease severity in RSV-infected children.

Relatively few studies have been done that link prices of traditional medicine ingredients to what drives changes in price, yet this is an important topic. Theoretically, prices have been widely considered as an economic indicator of resource scarcity. Rare, slow growing medicinal plants sell for high prices and common, less popular species for low prices. Price levels also influence the viability of farming vs. wild harvest (and incentives to overharvest high value species when tenure is weak). Prices can also influence the harvesting or buying behaviour of harvesters, traders or manufacturers. When prices are high, then there is a greater incentive to use cheaper substitute species or adulterants. As previous studies on herbal medicine ingredients have shown, adulteration applies in a wide variety of cases, including to some Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) species. Aim of the study The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of which factors influenced changes in the market prices of document prices for four popular, but very different traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) species (2002 \u2013 2017). Materials and methods Fluctuations in market prices were followed over a 15-year period (2002\u20132017) for four very different TCM ingredients: two plant species (one wild harvested for fruits (Schisandra sphenanthera Rehder \u0026 E.H. Wilson) the other in a transition from wild harvest to cultivation (Paris polyphylla Smith), an animal species (the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko L.)) and the entomophagous \u201Ccaterpillar fungus\u201D (Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk). G.H. Sung, J.M. Sung, Hywel-Jones \u0026 Spatafora). Results High prices of medicinal plants are widely considered to reflect resource scarcity. Real-time market prices for three of the four very different TCM species we studied all showed major price fluctuations. The exception was P. polyphylla, whose wild populations are widely known to be increasingly scarce, where there was a steady increase in price, with few fluctuations in the upward price trend. The three other species showed significant price fluctuations. These were driven by multiple factors. Ecological and biogeographic factors that influence abundance or scarcity of supply certainly played a role. But other factors were also influential. These included both national and global economic factors (the influence of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)), national policy changes that in turn influenced businessmen giving expensive gifts (that included O. sinensis)), climate change (influencing fruiting success of S. sphenanthera), price speculation by traders and lack of information (e.g: reduction in G. gecko prices due to traders incorrectly believing that domestication would increase supplies). Conclusions Price fluctuations in the four TCM species we examined are influenced by many factors and not just resource scarcity. And the situation is more complex than the trajectory based on Homma\u0027s (1992) model, where he predicted that higher prices would result in a shift to cultivation, thus replacing wild harvest. In case of both O. sinensis and P. polyphylla, Homma (1992, 1996) was right in terms of scarcity and high prices stimulating a major investment in cultivation (P. polyphylla) and artificial production (O. sinensis). But in both cases, intensive production through cultivation or artificial propagation do not yet occur on a large enough scale to reduce harvest of wild stocks. Substitution and adulteration occur with all four species. Improving information to medicinal plant traders on the supply status of TCM stocks, whether from wild harvest or from cultivation could benefit product quality, cultivation initiatives and conservation efforts.","publish_time":"2019-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunningham, A.

The A(H1N1)pdm09 infection had several unique characteristics which included rapid transmissibility and high morbidity in obese individuals, pregnant women and individuals suffering from chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: To study the relationships between A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection and infections with other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumo virus (hMPV), adenovirus and seasonal influenza. METHODS: Samples (nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates) collected between 2007 until 2012 from patients of various ages that were hospitalized due to respiratory virus infections were analyzed for the presence of various respiratory viruses, using qRT\u2010PCR. RESULTS: In 2009\u20132010, when the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 first appeared, two major infection peaks were noted and individuals of various ages were infected. Following the decline of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, the percentages of patients infected with adenovirus and hMPV increased, while infection frequency with RSV B and with seasonal influenza virus decreased. Furthermore, RSV infections were delayed and very few percentages of patients were co\u2010infected with more than one virus. Interestingly, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus lost its dominancy when it reappeared in the winter of 2010\u20132011, and at this time, only the incidence of RSV infections was affected by the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

The increasing availability of HBV/C genetic sequences and detailed annotations provides an opportunity to investigate the epidemiological factors underlying its evolutionary history. In this study, the Bayesian phylogeography framework was used to investigate the origins and patterns in spatial dissemination of HBV/C by analyzing East Asian sequences obtained from 1992 to 2010. The most recent common ancestor of HBV/C was traced back to the early 1900s in China, where it eventually diverged into two major lineages during the 1930s\u20101960s that gave rise to distinct epidemic waves spreading exponentially to other East Asian countries and the USA. Demographic inference of viral effective population size over time indicated similar dynamics for both lineages, characterized by exponential growth since the early 1980s, followed by a significant bottleneck in 2003 and another increase after 2004. Although additional factors cannot be ruled out, we provide evidence to suggest this bottleneck was the result of limited human movement from/to China during the SARS outbreak in 2003.

In this work we hypothesized that essential oil components may interact with key protein targets of the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A molecular docking analysis was carried out using 171 essential oil components with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), SARS-CoV-2 endoribonucleoase (SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/NendoU), SARS-CoV-2 ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase (SARS-CoV-2 ADRP), SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (SARS-CoV-2 RdRp), the binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 rS), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2). The compound with the best normalized docking score to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (E)-\u03B2-farnesene. The best docking ligands for SARS-CoV Nsp15/NendoU were (E,E)-\u03B1-farnesene, (E)-\u03B2-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol. (E,E)-Farnesol showed the most exothermic docking to SARS-CoV-2 ADRP. Unfortunately, the docking energies of (E,E)-\u03B1-farnesene, (E)-\u03B2-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol with SARS-CoV-2 targets were relatively weak compared to docking energies with other proteins and are, therefore, unlikely to interact with the virus targets.

METHODS: In the present study, we developed a triplex quantitative real-time PCR assay (tq-PCR) in a single closed tube for differential detection and quantitative analysis of HAdV serotypes 2, 3 and 7. The sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and clinical performance of tq-PCR were evaluated.

To discriminate between primary infections and secondary infections associated with the virus intercellular movement, a gene cassette expressing GFP-HDEL was inserted adjacent to a TuMV infectious cassette expressing 6K(2):mCherry, both within the T-DNA borders of the binary vector pCambia. In this system, both gene cassettes were delivered to the same cell by a single binary vector and primary infection foci emitted green and red fluorescence while secondarily infected cells emitted only red fluorescence. Intercellular movement was measured at 72 hours post infiltration and was estimated to proceed at an average rate of one cell being infected every three hours over an observation period of 17 hours. To determine if the secretory pathway were important for TuMV intercellular movement, chemical and protein inhibitors that blocked both early and late secretory pathways were used. Treatment with Brefeldin A or Concanamycin A or expression of ARF1 or RAB-E1d dominant negative mutants, all of which inhibit pre- or post-Golgi transport, reduced intercellular movement by the virus. These treatments, however, did not inhibit virus replication in primary infected cells. Pharmacological interference assays using Tyrphostin A23 or Wortmannin showed that endocytosis was not important for TuMV intercellular movement. Lack of co-localization by endocytosed FM4-64 and Ara7 (AtRabF2b) with TuMV-induced 6K(2)-tagged vesicles further supported this conclusion. Microfilament depolymerizing drugs and silencing expression of myosin XI-2 gene, but not myosin VIII genes, also inhibited TuMV intercellular movement. Expression of dominant negative myosin mutants confirmed the role played by myosin XI-2 as well as by myosin XI-K in TuMV intercellular movement. Using this dual gene cassette expression system and transport inhibitors, components of the secretory and actomyosin machinery were shown to be important for TuMV intercellular spread.","publish_time":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agbeci, Maxime; Grangeon, Romain; Nelson, Richard S.; Zheng, Huanquan; Lalibert\u00E9, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a49651276ae7cd5bf402c1066944fb7cfc83ffaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3789768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098128/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003683","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tyrphostin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TuMV intercellular movement","virus intercellular movement","TuMV intercellular spread","intercellular movement of turnip mosaic virus","TuMV infectious cassette","silencing expression of myosin XI","Expression of dominant negative myosin mutants","hours","dual gene cassette expression system","primary infected cells","transport inhibitors","expression of ARF1","primary infections","gene cassettes","virus replication","red fluorescence","primary infection foci","post-Golgi transport","contribution of different host cell transport systems","single binary vector","binary vector pCambia","late secretory pathways","RAB-E1d dominant negative mutants","protein inhibitors","secondary infections","components","Tyrphostin A23","Wortmannin","endocytosis","role","endocytosed FM4","Microfilament depolymerizing drugs","GFP-HDEL","Pharmacological interference assays","T-DNA borders","genes","Lack of co-localization","Concanamycin","Ara7","actomyosin machinery","Brefeldin","AtRabF2b","observation period","average rate","vesicles","conclusion","mCherry","infiltration","treatments"],"language":"en"},

Bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of hospital admission in children less than 1 year of age. The incidence is estimated to be about 150\u00B0 million cases a year worldwide, and 2\u20133% of these cases require hospitalization. It is acknowledged that viruses cause bronchiolitis, but most of the studies focus on RSV. The RSV causes a more severe form of bronchiolitis in children with risk factors including prematurity, cardiovascular disease and immunodeficiency. Other viruses involved in causing bronchiolitis include RV, hMPV, hBoV and co-infections. The RV seems to be associated with a less severe acute disease, but there is a correlation between the early infection and subsequent wheezing bronchitis and asthma in later childhood and adulthood. The supportive therapies used are intravenous fluids and oxygen supplement administered by nasal cannula or CPAP in most complicated patients. Additional pharmacological therapies include epinephrine, 3% hypertonic saline and corticosteroids. The Epinephrine seems to have the greatest short-term benefits and reduces the need of hospital admission, whereas hypertonic saline and corticosteroids seem to reduce the length of hospital stay. As bronchiolitis is such a prevalent disease in children and RV seems to play an important role, perhaps more studies should center around the RV\u0027s contribution to the initial disease and following pathology.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicolai, A.; Ferrara, M.; Schiavariello, C.; Gentile, F.; Grande, M.

A single metagenomics analysis has the potential to detect rare and novel pathogens, and to uncover the role of dysbiotic microbiomes in infectious and chronic human disease. Making use of advances in sequencing platforms and bioinformatics tools, recent studies have shown that metagenomics can even determine the whole-genome sequences of pathogens, allowing inferences about antibiotic resistance, virulence, evolution and transmission to be made. We are entering an era in which more novel infectious diseases will be identified through metagenomics-based methods than through traditional laboratory methods.

Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts\u002B variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1, located within antigenic site 1. The is phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site. Virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the is variants was either ts\u002B or cold sensitive, and had become more neurovirulent.

Stem Cell transplantation is used for the treatment for a wide variety of diseases, including leukemia and lymphoma. PURPOSE: This study highlights prevention strategies of infectious diseases among HSCT donors and recipients in our institute as guided by International guidelines. We aim to highlight the strategy for extensive screening of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis cases in all the stem cell units stored in our facility METHODS: We searched the institutional database to identify cases of infectious diseases among HSC transplants. Extensive donor evaluation was conducted through screening and laboratory infectious disease testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis. RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2014, 263 consecutive adult HSCT were performed. An approximate equal number of autologous and allogeneic HSC collections were undertaken. The median age for autologous donors was 35 years, whereas that of allogeneic donors is 25 years. Of the 263 stem cell donors, we found 18 patients (autologous) and 2 donors (allogeneic) to be infected. We did not find any of the donors infected with HIV by the serology as well as the NAT testing protocol CONCLUSION: Donor screening and testing is the most critical parameter in stem cell transplantation in order to ensure the safety of the product to be transplanted. Modifications in the regulations related to donor screening are aimed at providing safe transplantation and negate the risk of accidental infection of the donor.","publish_time":"2015-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsuhaibani, Omar; Pereira, Winston Costa; Tareeqanwar, Mohammed; Khizzi, Nora El; Bakheswain, Saadia; Shaker, Amira; Elyamany, Ghaleb","journal":"Ann Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/096c2c85e046f4ebb34552e0a21bcd69907d1b81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4480260.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26130912/; https://doi.org/10.5214/ans.0972.7531.220206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","NAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stem cell donors","Donor screening","HSCT donors","autologous donors","allogeneic donors","Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","stem cell units","extensive screening of HIV","suitable donor","cases of infectious diseases","Extensive donor evaluation","CMV infection","safe transplantation","infusion of hematopoietic stem cells","Hepatitis B","laboratory infectious disease testing","syphilis cases","allogeneic HSC collections","years","study highlights prevention strategies of infectious diseases","wide variety of diseases","risk of accidental infection","consecutive adult HSCT","NAT testing protocol CONCLUSION","approximate equal number of autologous","HSC transplants","critical parameter","facility METHODS","institutional database","institute","treatment","order","recipients","PURPOSE","leukemia","serology","BACKGROUND","patients","median age","safety","regulations","strategy","International guidelines","lymphoma","Modifications","RESULTS","product","chemotherapy"],"language":"en"},

We identified two variants that segregate in both humans and chimpanzees; one of them (rs3735007) does not occur at a hypermutable site and accounts for a nonsynonymous substitution (Thr851Ile). The probability that the two trans-specific polymorphisms have occurred independently in the two lineages was estimated to be low (P = 0.0054), suggesting that at least one of them has arisen before speciation and has been maintained by selection. Population genetic analyses in humans indicated that the region surrounding the shared variants displays strong evidences of long-standing balancing selection. Selection signatures were also observed in a chimpanzee population sample. Inspection of 1000 Genomes data confirmed these findings but indicated that search for selection signatures using low-coverage whole-genome data may need masking of repetitive sequences. A case\u2013control study of more than 1,000 individuals from mainland Italy indicated that the Thr851Ile SNP is significantly associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.08\u20131.99, P = 0.011). This finding was confirmed in a larger sample of 4,416 Sardinians cases/controls (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.037\u20131.344, P = 0.011), but not in a population from Belgium. We provide one of the first instances of human/chimpanzee trans-specific coding variant located outside the major histocompatibility complex region. The selective pressure is likely to be virus driven; in modern populations, this variant associates with susceptibility to MS, possibly via the interaction with environmental factors.","publish_time":"2012-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cagliani, R.; Guerini, F.

Coupled with phenotypic plasticity of many species and inconclusive taxonomic keys, species identification using only morphological traits can be challenging. In this study, a microarray assay with associated PCR of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was developed for differentiation of 14 bat species submitted to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency from 1985\u20132012 for rabies diagnosis. The assay was validated with a reference collection of DNA from 153 field samples, all of which had been barcoded previously. The COI gene from 152 samples which included multiple specimens of each target species were successfully amplified by PCR and accurately identified by the microarray. One sample that was severely decomposed failed to amplify with PCR primers developed in this study, but amplified weakly after switching to alternate primers and was accurately typed by the microarray. Thus, the chiropteran microarray was able to accurately differentiate between the 14 species of Canadian bats targeted. This PCR and microarray assay would allow unequivocal identification to species of most, if not all, bat specimens submitted for rabies diagnosis in Canada.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lung, Oliver; Nadin-Davis, Susan; Fisher, Mathew; Erickson, Anthony; Knowles, M.

METHODS: Articles pertaining to filovirus transmission and personal protective equipment in filovirus outbreaks were reviewed and are presented. Additionally, studies evaluating PPE as well as donning and doffing strategies are also presented. FINDINGS: Personal Protective equipment is one step in a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy that is required to protect healthcare providers. Given that the Ebola virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact of mucous membranes and cuts in the skin with infected patients and/or their bodily fluids, it is necessary to cover these potential portals of infection with PPE as part of a structured and instructed donning and doffing procedure. IMPLICATIONS: Current recommendations about PPE and the donning and doffing processes are based on anecdotal experience. However the use of non-human viruses can help provide evidence based guidelines on both PPE and processes.","publish_time":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, William A.; Weber, David; Wohl, David A.","journal":"Clinical Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/289deae0b2050aa259a05ba84565a4df82fa099a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4661082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26452427/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291815009352; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.07.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291815009352; http://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149291815009352/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["PPE","Ebola virus transmission","personal protective equipment","filovirus transmission","infection healthcare providers","nosocomial transmission","doffing strategies","doffing processes","current Ebola epidemic","instructed donning","doffing procedure","improved understanding of pathogen transmission","comprehensive infection prevention","potential portals of infection","filovirus outbreaks","institution of strategies","Current recommendations","infected patients","infectious disease outbreak","cuts","step","direct contact of mucous membranes","skin","evidence","control strategy","use of non-human viruses","West Africa","guidelines","Articles","bodily fluids","anecdotal experience","PURPOSE","IMPLICATIONS","METHODS","FINDINGS","history","studies","review"],"language":"en"},

Since the first reports of its existence in Africa in the 1950s, more than 1500 scientific publications on the different aspects of the disease and its causative agent have been produced. Analysis of these publications shows that, following a number of studies in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the absence of autochthonous cases in developed countries, the interest of the scientific community remained low. However, in 2005 chikungunya fever unexpectedly re-emerged in the form of devastating epidemics in and around the Indian Ocean. These outbreaks were associated with mutations in the viral genome that facilitated the replication of the virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.

The results showed that TGEV infection induced ROS accumulation, whereas UV-irradiated TGEV did not promote ROS accumulation. In addition, TGEV infection lowered mitochondrial transmembrane potential in PK-15 cell line, which could be inhibited by ROS scavengers, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). Furthermore, the two scavengers significantly inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 and further blocked apoptosis occurrence through suppressing the TGEV-induced Bcl-2 reduction, Bax redistribution, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation.

The Arabian Peninsula is considered a major global epicentre for the disease and the virus has crossed regional and continental boundaries since 2012. In this study, we focused on exploring the temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV in human populations in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2017, using publicly available data on case counts and combining two analytical methods. Disease progression was assessed by quantifying the time-dependent reproductive number (TD-Rs), while case series temporal pattern was modelled using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We accounted for geographical variability between three major affected regions in Saudi Arabia including Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah. In Saudi Arabia, the epidemic size was large with TD-Rs \u003E1, indicating significant spread until 2017. In both Makkah and Riyadh regions, the epidemic progression reached its peak in April 2014 (TD-Rs \u003E 7), during the highest incidence period of MERS-CoV cases. In Eastern Province, one unique super-spreading event (TD-R \u003E 10) was identified in May 2013, which comprised of the most notable cases of human-to-human transmission. Best-fitting ARIMA model inferred statistically significant biannual seasonality in Riyadh region, a region characterised by heavy seasonal camel-related activities. However, no statistical evidence of seasonality was identified in Eastern Province and Makkah. Instead, both areas were marked by an endemic pattern of cases with sporadic outbreaks. Our study suggested new insights into the epidemiology of the virus, including inferences about epidemic progression and evidence for seasonality. Despite the inherent limitations of the available data, our conclusions provide further guidance to currently implement risk-based surveillance in high-risk populations and, subsequently, improve related interventions strategies against the epidemic at country and regional levels.","publish_time":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alkhamis, M.

Objective Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) of viral origin are a frequent cause of pediatric consultations and hospital admissions. The aim of this study was to investigate the etiology of these infections in Gran Canaria, the Canary Islands, (Spain). Methods From May 2002 through May 2005, 1957 nasopharyngeal washings were collected from 1729 children presenting with ARTI to the Pediatric Emergency Unit. A rapid antigen detection method was performed in every sample to identify respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). An immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and cell culture (CC) was used in RSV-negative samples. Results Median age was 2 months (range, 0.03-119). A viral agent was identified in 1032 children (59.7%). RSV was detected in 769 children (74.5%). Other viruses identified, in order of frequency, were parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses. Statistical differences were found between age and the type of virus detected: Adenoviruses caused respiratory infections in older children (median age: 6 months; range: 1-74). There were 6 mixed infections. Sensitivity of IFA as compared to CC was 55.8%, and specificity was 99.2%. Conclusions Respiratory viruses are responsible for a large number of ARTI cases in children from Gran Canaria, RSV being the major cause. Viral identification is determinant for managing these patients and making a proper use of antibacterial and antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2006-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Artiles-Campelo, Fernando; del Carmen P\u00E9rez-Gonz\u00E1lez, Mar\u00EDa; Caballero-Hidalgo, Araceli; Pena-L\u00F3pez, Mar\u00EDa J.","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1951cbe2ddd496f0b785a8c3edde16cb9bd6a206.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X06738587; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X06738587","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Objective Acute"],"organizations":["VRS","rapid"],"locations":["Gran Canaria","Canary","Spain"],"keyphrases":["RSV was detected in","age was","The aim of","and specificity was","was used in RSV","virus parainfluenza","in order of frequency","the etiology of these infections in Gran Canaria","study was","virus respiratorios","viral agent was identified in","of viral origin","were found between age and the type of virus detected","and cell","of antibacterial and antiviral drugs","virus respiratorio sincitial","Adenoviruses caused respiratory infections in older children","of pediatric consultations and hospital admissions","identify respiratory syncytial virus","responsible for a large number of ARTI cases in children from Gran Canaria","tipo de virus detectado","dem\u00E1s virus identificados","RSV being the major","were parainfluenza","VRS","Sensitivity of IFA as compared","the Canary Islands","rapid antigen detection method was performed in every sample","children presenting with ARTI","the Pediatric Emergency Unit","mixed infections","Conclusions Respiratory","There were","ni\u00F1os atendidos","mediana de edad","Objective Acute respiratory tract infections","determinant for managing these patients and making a proper","nasopharyngeal washings were collected from","Methods From May","Viral identification","mayor edad","months","objetivo","range","intervalo","through May","responsables de cuadros","dichas infecciones","cuadro respiratorio","infecciones respiratorias agudas","alto n\u00FAmero de casos","casos de infecci\u00F3n mixta","frequent","detecci\u00F3n de ant\u00EDgeno","causa frecuente","origen v\u00EDrico","Urgencias","inmunofluorescencia","s\u00EDntomas compatibles","orden de frecuencia","Statistical","An immunofluorescence assay","t\u00E9cnica r\u00E1pida","tratamiento cl\u00EDnico","empleo adecuado","pacientes","hospitalizaci\u00F3n pedi\u00E1trica","etiolog\u00EDa","gripe","Other","negative","rinovirus","lavados nasofar\u00EDngeos","agente causal","identificaci\u00F3n","resultado negativo","cultivo celular","estudio","Spain","enterovirus","Conclusiones","Results","coronavirus","muestras","sensibilidad","relaci\u00F3n","diferencias","Resultados","M\u00E9todos","especificidad"],"language":"es"},

At 16 \u03BC/ml, the turkey peptide THP3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of Bordetella avium, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella typhimurium, while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less. This peptide, THP3, does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides. Under our experimental conditions, none of the peptides neutralized Infectious Bronchitis Virus, an enveloped coronavirus of chickens.","publish_time":"1995-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evans, Ellen W.; Beach, F.Gwen; Moore, Kristi M.; Jackwood, Mark W.; Glisson, John R.; Harmon, Barry G.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9a5a78e6dad2131eede27d8532d1c41ad86dc32.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0378113595001263; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378113595001263","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Turkey Heterophil Peptides"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["avian peptides","Turkey Heterophil Peptides","Chicken Heterophil Peptides","avian heterophil antimicrobial cationic peptides","turkey peptide THP3","maximum peptide concentration","selected avian pathogens","known antimicrobial peptide protamine","reduction","\u03BCg","survival of Bordetella avium","survival of Candida albicans","survival of Pasteurella multocida","human pathogens","Salmonella enteriditis","Salmonella typhimurium","Escherichia coli","Infectious Bronchitis Virus","microbicidal activity","enveloped coronavirus of chickens","positive control","Campylobacter jejuni","homologous amino acid sequence","birds","experimental conditions","concentrations"],"language":"en"},

It was hypothesized that MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 may function as biological markers to assess disease severity in viral lower respiratory tract infections in children. MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and granulocytes obtained in both the acute and recovery phase from 153 children with mild, moderate, and severe viral lower respiratory tract infections were determined using real\u2010time PCR. In addition, MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 concentrations in blood and nasopharyngeal specimens were determined during acute mild, moderate, and severe infection, and after recovery using ELISA. Furthermore, PBMCs and neutrophils obtained from healthy volunteers were stimulated with RSV, LPS (TLR4 agonist), and Pam3Cys (TLR2 agonist) in vitro. Disease severity of viral lower respiratory tract infections in children is associated with increased expression levels of the MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 genes in both PBMCs and granulocytes. On the contrary, in vitro experiments showed that MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs and granulocytes is not induced by stimulation with RSV, the most frequent detected virus in young children with viral lower respiratory tract infections. These data indicate that expression levels of the MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 genes in both PBMCs and neutrophils are associated with viral lower respiratory tract infections disease severity. These observations justify future validation in independent prospective study cohorts of the usefulness of MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 as potential markers for disease severity in viral respiratory infections.

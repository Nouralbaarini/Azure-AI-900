Here, we expressed the HPV16 E6 antigen on Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) and investigated E6-specific CMI following oral administration of the L. casei-PgsA-E6 to mice. Surface expression of HPV16 E6 antigens was confirmed and mice were orally inoculated with the L. casei-PgsA or the L. casei-PgsA-E6. Compared to the L. casei-PgsA-treated mice, significantly higher levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA were observed in L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice; these differences were significantly enhanced after boost. Consistent with this, systemic and local CMI were significantly increased after the boost, as shown by increased counts of IFN-\u03B3-secreting cells in splenocytes, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and vaginal samples. Furthermore, in the TC-1 tumor model, animals receiving the orally administered L. casei-PgsA-E6 showed reduced tumor size and increased survival rate versus mice receiving control (L. casei-PgsA) immunization. We also found that L. casei-PgsA-E6-induced antitumor effect was decreased by in vivo depletion of CD4(\u002B) or CD8(\u002B) T cells. Collectively, these results indicate that the oral administration of lactobacilli bearing the surface-displayed E6 protein induces T cell-mediated cellular immunity and antitumor effects in mice.","publish_time":"2010-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Tae-Young; Kim, Yang-Hyun; Lee, Kyung-Soon; Kim, Jeong-Ki; Lee, Il-Han; Yang, Jai-Myung; Sung, Moon-Hee; Park, Jong-Sup; Poo, Haryoung","journal":"Cancer Immunol Immunother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcd41f49e07917307a078489eb212c4b1c3a201b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20706715/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-010-0903-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["L. casei-PgsA-E6"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["casei-PgsA","HPV16 E6 protein","E6-immunized mice","eradication of HPV16 E6","Lactobacillus casei","investigated E6-specific CMI","Surface expression of HPV16 E6 antigens","treated mice","cancer cells","local CMI","T cells","local cell-mediated immunity","boost","mucosal immunotherapy of cervical cancer","\u03B3-secreting cells","increased survival rate","oral administration of lactobacilli","increased counts of IFN","cellular immunity","cervical mucosa","mucosal IgA","tumor model","antitumor effects","reduced tumor size","splenocytes","higher levels of serum IgG","MLN","mesenteric lymph nodes","target","human papillomavirus type","control","animals","differences","TC","CD8","vaginal samples","depletion of CD4","results","immunization"],"language":"en"},

Abstract This commentary, on Heine and Quintavalla\u2019s article Priorities and Human Rights, considers the authors\u2019 position that, while the right to life and other civil and political rights are equally as important as health and other social rights, some degree of prioritizing types of rights is necessary because all rights cannot be implemented simultaneously. This commentary concurs with Heine and Quintavalla\u2019s challenge to the common argument that civil and political rights are of higher importance [1-3]. But this commentary goes further, in suggesting that before a society begins to prioritize implementation of human rights, it must first secure the basic understanding that the right to health is indeed equally important to civil and political rights. This commentary uses the example of national courts to show how judicial engagement with the right to health has begun to chip away at the boundary between the categories of rights. It suggests that greater interconnection among health and other rights has also made mapping out a hierarchical relationship far more difficult. Thus, before implementation can have any defined order, states must first come to a shared understanding regarding the equal if not greater importance of the right to health.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uberoi, Diya; Forman, Lisa","journal":"Ethics Med Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8752ca68cec7e4418fe8919d70525b08cb97996.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352552520300542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352552520300542?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Heine"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["other rights","political rights","droits civils","\u0153uvre des droits","the example","while the","Human Rights","types de droits","droits sociaux","cat\u00E9gories de droits","sant\u00E9","other social rights","to health is indeed equally important to civil","Quintavalla\u2019s challenge to the common argument that civil","considers the authors","it must first secure the basic understanding that the","judicial engagement with the","begun to chip away at the boundary between the categories","commentaire","must first come to","begins to prioritize implementation","rights is necessary because","position that","national courts to show","other civil","This commentary concurs with Heine","article de Heine","greater importance","Abstract This commentary","importance sup\u00E9rieure","politiques","faveur du droit","shared understanding regarding the equal if","equally as important as health","rights cannot be implemented simultaneously","importance \u00E9gale","higher importance","It suggests that greater interconnection among health","in suggesting that before","But this commentary goes further","abord","homme","mise","before implementation can","Quintavalla\u2019s article Priorities","prioritizing types","argument commun","engagement judiciaire","Quintavalla intitul\u00E9","position des auteurs","mapping out","any defined order","also","some degree","hierarchical relationship far more difficult","Priorit\u00E9s","Thus","ordre d\u00E9fini","exemple des tribunaux nationaux","compr\u00E9hension commune","certaine mesure","\u00E9tablissement","relation hi\u00E9rarchique","\u00C9tats","contestation","fronti\u00E8re","vie","grande interconnexion","soci\u00E9t\u00E9","R\u00E9sum\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

Presently, pharmacological research reports are available on only few species namely Bituminaria bituminosa (Syn: P. bituminosa), P. canescens, P. corylifolia, P. esculenta, P. plicata and P. glandulosa which are valued for their chemical constituents and traditional uses. Aim of the review This review article provides explicit information on traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of selected Psoralea species. The possible trends and perspectives for future research on these plants are also discussed. Materials and methods An extensive and systematic review of the extant literature was carried out, and the data under various sections were identified using a computerized bibliographic search via the PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, EMBASE, INMEDPLAN, NATTS as well as several websites. Key findings A total of 291 bioactive compounds from 06 species of genus Psoralea have been isolated and characterized. However, P. bituminosa alone possess nearly 150 compounds. These bioactive compounds belong to different chemical classes, including flavonoids, coumarins, furanocoumarins, chalcones, quinines, terpenoids and some others due to which these species exhibit significant anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-helmintic, anti-diabetic, diuretic, hepatoprotective, anti-cancer and anti-tumor activities. P. corylifolia L. (Babchi), a Chinese traditional medicinal plant has been used in traditional medicine for many decades for its healing properties against numerous skin diseases such as leprosy, psoriasis and leucoderma. Conclusions The in vitro studies and in vivo models have provided a simple bio-scientific justification for various ethnopharmacological uses of Psoralea species. From the toxicological perspective, the root, leaf, and seed extracts and their preparations have been proven to be safe when consumed in the recommended doses. But, meticulous studies on the pharmaceutical standardization, mode of action of the active constituents, and sustainable conservation of Psoralea species are needed, to meet the growing demands of the pharmaceutical industries, and to fully exploit their preventive and therapeutic potentials.","publish_time":"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koul, Bhupendra; Taak, Pooja; Kumar, Arvind; Kumar, Anil; Sanyal, Indraneel","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e888985a66c69031003933c33f92352a8c76ad0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127090.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874118313783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521980/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.11.036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874118313783","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P. corylifolia L."],"organizations":["Psoralea","Google Scholar"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["species of genus Psoralea","anti-diabetic","anti-helmintic","anti-cancer","accepted species","anti-tumor activities","sustainable conservation of Psoralea species","traditional uses","pharmacological activities of selected Psoralea species","significant anti-oxidant","traditional medicine","bioactive compounds","leprosy","various ethnopharmacological","systematic review","psoriasis","review article","chemical constituents","Chinese traditional medicinal plant","leucoderma","Bituminaria bituminosa","corylifolia","pharmacological research reports","various sections","active constituents","future research","pharmaceutical standardization","pharmaceutical industries","meticulous studies","medicinal practitioners of China","different chemical classes","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance","MEDLINE","phytochemistry","Fabaceae","explicit information","hepatoprotective","diuretic","CAB Abstracts","Google Scholar","PubMed","Web of Science","tuberculosis","flavonoids","numerous skin diseases","kidney problems","healing properties","simple bio-scientific justification","mode of action","treatment of tooth decay","root","leaf","furanocoumarins","chalcones","indigestion","EMBASE","countries","perspectives","India","decades","harbours","computerized bibliographic search","local peoples","seed extracts","NATTS","quinines","constipation","INMEDPLAN","models","possible trends","methods","total","Babchi","Syn","extant literature","Key findings","preparations","toxicological perspective","terpenoids","impotence","Materials","esculenta","plicata","growing demands"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients. RESULTS Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers (p\u003C0.05), with r-values of \u22120.446 and \u22120.780, respectively. CONCLUSION Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, K.; Kang, S.; Tian, R.; Zhang, X.; Wang, Y.","journal":"Clinical Radiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7da9d884b518fd74b710bf5e3e1ddeb1ff5e50d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32216961/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000992602030088X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000992602030088X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["cases","RESULTS Chest CT","CT results","stage of abnormal shadows","CONCLUSION Spiral CT","radiological characteristics of patients","SPO2","severity of chest infection","abnormal lung shadows","common stage","progressing stage","lesion distribution","patchy shadows","lesion morphology","presence of chest computed tomography","lymphocyte ratio","lymphocyte numbers","negative correlation","confirmed COVID","imaging data","peripheral zone","central zone","Xiaogan Hospital","multi-lobe lesions","blood oxygen saturation","abnormalities","location","METHODS","lungs","sensitive examination method","evaluation of progression","accuracy","density","diagnostic sensitivity","early diagnosis","MATERIALS","Hubei","ground-glass opacity","nucleic acid detection","types of changes","China","consolidation change","r-values","large areas"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetically, CHM2013 is closely related to the vaccine strain SM98 whereas the isolate BJ2011C belongs to the GIIb group, a cluster that contains many recent pandemic strains. The full-length cDNA clones of the two isolates were constructed into BAC under the control of CMV promoter. The rescued viruses rBJ2011C and rCHM2013 were found to replicate at the kinetics similar to their respective parental viruses in cell culture. When tested in the 2-day-old pig model, rBJ2011C caused severe diarrhea of piglets with extensive damages to the intestinal epithelium, leading to 100% fatality within 48 hours. In contrast, the rCHM2013-inoculated piglets all survived with only very minor tissue damage observed. Thus, we have successfully established a convenient platform for PEDV genome manipulation.

This study reviews the relatively new drug safety surveillance system in China and compares it with the systems in the United States and Europe. Methods An extensive literature review was conducted in the following four areas: 1) the organizational structure of the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) in China; 2) the development of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) monitoring system in China; 3) regulatory issues related to drug safety in China; and 4) similarities and differences between drug safety surveillance in China and surveillance in the United States and Europe. Results The SFDA oversees an extensive network of drug safety \u201Cwatchdogs,\u201D including the China National Center for ADR Monitoring and 32 regional centers throughout China. China\u0027s system has faced a number of recent challenges. It has had to respond quickly to the withdrawal of various high-profile drugs like Vioxx (rofecoxib) and Baycol (cerivastatin) from other markets. Together with China\u0027s Ministry of Health, the SFDA has faced several unique drug safety events. Three of those events, involving the injectable form of the heartleaf houttuyinia herb (Yu Xing Cao), Armillarisni A injections, and clindamycin glucose infusions (Xinfu), are discussed. The rapid development of drug safety surveillance in China is manifested in extensive organizational structure, development of large databases, and laws and regulations supporting drug safety. The two major laws are the China Drug Administration Law issued in February 2001 and the Regulation for the Administration of ADR Reporting and Monitoring issued in March 2004. The study also discusses and compares recent developments in drug safety surveillance in the United States and the European Union. These developments will most likely have implications for the Chinese system in the near future. Conclusions While postmarketing surveillance guidelines are not yet available in China, we fully expect their eventual issuance after adaptation to the particular culture and clinical practices in China.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Wenmin; Guo, Jeff J.; Jing, Yonghua; Li, Xing; Kelton, Christina M.L.","journal":"Value in Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/164b052f51fac87145a66b4182f9a451442b9c7c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00377.x; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301510606572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18387057/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301510606572","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Yu Xing Cao"],"organizations":["Abstract Objectives Drug","State Food and Drug Administration","SFDA","Ministry of Health"],"locations":["United States","China","Europe","European Union"],"keyphrases":["China Drug Administration Law","new drug safety surveillance system","rapid development of drug safety surveillance","extensive network of drug safety","unique drug safety events","Abstract Objectives Drug safety","adverse drug reaction","China National Center","monitoring system","postmarketing surveillance guidelines","ADR Monitoring","SFDA","United States","China\u0027s system","Chinese system","extensive organizational structure","Administration of ADR Reporting","recent developments","study","development of large databases","extensive literature review","China\u0027s Ministry of Health","important public health issues","major laws","regulatory issues","number of recent challenges","heartleaf houttuyinia herb","Yu Xing Cao","particular culture","rofecoxib","Vioxx","injections","Armillarisni","State Food","watchdogs","adaptation","injectable form","withdrawal of various high-profile drugs","regulations","clindamycin glucose infusions","similarities","differences","clinical practices","regional centers","Baycol","eventual issuance","systems","cerivastatin","Xinfu","Methods","near future","areas","implications","European Union","Conclusions","markets"],"language":"en"},

The building sector is considered to be the largest world energy consumer, so many global organizations are attempting to create a sustainable environment in building construction by reducing energy consumption. Therefore, maintaining high standards of hygiene while reducing energy consumption has become a major task for hospitals. This study develops a decision model based on genetic algorithms and A* graph search algorithms to evaluate existing hospital environmental conditions and to recommend an optimal scheme of sustainable renovation strategies, considering trade-offs among minimal renovation cost, maximum quality improvement, and low environmental impact. Reusing vacant buildings is a global and sustainable trend. In Taiwan, for example, more and more school space will be unoccupied due to a rapidly declining birth rate. Integrating medical care with local community elder-care efforts becomes important because of the aging population. This research introduces a model that converts a simulated vacant school building into a community public hospital renovation project in order to validate the solutions made by hospital managers and suggested by the system. The result reveals that the system performs well and its solutions are more successful than the actions undertaken by decision-makers. This system can improve traditional hospital building condition assessment while making it more effective and efficient.","publish_time":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juan, Yi-Kai; Cheng, Yu-Ching; Perng, Yeng-Horng; Castro-Lacouture, Daniel","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b15c62ee761d6eefeb7d2ef023f804bfdc41edc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4962171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347986/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph13070630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["system","traditional hospital","energy consumption","hospital managers","building construction","building sector","community public hospital renovation project","simulated vacant school building","existing hospital environmental conditions","sustainable environment","sustainable trend","decision model","solutions","optimal scheme of sustainable renovation strategies","minimal renovation cost","genetic algorithms","medical care","largest world energy consumer","school space","vacant buildings","global organizations","hospitals environments","decision-makers","local community elder-care efforts","graph search algorithms","low environmental impact","maximum quality improvement","trade-offs","order","condition assessment","actions","major task","high standards of hygiene","aging population","example","modern pandemics","declining birth rate","attention","result reveals","study","Taiwan","research"],"language":"en"},

We examined the stabilization activity of 5,924 RNA fragments derived from 26 different viruses (16 RNA viruses and 10 DNA viruses) using next-generation sequencing of these RNAs fused 3\u2032 downstream of GFP reporter RNA. With the Fate-seq approach, we detected multiple virus-derived RNA sequences that stabilized GFP reporter RNA, including sequences derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Comparative genomic analysis revealed that these RNA sequences and their predicted secondary structures are highly conserved between SARS-CoV and the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the global outbreak of the coronavirus-associated disease that emerged in December 2019 (COVID-19).

One-binding-site model and two-binding-site model were used for the analysis of the electrical signals, revealing the number of binding sites on an antibody and the dissociation constants between the antibody and the short peptide. In the binding-site models, the surface coverage ratio of the short peptide on the sensor surface is relevant to the electrical signals resulted from the peptide\u2013antibody binding on the HEMTs. Two binding sites on an antibody were observed and two dissociation constants, 4.404\u00D710(\u221211) M and 1.596\u00D710(\u22129) M, were extracted from the binding-site model through the analysis of the surface coverage ratio of the short peptide on the sensor surface. We have also shown that the conventional method to extract the dissociation constant from the linear regression of curve-fitting with Langmuir isotherm equation may lead to an incorrect information if the receptor has more than one binding site for the ligand. The limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor observed in the experimental result (\u223C10 pM of the short peptide) is very close to the LOD (around 2.7\u20133.4 pM) predicted from the value of the smallest dissociation constants.

Using intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation with mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we have shown that CD8 T cells establish a PD-1(hi), tissue-resident memory population in the brains (bT(RM)) of mice with a low-level persistent infection. In MuPyV encephalitis, PD-L1 was expressed on infiltrating myeloid cells, microglia and astrocytes, but not on oligodendrocytes. Engagement of PD-1 on anti-MuPyV CD8 T cells limited their effector activity. NanoString gene expression analysis showed that neuroinflammation was higher in PD-L1(\u2212/\u2212) than wild type mice at day 8 post-infection, the peak of the MuPyV-specific CD8 response. During the persistent phase of infection, however, the absence of PD-1 signaling was found to be associated with a lower inflammatory response than in wild type mice. Genetic disruption and intracerebroventricular blockade of PD-1 signaling resulted in an increase in number of MuPyV-specific CD8 bT(RM) and the fraction of these cells expressing CD103, the \u03B1E integrin commonly used to define tissue-resident T cells. However, PD-L1(\u2212/\u2212) mice persistently infected with MuPyV showed impaired virus control upon i.c. re-infection with MuPyV. Collectively, these data reveal a temporal duality in PD-1-mediated regulation of MuPyV-associated neuroinflammation. PD-1 signaling limited the severity of neuroinflammation during acute infection but sustained a level of inflammation during persistent infection for maintaining control of virus re-infection.","publish_time":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shwetank,; Frost, Elizabeth L.; Mockus, Taryn E.; Ren, Heather M.; Toprak, Mesut; Lauver, Matthew D.; Netherby-Winslow, Colleen S.; Jin, Ge; Cosby, Jennifer M.; Evavold, Brian D.; Lukacher, Aron E.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20ae5549ea5761744ffac3015a31a03816699a49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6499176.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105690/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00783","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PD-L1","Engagement of PD","absence of PD","anti-MuPyV CD8 T cells","number of MuPyV","MuPyV encephalitis","post-infection","acute infection","MuPyV-specific CD8 response","intracerebroventricular blockade of PD","functionality of T cells","low-level persistent infection","persistent phase of infection","tissue-resident T cells","mediated regulation of MuPyV","control of virus re-infection","specific CD8 bT","infiltrating myeloid cells","wild type mice","associated neuroinflammation","severity of neuroinflammation","RM","impaired virus control","tissue-resident memory population","lower inflammatory response","repetitive antigenic stimulation","day","peak","chronic infections","astrocytes","brains","level of inflammation","NanoString gene expression analysis","effector activity","tumors","CD103","microglia","inoculation","Genetic disruption","\u03B1E integrin","fraction","mouse polyomavirus","temporal duality","Programmed cell death","data","increase","receptor","oligodendrocytes"],"language":"en"},

It also shapes the adaptive immune response generated by both T and B cells. Production of type I IFN occurs both in vivo and in vitro in response to Bluetongue virus (BTV), an arthropod-borne virus. However, the mechanisms responsible for the production of IFN-\u03B2 in response to BTV remained unknown until recently and are still not completely understood. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the identification of cellular sensors and signalling pathways involved in this process. The RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) were shown to be involved in the expression of IFN-\u03B2 as well as in the control of BTV infection in non-haematopoietic cells. In contrast, induction of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 synthesis in sheep primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) required the MyD88 adaptor independently of the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), as well as the kinases dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). As type I IFN is essential for the establishment of an antiviral cellular response, most of viruses have elaborated counteracting mechanisms to hinder its action. This review also addresses the ability of BTV to interfere with IFN-\u03B2 synthesis and the recent findings describing the non-structural viral protein NS3 as a powerful antagonist of the host cellular response.","publish_time":"2014-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vitour, Damien; Doceul, Virginie; Ruscanu, Suzana; Chauveau, Emilie; Schwartz-Cornil, Isabelle; Zientara, St\u00E9phan","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2a30405f00f56c94c687feab84b2dc1d2ed67da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114367.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211608/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213003742; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213003742; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.10.027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BTV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of IFN","IFN-\u03B2 synthesis","IFN-\u03B1","induction of IFN","expression of IFN","antiviral cellular response","host cellular response","innate immune response","adaptive immune response","production of type","control of BTV infection","stress-activated protein kinase","ability of BTV","N-terminal protein kinase","kinases dsRNA-activated protein kinase","viruses","B cells","review","non-structural viral protein NS3","identification of cellular sensors","non-haematopoietic cells","recent findings","recent advances","counteracting mechanisms","mechanisms responsible","Bluetongue virus","sheep primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells","melanoma differentiation-associated gene","RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene","powerful antagonist","pDCs","PKR","SAPK","signalling pathways","establishment","line of defence","pro-inflammatory cytokines","Toll","RIG","JNK","MyD88 adaptor","MDA5","contrast","arthropod","receptor","TLR7","process","action"],"language":"en"},

In addition, the relationship between the clinical characteristics of patients and significant intervention scores was analyzed. We enrolled patients younger than 12 months who were diagnosed with ALTE from January 2005 to December 2012. There were 29 ALTE infants with a peak incidence of age younger than 1 month (48.3%). The most common symptoms for ALTE diagnosis were apnea (69.0%) and color change (58.6%). Eleven patients appeared normal upon arrival at hospital but 2 patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the initial ALTE. The most common ALTE cause was respiratory disease, including respiratory infection and upper airway anomalies (44.8%). There were 20 cases of repeat ALTE and 2 cases of death during hospitalization. Four patients (15.4%) experienced recurrence of ALTE after discharge and 4 patients (15.4%) showed developmental abnormalities during the follow-up period. The patients with ALTE during sleep had lower significant intervention scores (P=0.015) compared to patients with ALTE during wakefulness and patients with previous respiratory symptoms had higher significant intervention scores (P=0.013) than those without previous respiratory symptoms. Although not statistically significant, there was a weak positive correlation between the patient\u0027s total ALTE criteria and total significant intervention score (Fig. 2, r=0.330, P=0.080).

METHODS: Since the ICU renovation, all patients colonized or infected with MRSA were nursed in single rooms with contact precautions. The incidence of MRSA infection in the ICU was monitored during 3 different phases: the baseline period (phase 1); after ICU renovation (phase 2) and after implementation of a hand hygiene campaign with alcohol-based hand rub (phase 3). Patients infected with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were chosen as controls because they were managed in open cubicles with standard precautions. RESULTS: Without a major change in bed occupancy rate, nursing workforce, or the protocol of environmental cleansing throughout the study period, a stepwise reduction in ICU onset nonbacteraemic MRSA infection was observed: from 3.54 (phase 1) to 2.26 (phase 2, p = 0.042) and 1.02 (phase 3, p = 0.006) per 1000-patient-days. ICU onset bacteraemic MRSA infection was significantly reduced from 1.94 (phase 1) to 0.9 (phase 2, p = 0.005) and 0.28 (phase 3, p = 0.021) per 1000-patient-days. Infection due to ESBL-producing organisms did not show a corresponding reduction. The usage density of broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluoroquinolones increased from phase 1 to 3. However a significant trend improvement of ICU onset MRSA infection by segmented regression analysis can only be demonstrated when comparison was made before and after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. This suggests that the deaths of fellow healthcare workers from an occupational acquired infection had an overwhelming effect on their compliance with infection control measures. CONCLUSION: Provision of single room isolation facilities and promotion of hand hygiene practice are important. However compliance with infection control measures relies largely on a personal commitment, which may increase when personal safety is threatened.","publish_time":"2010-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Vincent CC; Tai, Josepha WM; Chan, WM; Lau, Eric HY; Chan, Jasper FW; To, Kelvin KW; Li, Iris WS; Ho, PL; Yuen, KY","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac14252dbac614e01fef29b981cd841aa223f28e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2944349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20822509/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-263","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","MRSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of MRSA infection","ICU onset nonbacteraemic MRSA infection","ICU onset bacteraemic MRSA infection","ICU renovation","infection control measures","significant trend improvement of ICU onset MRSA infection","enhanced infection control program","occupational acquired infection","single rooms","hand hygiene campaign","ESBL","compliance","patients","patient-days","promotion of hand hygiene practice","alcohol-based hand rub","stepwise reduction","study period","baseline period","corresponding reduction","standard precautions","contact precautions","personal commitment","personal safety","Provision of single room isolation facilities","overwhelming effect","nursing workforce","bed occupancy rate","segmented regression analysis","adult intensive care unit","major change","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","SARS","spread of methicillin","deaths of fellow healthcare workers","extended spectrum beta-lactamase","fluoroquinolones","installation","severe acute respiratory syndrome","protocol of environmental cleansing","Escherichia coli","usage density of broad-spectrum antibiotics","different phases","Klebsiella species","epidemic","CONCLUSION","organisms","implementation","open cubicles","controls","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","hospital","METHODS","comparison"],"language":"en"},

PBs and SGs are able to release mRNAs thus allowing their translation. PBs are constitutive, but respond to stimuli that affect mRNA translation and decay, whereas SGs are specifically induced upon cellular stress, which triggers a global translational silencing by several pathways, including phosphorylation of the key translation initiation factor elF2alpha, and tRNA cleavage among others. PBs and SGs with different composition may coexist in a single cell. These macromolecular aggregates are highly conserved through evolution, from unicellular organisms to vertebrate neurons. Their dynamics is regulated by several signaling pathways, and depends on microfilaments and microtubules, and the cognate molecular motors myosin, dynein, and kinesin. SGs share features with aggresomes and related aggregates of unfolded proteins frequently present in neurodegenerative diseases, and may play a role in the pathology. Virus infections may induce or impair SG formation. Besides being important for mRNA regulation upon stress, SGs modulate the signaling balancing apoptosis and cell survival.

As in much of the industrialised world, dairy farming in Japan is rapidly changing. Many farmers are forced by neo-liberal agricultural policies to shift from small family operated farms to high-tech, high-speed, and high overhead industrial operations. This paper focuses on the history of dairy farming in the Tokachi region; more specifically one farm and the shift over a generation to a rotary parlour milking system. It addresses the linkages this mode of production has cultivated amongst humans, dairy cows and industrialized space. The parlour system at Great Hopes Farm allows five workers (aided by three more stall staff) to milk over 1000 cows, fifty at a time, three times a day. The impetus behind moving to parlour technology is that it increases productivity through mechanically enhanced observation and control. However this recent mechanical separation of human and cow during the milking process has led to affectively shared interspecies and inter-human alienation. The technology of the parlour system sets daily rhythms for bovine and human alike, and separates both from a process formerly dependent upon, specialized knowledge, affective empathy, and embodied knowledge. Human and bovine experience the systemic violence of the machine and what remains is a complex bio-politics of interspecies affect and the separation of \u201Cbare\u201D and \u201Cpolitical\u201D life.","publish_time":"2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hansen, Paul","journal":"J Rural Stud","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/922de5c64c00597e24853303aec4f46516315113.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127193.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0743016713000107; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2013.02.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288170/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016713000107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Great Hopes Farm"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["parlour system","industrial dairy farm","dairy cows","parlour technology","rotary parlour milking system","history of dairy farming","inter-human alienation","recent mechanical separation of human","milking process","shift","Great Hopes Farm","interspecies affect","bovine experience","specialized knowledge","embodied knowledge","high overhead industrial operations","small family operated farms","humans","Hokkaido","generation","affective empathy","neo-liberal agricultural policies","daily rhythms","productivity","systemic violence","Japan\u0027s northernmost Island","complex bio-politics","Tokachi region","machine","workers","industrialised world","industrialized space","separates","mode of production","enhanced observation","control","farmers","stall staff","doctoral degree","months","fieldwork","times","day","life","linkages","paper","impetus","year"],"language":"en"},

To drive fusion, these proteins undergo large conformational changes that must occur at the right place and at the right time. Understanding the elements which control the stability of the prefusion state and the initiation of conformational changes is key to understanding the function of these important proteins. The construction of mutations in the fusion protein transmembrane domains (TMDs) or the replacement of these domains with lipid anchors has implicated the TMD in the fusion process. However, the structural and molecular details of the role of the TMD in these fusion events remain unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that isolated paramyxovirus fusion protein TMDs associate in a monomer-trimer equilibrium, using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Using a similar approach, the work presented here indicates that trimeric interactions also occur between the fusion protein TMDs of Ebola virus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), and rabies virus. Our results suggest that TM-TM interactions are important in the fusion protein function of diverse viral families. IMPORTANCE Many important human pathogens are enveloped viruses that utilize membrane-bound glycoproteins to mediate viral entry. Factors that contribute to the stability of these glycoproteins have been identified in the ectodomain of several viral fusion proteins, including residues within the soluble ectodomain. Although it is often thought to simply act as an anchor, the transmembrane domain of viral fusion proteins has been implicated in protein stability and function as well. Here, using a biophysical approach, we demonstrated that the fusion protein transmembrane domains of several deadly pathogens\u2014Ebola virus, influenza virus, SARS CoV, and rabies virus\u2014self-associate. This observation across various viral families suggests that transmembrane domain interactions may be broadly relevant and serve as a new target for therapeutic development.","publish_time":"2018-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webb, Stacy R.; Smith, Stacy E.; Fried, Michael G.; Dutch, Rebecca Ellis","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cff09cd72961bfaa2c50919e65b093c20937b137.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5907656.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00047-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29669880/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion events","fusion process","fusion protein transmembrane domains","transmembrane domain of viral fusion proteins","fusion protein TMDs of Ebola virus","fusion protein function of diverse viral families","protein stability","isolated paramyxovirus fusion protein TMDs associate","influenza virus","rabies virus","viral envelope","viral entry","important proteins","various viral families","transmembrane domain interactions","TM-TM interactions","SARS CoV","Enveloped viruses","important human pathogens","trimeric interactions","initiation of conformational changes","membrane-bound glycoproteins","target cell membrane","large conformational changes","deadly pathogens","self-associate","new target","right place","right time","soluble ectodomain","similar approach","biophysical approach","monomer-trimer equilibrium","sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","role","replacement","residues","prefusion state","work","lipid anchors","IMPORTANCE","construction of mutations","molecular details","therapeutic development","results","observation","Factors","elements"],"language":"en"},

This is especially a problem for emerging pathogens that are newly introduced into the human population and carry the inherent risk of pandemic spread in a na\u00EFve population. For such situations, a considerable number of different platform technologies are under development. These are also under development for pathogens, where directly derived vaccines are regarded as too complicated or even dangerous due to the induction of inefficient or unwanted immune responses causing considerable side-effects as for dengue virus. Among platform technologies are plasmid-based DNA vaccines, RNA replicons, single-round infectious vector particles, or replicating vaccine-based vectors encoding (a) critical antigen(s) of the target pathogens. Among the latter, recombinant measles viruses derived from vaccine strains have been tested. Measles vaccines are among the most effective and safest life-attenuated vaccines known. Therefore, the development of Schwarz-, Moraten-, or AIK-C-strain derived recombinant vaccines against a wide range of mostly viral, but also bacterial pathogens was quite straightforward. These vaccines generally induce powerful humoral and cellular immune responses in appropriate animal models, i.e., transgenic mice or non-human primates. Also in the recent first clinical phase I trial, the results have been quite encouraging. The trial indicated the expected safety and efficacy also in human patients, interestingly independent from the level of prevalent anti-measles immunity before the trial. Thereby, recombinant measles vaccines expressing additional antigens are a promising platform for future vaccines.","publish_time":"2017-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FChlebach, Michael D.","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9417715e7bba6686a48259826d7167995a669ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089060.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-017-1486-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710608/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Schwarz"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant vaccines","recombinant measles vaccines","future vaccines","classic development of vaccines","plasmid-based DNA vaccines","safest life-attenuated vaccines","trial","recombinant measles viruses","human population","bacterial pathogens","target pathogens","development of Schwarz","emerging pathogens","promising platform","human patients","considerable number of different platform technologies","cellular immune responses","unwanted immune responses","vaccine-based vectors","non-human primates","level of prevalent anti-measles immunity","considerable side-effects","vaccine strains","na\u00EFve population","appropriate animal models","RNA replicons","transgenic mice","additional antigens","induction of inefficient","infectious vector particles","inherent risk of pandemic spread","efficacy","AIK-C","expected safety","wide range","critical antigen","results","clinical phase","Moraten","dengue virus","situations","problem","case of HIV"],"language":"en"},

To fabricate the nanolayer on the PET substrate, Au is sputter coated on the flexible PET substrate and MoS(2) NPs are spin coated on Au, which is sputter coated once again with Au. The gp120 antibody is then immobilized on this flexible electrode through cysteamine (Cys) modified on the surface of the Au/MoS(2)/Au nanolayer. Fabrication of the biosensor is verified by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. A flexibility test is done using a micro-fatigue tester. Detection of the gp120 is measured by square wave voltammetry. The results indicate that the prepared biosensor detects 0.1 pg/mL of gp120, which is comparable with previously reported gp120 biosensors prepared even without flexibility.

These results support the notion of using well-characterized recombinant vaccine as an adjunct to improve the current chemotherapy of CanL.","publish_time":"2008-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miret, Jorge; Nascimento, Evaldo; Sampaio, Weverton; Fran\u00E7a, Jo\u00E3o Carlos; Fujiwara, Ricardo Toshio; Vale, Andr\u00E9; Dias, Edelberto Santos; Vieira, Edv\u00E1; Costa, Roberto Teodoro da; Mayrink, Wilson; Neto, Antonio Campos; Reed, Steven","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/176a9159206a6bde18152a197a946ee73d33f07f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127155.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08000340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18328956/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.01.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08000340","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leishmania"],"organizations":["MPL-SE\u00AE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adjuvant MPL-SE","Glucantime","immunochemotherapy protocol","immunochemotherapy cohorts","symptomatic dogs","parasitological test","generation recombinant vaccine Leish","control groups","infected mongrel dogs","current chemotherapy of CanL","Additional groups","placebo","parasitological cure","clinical parameters","well-characterized recombinant vaccine","standard treatment","clinical trial","Evaluation of haematological","specific cellular reactivity","cellular immune response","higher survival probability","leishmanial antigens","number of deaths","hepatic function","plasmatic proteins","comparison","adjunct","combination of N","methyl meglumine antimoniate","notion","improvement","purpose","efficacy","Leishmania chagasi","Animals","canine leishmaniasis","immunotherapy","results","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in affected countries. These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly. Even though the current crisis can bring with it opportunities for personal growth and family cohesion, disadvantages may outweigh these benefits. Anxiety, lack of peer contact and reduced opportunities for stress regulation are main concerns. Another main threat is an increased risk for parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment. Especially for children and adolescents with special needs or disadvantages, such as disabilities, trauma experiences, already existing mental health problems, migrant background and low socioeconomic status, this may be a particularly challenging time. To maintain regular and emergency child and adolescent psychiatric treatment during the pandemic is a major challenge but is necessary for limiting long-term consequences for the mental health of children and adolescents. Urgent research questions comprise understanding the mental health effects of social distancing and economic pressure, identifying risk and resilience factors, and preventing long-term consequences, including\u2014but not restricted to\u2014child maltreatment. The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry. CONCLUSION: There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized. Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fegert, J\u00F6rg M.; Vitiello, Benedetto; Plener, Paul L.; Clemens, Vera","journal":"Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db51562632edfb8154e5281475cb8fa8b5ca2423.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7216870.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-020-00329-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mental health of children","mental health risks","adolescents","existing mental health problems","numerous mental health threats","mental health effects of social distancing","child maltreatment","parental mental illness","emergency child","current pandemic","increased risk","disadvantages","adolescent psychiatrists","adolescent psychiatry","long-term consequences","COVID","adolescent psychiatric treatment","reduced opportunities","economic pressure","migrant background","economic shutdown","main concerns","main threat","efficacy of telehealth","efficacy of telepsychiatry","subsequent restrictions","current crisis","lack of peer contact","benefit ratio of measures","Urgent research questions","stress regulation","domestic violence","complete change","applications","trauma experiences","family cohesion","resilience factors","psychosocial environment","disabilities","low socioeconomic status","personal growth","continuity of care","home schooling","special needs","major challenge","affected countries","relevant issue","order","Anxiety","phases","coronavirus disease","Isolation","CONCLUSION","potential","benefits","implications of policies","future developments","life","globe","challenging time"],"language":"en"},

However, for duck enteritis virus (DEV), which is an unassigned member of the family Herpesviridae, little information is available about the function of the two proteins. In this study, the C-terminus of DEV UL26 protein (designated UL26c), which contains the whole of UL26.5, was expressed, and the recombinant UL26c protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The mAb 1C8 was generated against DEV UL26 and UL26.5 proteins and used subsequently to map the epitope in this region. Both the mAb and its defined epitope will provide potential tools for further study of DEV. RESULTS: A mAb (designated 1C8) was generated against the DEV UL26c protein, and a series of 17 partially overlapping fragments that spanned the DEV UL26c were expressed with GST tags. These peptides were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis using mAb 1C8 to identify the epitope. A linear motif, (520)IYYPGE(525), which was located at the C-terminus of the DEV UL26 and UL26.5 proteins, was identified by mAb 1C8. The result of the ELISA showed that this epitope could be recognized by DEV-positive serum from mice. The (520)IYYPGE(525 )motif was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by analysis of the reactivity of 1C8 with several truncated peptides derived from the motif. Alignment and comparison of the 1C8-defined epitope sequence with those of other alphaherpesviruses indicated that the motif (521)YYPGE(525 )in the epitope sequence was conserved among the alphaherpesviruses. CONCLUSION: A mAb, 1C8, was generated against DEV UL26c and the epitope-defined minimal sequence obtained using mAb 1C8 was (520)IYYPGE(525). The mAb and the identified epitope may be useful for further study of the design of diagnostic reagents for DEV.","publish_time":"2010-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xiaoli; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Yu, Dan; Li, Huixin; Wang, Yu; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c35ad1f1cce2ad652da7d78b1c8f6849ebf73acf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2949831.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20836860/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DEV","GST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mAb 1C8","DEV UL26 protein","1C8-defined epitope sequence","DEV UL26c protein","reactivity of 1C8","designated 1C8","identified epitope","designated UL26c","DEV-positive serum","study of","recombinant UL26c protein","IYYPGE","C-terminus","c mice","minimal sequence","linear motif","ELISA","proteins of herpes simplex virus","alphaherpesviruses","function","minimal requirement","truncated peptides","western blotting analysis","duck enteritis virus","family Herpesviridae","little information","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","BALB","series","RESULTS","monoclonal antibodies","potential tools","unassigned member","overlapping fragments","comparison","design of diagnostic reagents","GST tags","BACKGROUND","Alignment","CONCLUSION","assembly","region"],"language":"en"},

Two Cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) isolates, M1 and M2, were studied. Both can infect Phalaenopsis orchids, but only M1 can systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Protoplast inoculation and whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that both isolates can replicate in N. benthamiana; however, M2 was restricted to the initially infected cells. Genome shuffling between M1 and M2 revealed that two control modes are involved in CymMV host dependent movement. The M1 coat protein (CP) plays a dominant role in controlling CymMV movement between cells, because all chimeric CymMV viruses containing the M1 CP systemically infected N. benthamiana plants. Without the M1 CP, one chimeric virus containing the combination of the M1 triple gene block proteins (TGBps), the M2 5\u2032 RNA (1\u20134333), and the M2 CP effectively moved in N. benthamiana plants. Further complementation analysis revealed that M1 TGBp1 and TGBp3 are co-required to complement the movement of the chimeric viruses in N. benthamiana. The amino acids within the CP, TGBp1 and TGBp3 which are required or important for CymMV M2 movement in N. benthamiana plants were mapped. The required amino acids within the CP map to the predicted RNA binding domain. RNA\u2013protein binding assays revealed that M1 CP has higher RNA binding affinity than does M2 CP.

Factors underlying asthma exacerbations include allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, viral infections, exercise, irritants, and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents among others. Exacerbating factors might include one or all of these exposures and vary both among and within patients.

By using real-time PCR, vaccine-induced viremia and shedding were found to be long lasting for both vaccinal strains. Vaccinal CPV-2b shedding was detected for a shorter period than CPV-2 (12 against 19 mean days) but with greater viral loads, whereas viremia occurred for a longer period (22 against 19 mean days) and with higher titers for CPV-2b.

The present study adds new insights into the CPV vaccine persistence in the organism and possible interference with diagnostic tests.","publish_time":"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Decaro, Nicola; Crescenzo, Giuseppe; Desario, Costantina; Cavalli, Alessandra; Losurdo, Michele; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Ventrella, Gianpiero; Rizzi, Stefania; Aulicino, Stefano; Lucente, Maria Stella; Buonavoglia, Canio","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bd909db67202372c9d945f9678b91aedd952ca1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115601.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1400588X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1400588X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793948/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.04.050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Vaccinal CPV","CPV vaccine persistence","extent of CPV vaccine-induced viremia","b shedding","mean days","fecal shedding","days post-vaccination","diagnostic interference","b strain","commercial vaccines","fecal real-time PCR testing","live virus vaccines","possible interference","vaccinated dogs","diagnostic tests","shorter period","longer period","vaccinal strains","organism","new insights","positive results","clinic","hemagglutination test","greater viral loads","bloodstream","long lasting","Abstract Canine parvovirus","exact duration","higher titers","present study","enteric mucosa","gap","aim","Seroconversion"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Serum PCT levels were examined in febrile pediatric patients admitted between August 2013 and August 2014. The patients were divided into 3 groups as follows: 49 with KD, 111 with viral infections, and 24 with bacterial infections. RESULTS: The mean PCT level in the KD group was significantly lower than that in the bacterial infection group (0.82\u00B11.73 ng/mL vs. 3.11\u00B16.10 ng/mL, P=0.002) and insignificantly different from that in the viral infection group (0.23\u00B10.34 ng/mL,P=0.457). The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the KD group were significantly higher than those in the viral and bacterial infection groups (P\u003C0.001 and P\u003C0.001 for ESR, P\u003C0.001 and P=0.005 for CRP, respectively). The proportion of patients in the KD group with PCT levels of \u003E1.0 ng/mL was significantly higher in the nonresponders to the initial intravenous immunoglobulin treatment than in the responders (36% vs. 8%, P=0.01). CONCLUSION: PCT levels may help to differentiate KD from bacterial infections. A combination of disease markers, including ESR, CRP, and PCT, may be useful for differentiating between KD and viral/bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2017-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Na Hyun; Choi, Hee Joung; Kim, Yeo Hyang","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d443900c4eef6494eeaf138236a955c0a040f3bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5410617.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2017.60.4.112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD","ESR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KD group","bacterial infections","viral infections","predicting KD","Serum PCT levels","viral infection group","mean PCT level","bacterial infection groups","ESR","clinical usefulness of PCT level","CRP","febrile pediatric patients","proportion of patients","febrile children","Kawasaki disease","serum procalcitonin","combination of disease markers","mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate","C-reactive protein","initial intravenous immunoglobulin treatment","nonresponders","study","RESULTS","METHODS","PURPOSE","aims","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) implicated in causing multiple ocular abnormalities, such as conjunctivitis, retinal hemorrhages, chorioretinal atrophy, posterior uveitis, optic neuritis, and maculopathies, has rejuvenated a significant interest in understanding the pathogenesis of flaviviruses, including ZIKV, in the eye. In this review, first, we summarize the current knowledge of the major flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever, and Japanese Encephalitis) reported to cause ocular manifestations in humans with emphasis on recent ZIKV outbreaks. Second, being an immune privilege organ, the eye is protected from systemic infections by the presence of blood-retinal barriers (BRB). Hence, we discuss how flaviviruses modulate retinal innate response and breach the protective BRB to cause ocular or retinal pathology. Finally, we describe recently identified infection signatures of ZIKV and discuss whether these system biology-predicted genes or signaling pathways (e.g., cellular metabolism) could contribute to the pathogenesis of ocular manifestations and assist in the development of ocular antiviral therapies against ZIKV and other flaviviruses.","publish_time":"2018-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Sneha; Kumar, Ashok","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6844a1c61fe924441532dad545f96e1d6a6d677c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6213219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274199/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10100530","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cause ocular","pathogenesis of ocular manifestations","pathogenesis of flaviviruses","recent ZIKV outbreaks","major flaviviruses","multiple ocular abnormalities","retinal hemorrhages","retinal barriers","retinal pathology","infection signatures of ZIKV","development of ocular antiviral therapies","systemic infections","retinal innate response","eye","leading cause of systemic human infections","recent outbreaks of Zika virus","chorioretinal atrophy","posterior uveitis","Dengue","conjunctivitis","West Nile","Yellow Fever","protective","humans","emphasis","optic neuritis","pathways","Japanese Encephalitis","presence of blood","system biology-predicted genes","mosquito-transmitted viruses","maculopathies","current knowledge","immune privilege organ","cellular metabolism","under-reporting","review"],"language":"en"},

Then amplification products in which a part of the sequence was different in each sample could be obtained. The target sample in which these amplification products were mixed was injected into a cassette that included the DNA chip with immobilized probes. After the cassette was set in the DNA detection system, Genelyzer, the processes of hybridization, washing, and detection were performed by the system automatically. The positive and negative concordance rates of the existing nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and this method were 100% (40/40 samples) and 97.3% (117/120 samples), respectively.

The WHO declared this as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 31th of January 2020, and finally a pandemic on 11th March 2020. As of March 24th, 2020, the virus has caused a casualty of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 cases are serious. Mainly based on Chinese newspapers, social media and other digital platform data, this paper analyzes the timeline of the key actions taken by the government and people over three months in five different phases. It found that although there was an initial delay in responding, a unique combination of strong governance, strict regulation, strong community vigilance and citizen participation, and wise use of big data and digital technologies, were some of the key factors in China\u2019s efforts to combat this virus. Being inviable and non-measurable (unlike radioactive exposure), appropriate and timely information is very important to form the basic foundation of mitigation and curative measures. Infodemic, as it is termed by WHO, is a key word, where different stakeholder\u2019s participation, along with stricter regulation, is required to reduce the impact of fake news in this information age and social media. Although different countries will need different approaches, focusing on its humanitarian nature and addressing infodemic issues are the two critical factors for future global mitigation efforts.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Jinling; Shaw, Rajib","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b2f9aa011ef30917799a9ddcdf3d24f12bf25a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235433/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072309","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["people","key factors","different approaches","different countries","humanitarian emergency","different phases","different stakeholder\u2019s participation","social media","key actions","key word","digital platform data","citizen participation","strict regulation","critical factors","digital technologies","timely information","information age","stricter regulation","future global mitigation efforts","China\u2019s efforts","humanitarian nature","infodemic issues","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","strong community vigilance","basic foundation of mitigation","unique combination of strong governance","wise use of big data","radioactive exposure","curative measures","impact of fake news","PHEIC","timeline","government","months","Wuhan","Chinese newspapers","authorities","initial delay","notice","COVID","casualty","cases","Coronavirus","investigation","week","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

However, procedures applicable to and knowledge acquired from studies related to domestic animal and human health can be on partly extrapolated to wildlife. This article identifies requirements and challenges inherent in wildlife health investigations, reviews important definitions and novel health investigation methods, and proposes tools and strategies for effective wildlife health surveillance programs. Impediments to wildlife health investigations are largely related to zoological, behavioral and ecological characteristics of wildlife populations and to limited access to investigation materials. These concerns should not be viewed as insurmountable but it is imperative that they are considered in study design, data analysis and result interpretation. It is particularly crucial to remember that health surveillance does not begin in the laboratory but in the fields. In this context, participatory approaches and mutual respect are essential. Furthermore, interdisciplinarity and open minds are necessary because a wide range of tools and knowledge from different fields need to be integrated in wildlife health surveillance and research. The identification of factors contributing to disease emergence requires the comparison of health and ecological data over time and among geographical regions. Finally, there is a need for the development and validation of diagnostic tests for wildlife species and for data on free-ranging population densities. Training of health professionals in wildlife diseases should also be improved. Overall, the article particularly emphasizes five needs of wildlife health investigations: communication and collaboration; use of synergies and triangulation approaches; investments for the long term; systematic collection of metadata; and harmonization of definitions and methods.","publish_time":"2013-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ryser-Degiorgis, Marie-Pierre","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/884dd07ab59ebdbfc976e42f6e32b3b19be16363.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4228302.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24188616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective wildlife health investigations","needs of wildlife health investigations","wildlife diseases","human health","wildlife species","comparison of health","effective wildlife health surveillance programs","Training of health professionals","novel health investigation methods","ecological characteristics of wildlife populations","ecological data","data analysis","human diseases","knowledge","research","article","harmonization of definitions","participatory approaches","triangulation approaches","domestic animal","growing concerns","investigation materials","different fields","reviews important definitions","wide range of tools","increasing number of animal","biodiversity loss","strategies","long term","challenges inherent","investments","collaboration","communication","systematic collection of metadata","validation of diagnostic tests","mutual respect","fast changing world","synergies","study design","disease emergence","studies","time","requirements","open minds","result interpretation","context","development","access","geographical regions","identification of factors","interdisciplinarity","population densities","Impediments","procedures applicable","laboratory"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: In this work, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has been predicted based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach. The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between January 22, 2020, and April 3, 2020. The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models. RESULTS: The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India. If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further. This presented epidemiological model is an effort to predict the future forecast of COVID-19 spread, based on the present scenario, so that the government can frame policy decisions, and necessary actions can be initiated.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tiwari, Sunita; Kumar, Sushil; Guleria, Kalpna","journal":"Disaster medicine and public health preparedness","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7fef36653e03a71b303540a710b81c4e2cbe9c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211803.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317044/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India","China"],"keyphrases":["Government of India","outbreak","total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID","citizens of India","number of confirmed cases","future forecast of COVID","death cases","number of deaths","METHOD","OBJECTIVE","end","epidemiological model","spread","effort","policy decisions","proactive steps","machine learning approach","impact of coronavirus disease","pattern of China","lockdown","necessary actions","present scenario","data available","effects","paper","pandemic","work","severe shortage of hospitals","time series","prediction models","control measures","peak","weeks","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","country"],"language":"en"},

Many life-threatening diseases, such as AIDS, SARS, hepatitis and some cancers, are caused by viruses. Because viruses have small genome sizes and high mutability, there is currently a lack of and an urgent need for effective treatment for many viral pathogens. One approach that has recently received much attention is aptamer-based therapeutics. Aptamer technology has high target specificity and versatility, i.e., any viral proteins could potentially be targeted. Consequently, new aptamer-based therapeutics have the potential to lead a revolution in the development of anti-infective drugs. Additionally, aptamers can potentially bind any targets and any pathogen that is theoretically amenable to rapid targeting, making aptamers invaluable tools for treating a wide range of diseases. This review will provide a broad, comprehensive overview of viral therapies that use aptamers. The aptamer selection process will be described, followed by an explanation of the potential for treating virus infection by aptamers. Recent progress and prospective use of aptamers against a large variety of human viruses, such as HIV-1, HCV, HBV, SCoV, Rabies virus, HPV, HSV and influenza virus, with particular focus on clinical development of aptamers will also be described. Finally, we will discuss the challenges of advancing antiviral aptamer therapeutics and prospects for future success.","publish_time":"2013-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shum, Ka-To; Zhou, Jiehua; Rossi, John J.","journal":"Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7740a58d95fb643e40af517b3da5a3d925edb50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3873675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24287493/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph6121507","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral aptamer therapeutics","clinical development of aptamers","Aptamer technology","prospective use of aptamers","new aptamer-based therapeutics","aptamers invaluable tools","aptamer selection process","Rabies virus","influenza virus","virus infection","potential","viral pathogens","viral proteins","large variety of human viruses","high mutability","comprehensive overview of viral therapies","life-threatening diseases","high target specificity","wide range of diseases","development of anti-infective drugs","particular focus","versatility","HPV","HSV","rapid targeting","effective treatment","HBV","SCoV","small genome sizes","prospects","urgent need","future success","HCV","AIDS","SARS","HIV","revolution","Recent progress","attention","hepatitis","lack","cancers","challenges","review","cells","targets","explanation","ever-changing environment","organism","approach"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, individual sow productivity of Berkshire sows exposed to PED virus at different stages of production was compared. On a commercial farrow-to-finish farm in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, the clinical presence of PED was observed in the farrowing barn on January 6, 2014, and all gilts and sows were immunized on January 9, except those in the farrowing barn. The sows were categorized into six groups based on the period in which they were exposed to PED virus: between days 0\u201330 (G1), 31\u201360 (G2), 61\u201390 (G3), or after 91 days of pregnancy (G4), during lactation (L), and after weaning (W). The control group was not exposed to PED during the period of PED outbreak. The study was based on 574 production records. The sows of the G4 and L groups had the fewest piglets weaned (4.8\u00B10.4, and 4.0\u00B10.3 pigs, respectively; P\u003C0.05) and the greatest pre-weaning mortality (33.1\u00B14.8%, and 39.7\u00B14.1%, respectively; P\u003C0.05). The number of piglets weaned and pre-weaning mortality, however, did not differ among the G1, G2, G3, and uninfected groups. The G4 and W groups had slightly lesser farrowing rates than the uninfected group (P\u003C0.05), however, similar subsequent piglet litter performance as the uninfected group. In conclusion, the effect of PED on individual sow productivity differed with the production stage in which sows were exposed to PED virus.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furutani, Aina; Kawabata, Tadahiro; Sueyoshi, Masuo; Sasaki, Yosuke","journal":"Animal Reproduction Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd5907332194353d7ec2be2d74f3262ff00b7076.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126730.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432017300295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28683954/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378432017300295; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.06.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PED virus","effect of PED","period of PED outbreak","uninfected groups","clinical presence of PED","W groups","G4","farrowing barn","individual sow productivity of Berkshire sows","production stage","production records","control group","greatest pre-weaning mortality","G3","G2","G1","lesser farrowing rates","different stages of production","present study","number of piglets","fewest piglets","days of pregnancy","emerging disease of pigs","Japan","finish farm","Kagoshima Prefecture","similar subsequent piglet litter performance","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea","commercial farrow","countries","lactation","conclusion","gilts"],"language":"en"},

For highly diverged sequences, such phylogenetic techniques sometimes estimate surprisingly recent divergence times. In the case of viruses, independent evidence indicates that the estimates of deep divergence times from molecular phylogenetics are sometimes too recent. This discrepancy is caused in part by inadequate models of purifying selection leading to branch-length underestimation. Here we examine the effect on branch-length estimation of using models that incorporate experimental measurements of purifying selection. We find that models informed by experimentally measured site-specific amino-acid preferences estimate longer deep branches on phylogenies of influenza virus hemagglutinin. This lengthening of branches is due to more realistic stationary states of the models, and is mostly independent of the branch-length extension from modeling site-to-site variation in amino-acid substitution rate. The branch-length extension from experimentally informed site-specific models is similar to that achieved by other approaches that allow the stationary state to vary across sites. However, the improvements from all of these site-specific but time homogeneous and site independent models are limited by the fact that a protein\u2019s amino-acid preferences gradually shift as it evolves. Overall, our work underscores the importance of modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences when estimating deep divergence times\u2014but also shows the inherent limitations of approaches that fail to account for how these preferences shift over time.","publish_time":"2018-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilton, Sarah K; Bloom, Jesse D","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9622ec04bc88f584cd280c9dccd177066960cf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6220371.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vey033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425841/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["site independent models","informed site-specific models","branch-length extension","protein\u2019s amino-acid preferences","importance of modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences","branch-length estimation","branch-length underestimation","recent divergence times","estimates of deep divergence times","inadequate models of purifying selection","deep branches","amino-acid substitution rate","site variation","independent evidence","divergence of modern gene sequences","time homogeneous","Molecular phylogenetics","experimental measurements of purifying selection","lengthening of branches","diverged sequences","realistic stationary states","inherent limitations of approaches","phylogenetic techniques","phylogenies of influenza virus hemagglutinin","fact","case of viruses","work","effect","sites","discrepancy","improvements"],"language":"en"},

The primary function of the HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is to recognize viral genomic RNA, which leads to ribonucleocapsid formation. Here, we characterized the stability and identified the functional regions of the recombinant HCoV-OC43 N protein. Circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements revealed that the HCoV-OC43 N protein is more highly ordered and stabler than the SARS-CoV N protein previously studied. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments showed that the affinity of HCoV-OC43 N protein for RNA was approximately fivefold higher than that of N protein for DNA. Moreover, we found that the HCoV-OC43 N protein contains three RNA-binding regions in its N-terminal region (residues 1\u2013173) and central-linker region (residues 174\u2013232 and 233\u2013300).

Serologically, a distinction has been made between type I and II FCoVs, the latter of which more closely resemble canine coronavirus (CCV). To gain more insight into the genetic relationships between different FCoV biotypes, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the ORF7a/7b transcription unit of nine strains. The following observations were made: (i) The sequences are 87-100% identical. In this part of the genome, type I and II FCoVs are more closely related to each other than to CCV. To explain the genetic and antigenic differences between the spike genes of type I and II FCoVs, we postulate that type II FCoVs have arisen by an RNA recombination event between a type I FCoV and CCV. (ii) The avirulent \u0022FECV\u0022 strains UCD and 79-1683 are more similar to virulent \u0022FIPV\u0022 strains than to each other. Our findings thus support the notion that FECV and FIPV are not different species but merely virulence variants. (iii) In contrast to FECV 79-1683, FECV UCD contains an intact ORF7b, indicating that ORF7b deletions are not a universal distinguishing property of FECVs. (iv) ORF7b deletions readily occur in vitro, correlating with loss of virulence. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, we show that in naturally occurring FCoVs ORF7b is maintained Thus, ORF7b seems to provide a distinct selective advantage during natural infection.","publish_time":"1995-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herrewegh, Arnold A.P.M.; Vennema, Harry; Horzinek, Marian C.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; de Groot, Raoul J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285715206; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285715206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCV","FECV","FECV UCD","UCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCoVs ORF7b","ORF7b deletions","FECV UCD","intact ORF7b","CCV","strains UCD","spike genes of type","feline enteric coronaviruses","Abstract Feline coronaviruses","different FCoV biotypes","feline infectious peritonitis viruses","different species","genetic relationships","nucleotide sequences","virulence variants","loss of virulence","b transcription unit","universal distinguishing property of FECVs","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis","FIPVs","ORF7a","distinct selective advantage","antigenic differences","RNA recombination event","natural infection","basis of pathogenic properties","insight","notion","avirulent","canine coronavirus","findings","following observations","contrast","distinction","genome"],"language":"en"},

Western European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are mammalian hibernators, mainly nocturnal and insectivorous, living in natural open and green spaces as well as artificial, rural and urban, areas. They are generalist predators of macro-invertebrates, but they may also eat meat, bird eggs and on occasion pet food. These ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possibility of intra- and interspecies interactions accounting for the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of several potentially emerging pathogens, including coronaviruses. Using PCR-based and virus isolation methods, we found that 58.3% of 24 hedgehogs\u2019 fecal samples were PCR-positive for Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs). We did not observe any clinical disease related to the EriCoV infection in hedgehogs. However, the high mutation rates characterizing members of the Coronaviridae family and their potential successful interspecies host jumps\u2014as that likely occurred in the Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emergence\u2014should be considered in the management of hedgehogs admitted to multi-species wildlife rehabilitation centers, recommending their return back to the original recovery areas. ABSTRACT: The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them, E. amurensis is extant in East Asia\u2019s areas only, whereas E. europaeus, E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe, including Italy. Western European hedgehogs\u2019 ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses, influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus, pestiviruses and Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned pathogens by both PCR-based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found PCR-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delogu, Mauro; Cotti, Claudia; Lelli, Davide; Sozzi, Enrica; Trogu, Tiziana; Lavazza, Antonio; Garuti, Giacomo; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Vaccari, Gabriele; De Marco, Maria Alessandra; Moreno, Ana","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7cf263327a7e6d830c8fa2498c0e1a57ca53758.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7143230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32121543/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10030407","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Erinaceus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["East Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Erinaceus europaeus","europaeus individuals","domestic species","wildlife species","emerging viruses","hedgehog species","known Erinaceus coronaviruses","PCR-positive","virus genome","genus Erinaceus","virus isolation methods","emerging pathogens","Western European hedgehogs\u2019 ecological","Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus","emerging RNA viruses","emerging infections","management of hedgehogs","high population densities","canine distemper virus","rural areas of Northern Italy","notable synanthropic attitudes","frequent contacts","influenza D viruses","humans","multi-species wildlife rehabilitation centers","possible involvement of","habits","East Asia\u2019s areas","ecology","original recovery areas","EriCoVs","hedgehogs\u2019 fecal samples","high mutation rates","natural reservoirs of CoVs","animal reservoirs","clinical disease","southern Europe","above-mentioned pathogens","interspecies interactions accounting","potential successful interspecies host jumps","Coronaviridae family","pestiviruses","return","mammalian hibernators","bird eggs","members","possibility of intra-","green spaces","lineage C","occasion pet food","chronic shedding carriers","amurensis","EriCoV infection","betacoronaviruses","partial sequencing","nCoV","generalist predators of macro-invertebrates","meat","concolor","ABSTRACT","Novel coronavirus","emergence","roumanicus","SIMPLE SUMMARY","findings"],"language":"en"},

Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak. SETTING: A large teaching tertiary healthcare centre in KSA; the outbreak lasted 6 weeks from June 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected via individual and focus group interviews with 28 key informant participants (9 management decision-makers and 19 frontline healthcare workers). DESIGN: We used qualitative methods of process evaluation to examine perceptions of the outbreak and the factors contributing to, or detracting from successful management. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Five themes and 15 subthemes were found. The themes were related to: (1) the high stress of the outbreak, (2) factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, (3) factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, (4) factors inhibiting outbreak control and (5) long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management. CONCLUSION: Management of the MERS-CoV outbreak at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh was widely recognised by staff as a serious outbreak of local and national significance. While the outbreak was controlled successfully in 6 weeks, progress in management was inhibited by a lack of institutional readiness to implement infection control (IC) measures and reduce patient flow, low staff morale and high anxiety. Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and teamwork and harnessing collective leadership. Future major IC crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, better coordination of media management and proactive staff counselling and support.","publish_time":"2019-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al Knawy, Bandar Abdulmohsen; Al-Kadri, Hanan M F; Elbarbary, Mahmoud; Arabi, Yaseen; Balkhy, Hanan H; Clark, Alex","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59c84e06ac8246b44efc595cafef84b946f24219.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4af614b04d5df393575c749cd953aa3855fa8b44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6502063.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061009/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017476","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["outbreak management","outbreak occurrence","MERS-CoV outbreak","success of outbreak control","serious outbreak of local","Effective management","factors","organisational management","successful management","management decision-makers","major outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","proactive staff","clinical staff","better coordination of media management","infection control","rapid control","low staff morale","key decision-makers","measures","KSA","perceptions","Data","weeks","key informant participants","Future major IC crises","high anxiety","high stress","frontline healthcare workers","long-term institutional gains","lack of institutional readiness","qualitative methods of process evaluation","qualitative thematic content analysis","large teaching tertiary healthcare centre","patient flow","King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh","sharing learning","greater involvement","group interviews","trust","areas","knowledge","response","SETTING","individual","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","teamwork","national significance","novel coronavirus","collective leadership","study","support","RESULTS","subthemes","OBJECTIVES","DESIGN","Perspectives","progress","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Among 3545 terms or near term healthy babies who underwent cranial ultrasound examination in our hospital over a 2-year 5-month period, 18 were found to have FHCs (17 typical and one atypical; seven bilateral and 11 unilateral, of which seven were on the left and four on the right). The female to male ratio was 2:1. The incidence of FHCs in normal term babies was thus 0.5%. Six children had resolution of the cyst within 1 month, and 6 more had resolution on repeat scan from 2 to 11 months of age. Four children did not have subsequent ultrasonography to document resolution, but they had normal growth and development. Two were lost to follow up. The infant with an atypical FHC had an enlarged left frontal horn cyst with a midline shift on follow up, but he had normal development. Our study suggests that FHC may be a normal physiologic variant or a benign pathologic condition that can be expected to resolve spontaneously within a few months. It is reasonable to follow typical FHC by cranial ultrasound examinations at 1 or 2 and 6 months of age. In the case of an atypical cyst, more frequent follow up and further image studies like CT or MRI are necessary.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chaw-Liang; Chiu, Nan-Chang; Ho, Che-Sheng; Li, Sung-Tse","journal":"Brain and Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ce60ef1556c2ace65a2865134efe0537bdda421.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125929.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0387760406000180; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0387760406000180","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["atypical FHC","atypical cyst","normal development","normal term babies","normal growth","months of age","enlarged left frontal horn cyst","normal physiologic variant","incidence of FHCs","document resolution","children","seven","Abstract Frontal horn cysts","cranial ultrasound examinations","term healthy babies","month period","walled cysts adjacent","tip","benign pathologic condition","anterior horns","image studies","midline shift","MRI","hospital","subsequent ultrasonography","lateral ventricles","year","terms","repeat scan","female","male ratio","case","infant","right","study"],"language":"en"},

The China and the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineages showed much greater genetic divergences than the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage. The present study detected one new monophyletic branch that contained three PDCoVs from China, and this branch was separated from the China lineage but closely related to the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage. The strain CH-HA2-2017, which belongs to this new branch, had a possible recombination event between positions 27 and 1234.

A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity. The availability of a \u201Cuniversal\u201D method to create attenuated viruses for use as vaccine strains would permit a rapid response to outbreaks of newly emerging viruses. Targeting RdRp fidelity has emerged as such a universal approach. However, because polymerase fidelity and speed are inextricably linked, the effort to attribute the attenuated phenotype to a single biochemical property of the RdRp may be futile. Here, we show that this circumstance is even more complex. We provide evidence for the existence of a biochemical parameter that combines with fidelity and speed to govern the mechanism and/or efficiency of recombination. We conclude that the field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp instead of debating the importance of individual properties.","publish_time":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyejeong; Ellis, Victor D.; Woodman, Andrew; Zhao, Yan; Arnold, Jamie J.; Cameron, Craig E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec223563f366aa8ed21ec84d1b0d21a911362cfa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/769224","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RdRp fidelity","PS-KH RdRp","RdRp derivative","PS-KH viruses","polymerase fidelity","importance of recombination","efficiency of recombination","copy-choice recombination","RdRp-coding sequence","unique recombination phenotype","biochemical properties","single biochemical property","background of constant polymerase speed","interwoven nature of speed","attenuated viruses","biochemical parameter","single property","motif-D functions","attenuated phenotype","undefined property","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","emerging viruses","motif-C","fitness","importance of individual properties","twofold of wild type","wild-type enzyme","mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer","universal approach","discovery of manipulatable functions","vaccine strains","general acid","rapid response","viral population","method","poliovirus","P356S","addition","continued emphasis","I331F","outbreaks","PV","double mutant","model system","following substitutions","existence","Lys","elucidation","effort","K359H","enzymes","availability","evidence","cells","context","circumstance","derivatives","field"],"language":"en"},

Polio eradication and elimination of measles and rubella from the Americas is a result of successful collaboration, made possible by timely supply of affordable vaccines. After decades of intense competition for high-value markets, collaboration with developing countries has become critical, and involvement of multiple manufacturers as well as public- and private-sector investments are essential, for developing new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The recent Zika virus outbreak and the accelerated Ebola vaccine development exemplify the need for international partnerships to combat infectious diseases. A new player, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has made its entrance in the global health community, aiming to stimulate research preparedness against emerging infections. Face-to-face panel discussions facilitated the dialogue around challenges, such as risks of viability to vaccine development and regulatory convergence, to improve access to sustainable vaccine supply.

We used a similar approach to study the fusogenic mechanism of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Methods We tested the inhibitory activity against infection of two sets of peptides corresponding to sequences of SARS-CoV spike protein HR1 and HR2 regions and investigated the interactions between the HR1 and HR2 peptides by surface plasmon resonance, sedimentation equilibration analysis, circular dichroism, native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, and computer-aided homology modelling and molecule docking analysis. Findings One peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibited SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range. CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the HR1 region, NP-1. CP-1 alone had low -helicity and self-associated to form a trimer in phosphate buffer (pH 7\u00B72). CP-1 and NP-1 mixed in equimolar concentrations formed a six-helix bundle, similar to the fusogenic core structure of HIV-1 gp41. Interpretation After binding to the target cell, the transmembrane spike protein might change conformation by association between the HR1 and HR2 regions to form an oligomeric structure, leading to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes. At the prefusion intermediate state, CP-1 could bind to the HR1 region and interfere with the conformational changes, resulting in inhibition of SARS-CoV fusion with the target cells. CP-1 might be modifiable to increase its anti-SARS-CoV activity and could be further developed as an antiviral agent for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2004-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shuwen; Xiao, Gengfu; Chen, Yibang; He, Yuxian; Niu, Jinkui; Escalante, Carlos R; Xiong, Huabao; Farmar, James; Debnath, Asim K; Tien, Po; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92b28fb0a43d34081844407727df1dbd2474c7ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140173.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604157887; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673604157887","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CP","CoV fusion","HR1 region","CoV spike protein HR1","HR2 peptides","HR2 regions","inhibited SARS-CoV infection","anti-SARS-CoV activity","prophylaxis of SARS","sequences of SARS","inhibition of SARS","fusion-inhibitory peptides","viral fusogenic mechanism","fusogenic mechanism of severe","sets of peptides","fusogenic core structure of HIV","target-cell membranes","target cells","inhibitory activity","NP","transmembrane spike protein","oligomeric structure","similar approach","sedimentation equilibration analysis","molecule docking analysis","syndrome-associated coronavirus","envelope glycoprotein gp41","native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis","circular dichroism","size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography","surface plasmon resonance","computer-aided homology modelling","crucial information","acute-respiratory","association","trimer","helix bundle","treatment","interactions","equimolar concentrations","Summary Background Studies","conformational changes","phosphate buffer","antiviral agent","low -helicity","high affinity","micromolar range","prefusion intermediate state","Interpretation","binding","heptad","Methods","Findings"],"language":"en"},

It contributes substantially to the use of antimicrobial substances and compromises animal welfare and the sustainability of the cattle industry. The existing preventive measures of BRD focus at the individual animal or herd level and include vaccination, mass treatment with antimicrobials and improvement of the animal\u0027s environment and general health status. Despite progress in our understanding of disease mechanism and technological development, the current preventive measures are not sufficiently effective. Thus, there is a need for alternative, sustainable strategies to combat the disease. Some of the primary infectious agents in the BRD complex are viruses that are easily transmitted between herds such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This conceptual analysis presents arguments for combatting BRD through improved external biosecurity in the cattle herds. As an example of a population-based approach to the control of BRD, the Norwegian BRSV/BCoV control-program is presented. The program is voluntary and launched by the national cattle industry. The core principle is classification of herds based on antibody testing and subsequent prevention of virus-introduction through improved biosecurity measures. Measures include external herd biosecurity barriers and regulations in the organization of animal trade to reduce direct and indirect transmission of virus. Improved biosecurity in a large proportion of herds will lead to a considerable effect at the population level. Positive herds are believed to gain freedom by time if new introduction is avoided. Vaccination is not used as part of the program. Dissemination of information to producers and veterinarians is essential. We believe that reducing the incidence of BRD in cattle is essential and will lead to reduced antimicrobial usage while at the same time improving animal health, welfare and production. Alternative approaches to the traditional control measures are needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stokstad, Maria; Klem, Thea Blystad; Myrmel, Mette; Oma, Veslem\u00F8y Sunniva; Toftaker, Ingrid; \u00D8ster\u00E5s, Olav; N\u00F8dtvedt, Ane","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b689d1cea7756cd990f6c8322a9a75351408135.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154156.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318587/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cattle herds","control of BRD","improved biosecurity measures","BRD complex","animal health","incidence of BRD","existing preventive measures of BRD focus","improved external biosecurity","classification of herds","traditional control measures","Positive herds","current preventive measures","Bovine respiratory disease","BCoV control-program","national cattle industry","individual animal","compromises animal welfare","large proportion of herds","cattle husbandry systems","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","external herd biosecurity barriers","organization of animal trade","herd level","bovine coronavirus","population level","time","vaccination","subsequent prevention of virus","indirect transmission of virus","general health status","understanding of disease mechanism","population-based approach","cause important health problems","Norwegian BRSV","new introduction","Alternative approaches","antimicrobial usage","use of antimicrobial substances","technological development","regulations","improvement","antimicrobials","animal\u0027s environment","antibody testing","mass treatment","freedom","arguments","sustainability","primary infectious agents","producers","veterinarians","sustainable strategies","considerable effect","viruses","Dissemination of information","need","progress","example","core principle","conceptual analysis","production"],"language":"en"},

The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China. Methods A comprehensive search of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention official websites and announcements was performed between 20 Jan 2019 and 29 Feb 2020. The relevant data of the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. Results\u0026 findings Up to 29 Feb 2020, 79,824 confirmed cases with the COVID-19 including 66,907 in Hubei Province and 12,377 in other administrative regions were reported. The SARS-COV-2 showed faster epidemic trends compared with the 2003-SARS-CoV. A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, with a mortality of 3.6%. The mortality of the COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1% versus 0.84%). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased. Conclusions The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Wenjun; Han, Shaolei; Li, Qiang; Zhang, Zhongfa","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dee3d174fc94a900e7f001f6771c64ded546be36.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325276/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302460?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Hubei Province","COVID","different control strategies","administrative regions","number of discharged cases","SARS-COV","different epidemic characteristics","number of discharged patients","Disease Control","different prevention","initial control","higher mortality","confirmed cases","number of hospitalized patients","main epidemic area","faster epidemic trends","infection","China","outbreak","reported day","Abstract Aims","Prevention official websites","Chinese Center","comprehensive search","distribution","announcements","Background","health workers","Methods","study","relevant data","findings","threat","Conclusions","dead","total","deaths","Results","world"],"language":"en"},

Based on molecular testing, we identified a wide repertoire of 160 bacterial species of which 73 have not been previously reported in pneumonia. Moreover, we found 37 putative new bacterial phylotypes with a 16S rDNA gene divergence \u226598% from known phylotypes. We also identified 24 fungal species of which 6 have not been previously reported in pneumonia and 7 viruses. Patients can present up to 16 different microorganisms in a single BAL (mean \u00B1 SD; 3.77\u00B12.93). Some pathogens considered to be typical for ICU pneumonia such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus species can be detected as commonly in controls as in pneumonia patients which strikingly highlights the existence of a core pulmonary microbiota. Differences in the microbiota of different forms of pneumonia were documented.","publish_time":"2012-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bousbia, Sabri; Papazian, Laurent; Saux, Pierre; Forel, Jean Marie; Auffray, Jean-Pierre; Martin, Claude; Raoult, Didier; La Scola, Bernard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ea1978890ab099e90e61ddf078b6d983e60b07f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3289664.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22389704/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0032486","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia patients","aspiration pneumonia","ventilator-associated pneumonia","causative agents of pneumonia","microbiota of different forms of pneumonia","non-ventilator ICU pneumonia","bacterial species","S rDNA genes","S rDNA gene divergence","Streptococcus species","fungal species","controls","core pulmonary microbiota","single BAL","different microorganisms","putative new bacterial phylotypes","known phylotypes","specific pathogens","amoeba co-culture","detection of antibodies","date","community","traditional laboratory diagnostic techniques","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","sequencing","cloning","existence","wide repertoire","bronchoalveolar lavage","PCR","mean","intensive care units","ICUs","results","urinary antigen tests","considerable number of studies","SD","Differences","amplification","molecular testing","three-year period","Samples","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Here, we develop a multiplex cytotoxicity assay that allows direct, simultaneous measurement of up to 23 different specificities of CD8(\u002B) T cells in a single reaction. This can greatly reduce the amount of starting clinical materials for a systematic screening of CD8(\u002B) T cell epitopes. In addition, this greatly enhanced capacity enables the incorporation of irrelevant epitopes for determining the non-specific killing activity of CD8(\u002B) T cells, thereby allowing to measure the actual epitope-specific cytotoxicity activities. This technique is shown to be useful to study both human and mouse CD8(\u002B) T cells. Besides, our results from human PBMCs and three independent infectious animal models (MERS, influenza and malaria) further reveal that IFN\u03B3 expression by epitope-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells does not always correlate with their cell-killing potential, highlighting the need for using cytotoxicity assays in specific contexts (e.g., evaluating vaccine candidates).

Hospitals that have an agile process to evaluate chief complaints of patients seeking emergency care may be able to more quickly identify subtle changes in the community\u0027s health. An easily adaptable prototype system was developed to monitor emergency department patient visits during the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, from April 16\u2013May 14, 2002. Use of the system was continued during the same festival periods in 2003 and 2004. Method Twelve area hospitals in Louisville, Kentucky, participated in a prospective analysis of the chief symptoms of patients who sought care in the emergency department during the Kentucky Derby Festival during 2002. Six hospitals were classified as computer record groups (CRG) and used their existing computerized record capabilities. The other 6 hospitals used a personal digital assistant (PDA) with customized software (PDA group). Data were evaluated by the health department epidemiologist using SaTScan, a modified version of a cancer cluster detection program, to look for clusters of cases above baseline over time and by Zip code. Results All 12 hospitals were able to collect and provide data elements during the study period. The 6 CRG hospitals were able to perform daily data transmission; however, 3 CRG hospitals were unable to interpret their data because it was transmitted in pure text format. In contrast, data from all 6 PDA group hospitals were interpretable. Real-time data analysis was compared with postevent data, and it was found that the real-time evaluation correctly identified no unusual disease activity during the study period. Conclusions The 12 hospitals participating in this study demonstrated that community-wide surveillance using computerized data was possible and that the 6 study hospitals using a PDA could quickly interpret emergency department patients\u0027 chief complaints. The emergency department chief complaints group could serve as a disease sentinel for the community.","publish_time":"2005-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrico, Ruth; Goss, Linda","journal":"Disaster Management \u0026 Response","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acc42865ef5504225e523c8ed7cfebcc15a040f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110958.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540248705000246; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1540248705000246","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kentucky"],"keyphrases":["study hospitals","CRG hospitals","PDA group hospitals","area hospitals","computerized data","data elements","postevent data","emergency department chief complaints group","Real-time data analysis","emergency department patients\u0027 chief complaints","emergency care","daily data transmission","emergency department patient visits","chief complaints of patients","Kentucky Derby Festival","study period","health department epidemiologist","chief symptoms of patients","Louisville","festival periods","community-wide surveillance","disease sentinel","prospective analysis","existing computerized record capabilities","community\u0027s health","real-time evaluation","unusual disease activity","computer record groups","adaptable prototype system","Introduction Electronic syndromic surveillance","modified version","value","emerging pathogens","customized software","cancer cluster detection program","baseline","SaTScan","personal digital assistant","agile process","biological weapons release","clusters of cases","subtle changes","Zip code","Method","pure text format","contrast","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Current preventive measures include the development of a pre-pandemic influenza vaccine and stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors. However, their benefits can be significantly reduced by mutations in the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase resulting in antigenic changes and the appearance of drug-resistance, respectively. Drugs that target the innate immune system to achieve a \u2018heightened antiviral\u2019 state represent another class of antiviral agents that could contribute to the control and treatment of influenza infection. In this study, PIKA (a stabilized dsRNA) provides broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses. In addition, when PIKA was admixed with influenza vaccine preparations, including a formalin-inactivated whole-virion H5 vaccine, significant adjuvanting effect leading to accelerated viral clearance was observed in a murine model. These biological effects appear to be mediated by the ability of PIKA to promote the maturation of dendritic cells, including up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, and the induction of various cytokines and chemokines. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was shown to recognize PIKA in a concentration-dependent manner. The potency and versatility in its activities make PIKA an attractive candidate for use in an influenza pandemic.","publish_time":"2009-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Yuk-Fai; Tang, Lay-Hoon; Ooi, Eng-Eong","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9218063b7a9a4907d674b3284e9eb53a4b9b4d56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115584.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08017751; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08017751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19150474/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.12.048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIKA","Toll-like"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","number of influenza","influenza vaccine preparations","pre-pandemic influenza vaccine","ability of PIKA","pathogenic avian influenza","treatment of influenza infection","possible pandemic","virion H5 vaccine","heightened antiviral","neuraminidase inhibitors","appearance of drug","class of antiviral agents","significant adjuvanting effect","development","HPAI","accelerated viral clearance","formalin-inactivated","attractive candidate","CD80","antigenic changes","state","activities","stabilized dsRNA","broad-spectrum prophylaxis","H5N1","concern","regulation of co-stimulatory molecules","induction of various cytokines","CD86","innate immune system","hemagglutinin","control","maturation of dendritic cells","Current preventive measures","chemokines","Drugs","mutations","TLR3","concentration-dependent manner","versatility","study","murine model","Toll","receptor","potency","resistance","viruses","biological effects"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel","journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398569/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","clinical features of children","outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV","case reports","pediatric case series","perinatal outcomes of neonates","respiratory distress","fewer symptoms","percent of women","pregnancy","common symptoms","date","pneumonia","perinatal deaths","intensive care units","initial reports","severe disease","Fetal distress","strict infection control","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","positive contact history","small number of deaths","prevention procedures","delivery","consolidation","separation of mother","cases","ground-glass opacities","rhinorrhea","recent studies","diarrhea","tachypnoea","bilateral infiltrates","surrounding halo sign","contrast","nasal congestion","Neonatal complications","admission","adults","total","family members","Radiologic findings","cough","vertical transmission","nasopharyngeal secretions","infants","pandemic","Laboratory test parameters","headache","fatigue","mycoplasma","influenza","mean","stool","intravascular coagulation","incubation period","Co-infections","asphyxia","range","globe","review","fever","pharyngitis","mothers","pregnancies"],"language":"en"},

Thus, new antiviral substances obtained from natural products have been prospected, including those derived from venomous animals. Venoms are complex mixtures of hundreds of molecules, mostly peptides, that present a large array of biological activities and evolved to putatively target the biochemical machinery of different pathogens or host cellular structures. In addition, non-venomous compounds, such as some body fluids of invertebrate organisms, exhibit antiviral activity. This review provides a panorama of peptides described from animal venoms that present antiviral activity, thereby reinforcing them as important tools for the development of new therapeutic drugs.","publish_time":"2017-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Mata, \u00C9lida Cleyse Gomes; Mour\u00E3o, Caroline Barbosa Farias; Rangel, Marisa; Schwartz, Elisabeth Ferroni","journal":"J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/914b5fc6d3984b981a1e36e545cc2a74e3fbd58a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5217322.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074089/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40409-016-0089-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["present antiviral activity","host cellular structures","host cells","panorama of peptides","new antiviral substances","Viruses","host cellular immune defense","virus-coded peptides","non-venomous compounds","large number of compounds","animal venoms","viral vaccines","venomous animals","various viral infections","development of new therapeutic drugs","large array of biological activities","biochemical machinery of different pathogens","disease progression","body fluids of invertebrate organisms","complex mixtures of hundreds","important tools","molecules","rapid mutational capacity","natural products","discovery","great variety of diseases","addition","effective agents","review"],"language":"en"},

Two new technologies \u2013 pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) and Big Data analytics \u2013 promise to improve our capacity to detect and control outbreaks earlier, saving lives and resources. However, routinely using these technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information could be perceived as intrusive and a threat to privacy. METHOD: making pathogen WGS and linked administrative data available for public health research; using this information in concert with data linkage and machine learning to enhance communicable disease surveillance systems. Fifty participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited by random-digit-dialling and topic-blinded social-media advertising. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence supporting different expert perspectives on the potential benefits and costs of technologically enhanced public health research and communicable disease surveillance and given the opportunity to question experts. RESULTS: Almost all jurors supported data linkage and WGS on routinely collected patient isolates for the purposes of public health research, provided standard de-identification practices were applied. However, allowing this information to be operationalised as a syndromic surveillance system was highly contentious with three juries voting in favour, and one against by narrow margins. For those in favour, support depended on several conditions related to system oversight and security being met. Those against were concerned about loss of privacy and did not trust Australian governments to run secure and effective systems. CONCLUSIONS: Participants across all four events strongly supported the introduction of data linkage and pathogenomics to public health research under current research governance structures. Combining pathogen WGS with event-based data surveillance systems, however, is likely to be controversial because of a lack of public trust, even when the potential public health benefits are clear. Any suggestion of private sector involvement or commercialisation of WGS or surveillance data was unanimously rejected.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Degeling, Chris; Carter, Stacy M.; van Oijen, Antoine M.; McAnulty, Jeremy; Sintchenko, Vitali; Braunack-Mayer, Annette; Yarwood, Trent; Johnson, Jane; Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.","journal":"BMC Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78c8f4382dc2ef919751db56a8cf447795099f0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183724.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-020-00474-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Data","WGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance data","purposes of public health research","potential public health benefits","pathogen WGS","introduction of data linkage","costly health","event-based data surveillance systems","communicable disease surveillance systems","commercialisation of WGS","administrative data available","lack of public trust","Big Data analytics","syndromic surveillance system","current research governance structures","potential benefits","effective systems","favour","specific personal information","Outbreaks of infectious disease cause serious","social problems","control outbreaks","system oversight","new technologies","loss of privacy","participants of diverse backgrounds","topic-blinded social-media advertising","different expert perspectives","pathogenomics","genome sequencing","ages","balanced factual evidence","machine","costs","mixed genders","standard de-identification practices","conditions","suggestion of private sector involvement","patient isolates","concert","Australian governments","random-digit","events","opportunity","jurors","jury","lives","security","capacity","juries","threat","CONCLUSIONS","support","resources","RESULTS","METHOD","narrow margins","experts"],"language":"en"},

Most were from patients clinically diagnosed with H1N1/2009. Out of these, 9% were positive. This study sought to determine what respiratory pathogens were misdiagnosed as cases of H1N1/2009 during this time. METHODS: We examined the results from 3247 samples which were sent to the laboratory during April-July 2009. All were from patients clinically diagnosed as having H1N1/2009 (based on accepted criteria) and all were given a full respiratory screen using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) assays. RESULTS: In total, respiratory pathogens were detected in 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 26.3-29.5%) of the samples submitted. Numerous pathogens were detected, the most common of which were rhinovirus (8.9% (95% confidence interval, 7.9-9.9%)), parainfluenza 1 (1.9% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.4%)) and 3 (4.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.3-4.9%)), and adenovirus ((3.5% (95% confidence interval, 2.9-4.2%)). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the problems of using a clinical algorithm to detect H1N1/2009. Clinicians frequently misdiagnosed common respiratory pathogens as H1N1/2009 during the spring/summer outbreak in Scotland. Many undesirable consequences would have resulted, relating to treatment, infection control, and public health surveillance.","publish_time":"2011-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunson, Rory N; Carman, William F","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7f717457621e576d69c56b61d9ad9bd52a8a8b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3146830.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Glasgow","Scotland"],"keyphrases":["confidence interval","outbreak of H1N1","cases of H1N1","misdiagnosed common respiratory pathogens","respiratory screen","Numerous pathogens","clinical samples","results","study","patients","clinical algorithm","summer outbreak","West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre","real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","rtRT-PCR","infection control","WoSSVC","Glasgow","public health surveillance","problems","spring","Clinicians","treatment","assays","total","CONCLUSIONS","accepted criteria","undesirable consequences","METHODS","rhinovirus","laboratory","parainfluenza","adenovirus","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Then, IBV-induced apoptosis was observed through a cell viability assay, morphological changes, and flow cytometry. The activity of caspases, the inhibitory efficacy of caspase-inhibitors and the expression of apoptotic genes further suggested the activation of apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in IBV-infected HD11 cells. Additionally, ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) pretreated HD11 cells blocked IBV from entering cells and inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis. UV-inactivated IBV also lost the ability of apoptosis induction. IBV replication was increased by blocking caspase activation.

METHODS: Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. RESULTS: Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise.

Source organisms were selected to mirror communities described in the Human Microbiome Project as well as the emerging pathogens listed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The six in silico datasets were used to evaluate the performance of six leading metagenomics algorithms: MetaScope, Kraken, LMAT, MetaPhlAn, MetaCV, and MetaPhyler. Results Algorithms were evaluated on runtime, true positive organisms identified to the genus and species levels, false positive organisms identified to genus and species level, read mapping, relative abundance estimation, and gene calling. No algorithm out performed the others in all categories, and the algorithm or algorithms of choice strongly depends on analysis goals. MetaPhlAn excels for bacteria and LMAT for viruses. The algorithms were ranked by overall performance using a normalized weighted sum of the above metrics, and MetaScope emerged as the overall winner, followed by Kraken and LMAT. Conclusions Simulated FASTQ datasets with well-characterized truth data about microbial community composition reveal numerous insights about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the metagenomics algorithms evaluated. The simulated datasets are available to download from the Sequence Read Archive (SRP062063).","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shcherbina, Anna; Ricke, Darrell O.; Chiu, Nelson","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6452b32b7d461645f31564240f3b289b9cc2d07d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a59906b732bf4a489e282c3e4f499d4166c622e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/046532","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral datasets","Results Algorithms","available metagenomics algorithms","weaknesses of available algorithms","algorithms of choice","silico datasets","simulated datasets","human truth datasets","FASTQ datasets","Sequenced datasets","leading metagenomics algorithms","read","gene identification capabilities of available algorithms","refinement of metagenomic algorithms","viral organism identification","background organisms","Source organisms","LMAT","Algorithm performance","true positive organisms","overall performance","silico bacterial","false positive organisms","true source organism","genus","relative strengths","mapping","Kraken","MetaScope","MetaPhlAn","well-characterized truth data","species levels","overall winner","relative abundance estimation","Human Microbiome Project","microbial community composition","numerous insights","ambiguity","National Institute of Allergy","decision makers","normalized weighted sum","communities","runtime","emerging pathogens","Infectious Diseases","metrics","development","Conclusions","MetaCV","resource","characterization","staggered coverage","analysis goals","Archive","SRP062063","MetaPhyler","viruses","categories"],"language":"en"},

This report describes the secular trends in HCAI at the NTUH over the past 27 years according to site of infection, aetiological agents and control measures. Clinical and microbiological data were collected by infection prevention and control nurses using a standardised case-record form. Specific control programmes were implemented and/or intensified as needed. Poisson or negative binomial regression analysis was used to quantify time trends of the incidence of HCAI. The annual number of discharges increased from 25 074 to 91 234 with a parallel increase in the Charlson comorbidity index. Active HCAI surveillance and periodic feedback were associated with a marked decrease in surgical site infections from 1981 to 2007 (2.5 vs 0.5 episodes per 100 procedures, P \u003C0.0001). On the other hand, there was a 4.8-fold increase in bloodstream infections (BSIs) (0.39 vs 1.88 episodes per 100 discharges, P \u003C0.0001). The average annual increase of pathogen-specific HCAI incidence during 1981\u20132007 was 11.4% for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 75.4% for extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDRAB), and 7.5% for Candida albicans (P \u003C0.0001, respectively). The infection prevention and control programme was upgraded in 2004 by implementing annual, intensive, project-based control programmes, and decreases in rates of HCAI, BSI, MRSA and XDRAB were observed. This long term study demonstrates the need to couple surveillance of HCAI with focused control programmes. Hospitals must invest in adequate manpower to accomplish these goals.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuang, Y.-C.; Chen, Y.-C.; Chang, S.-C.; Sun, C.-C.; Chang, Y.-Y.; Chen, M.-L.; Hsu, L.-Y.; Wang, J.-T.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3431b01ad4a2019082a6c96b25c010c9ca88a0e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114588.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2010.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670110002318; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670110002318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Taiwan University Hospital","HCAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance of HCAI","incidence of HCAI","control nurses","control of healthcare","rates of HCAI","control measures","Specific control programmes","Active HCAI surveillance","specific HCAI incidence","focused control programmes","site of infection","infection prevention","project-based control programmes","associated infection","NTUH","parallel increase","fold increase","average annual increase of pathogen","MRSA","episodes","vs","XDRAB","annual number of discharges","surgical site infections","bloodstream infections","time trends","secular trends","drug-resistant","meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","BSIs","international guidelines","National Taiwan University Hospital","marked decrease","periodic feedback","need","aetiological agents","negative binomial regression analysis","standardised case-record form","Poisson","Summary","Charlson comorbidity index","microbiological data","years","long term study","adequate manpower","baumannii","report","procedures","Hospitals","goals","Candida albicans","hand"],"language":"en"},

This is the second most deadly EVD outbreak in history, after the one that occurred in West Africa in 2014. The DRC Ministry of Health (MoH), supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a range of regional and international partners, are implementing EVD response plans in these affected areas such as screening of suspect cases at points of entry, case detection, contact tracing, laboratory testing, case management and infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, ring vaccination (this involves vaccination of infected individuals, direct contacts of infected individuals and contacts of their contacts), and therapeutics, community mobilization and free access to healthcare services. Despite these efforts, there has been a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases within the identified affected areas, and due to a number of challenges unique to DRC, there has been an expansion in the geographical extent of transmission. The significance of the proximity of these regions to wildlife and the Virunga National Park is questionable in the EVD transmission dynamics. The close interaction between human, animal, and environmental factors, in combination with high population movement due to regular rebel attacks in these regions, suggest the need for the integration of the One Health approach in the holistic response plans for control and prevention of EVD.

Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer\u2019s rank model, Fotheringham\u2019s competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer\u2019s rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer\u2019s model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets. Author summary The ability to predict how infectious disease will spread is of great importance in the face of the numerous emergent and re-emergent pathogens that currently threatening human well-being. We identified a variety of alternative models that predict human mobility as as a function of population distribution across a landscape. These consider some models that account for pair-wise interactions between population centers, as well as some that allow for higher-order interactions. We trained the models using a uniquely rich spatiotemporal data set on pre-vaccination measles in England and wales (1944-65), which comprises more than a million records from 954 cities and towns. Likelihood rankings of the different models reveal strong evidence for higher-order interactions in the form of competition among cities as destinations for travelers and, thus, dilution of spatial transmission.

Predominantly, IBV causes clinical signs associated with respiratory or kidney disease, which subsequently cause an increase in mortality rate. Three of the current vaccines belong to the same subgroup (subgroup 1), however, the VicS vaccine has been reported to cause an increased vaccinal reaction compared to the other subgroup 1 vaccines. Molecular anomalies detected in VicS suggested the presence of two major subspecies, VicS-v and VicS-del, present in the commercial preparation of VicS. The most notable anomaly is the absence of a 40 bp sequence in the 3\u2032UTR of VicS-del. In this investigation, the two subspecies were isolated and shown to grow independently and to similar titres in embryonated chicken eggs. An in vivo investigation involved 5 groups of 20 chickens each and found that VicS-del grew to a significantly lesser extent in the chicken tissues collected than did VicS-v. The group inoculated with an even ratio of the isolated subspecies scored the most severe clinical signs, with the longest duration. These results indicate the potential for a cooperative, instead of an expected competitive, relationship between VicS-v and VicS-del to infect a host, which is reminiscent of RNA viral quasi-species.","publish_time":"2012-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hewson, Kylie A.; Scott, Peter C.; Devlin, Joanne M.; Ignjatovic, Jagoda; Noormohammadi, Amir H.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c12218076acf8b30d83de43257cc18b18a4ddf64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115607.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X12005907; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.04.054; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12005907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22542436/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["VicS-v","UTR of VicS","VicS vaccine","commercial preparation of VicS","subgroup","isolated subspecies","chickens","major subspecies","IBV","available vaccines","investigation","current vaccines","severe clinical signs","chicken tissues","embryonated chicken eggs","Australia","relationship","presence","infectious bronchitis virus","reminiscent of RNA viral quasi-species","absence","similar titres","kidney disease","longest duration","bp sequence","lesser extent","host","increased vaccinal reaction","Molecular anomalies","mortality rate","notable anomaly","results","potential","groups","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

A total of 9,107 patients visited the ED during this period. Of these patients, 2,572 (28.2%) were pediatric patients and 6,535 (71.8%) were adult patients. The most common cause of an ED visit was fever (adult patients: 21.6%, pediatric patients: 56.2%). The proportion of non-urgent visits involving an ESI level of 4 or 5 and the EDLOS decreased significantly in pediatric and adult patients in comparison to that during the past two years. This change was significant in pediatric patients. Among adult patients, the rate of injury decreased, whereas it increased among pediatric patients. During the MERS outbreak period, pediatric ED visits due to non-urgent cases decreased significantly and there were more pronounced differences in ED utilization patterns in pediatric patients than in adult patients.","publish_time":"2017-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paek, So Hyun; Kim, Do Kyun; Lee, Jin Hee; Kwak, Young Ho","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76cbada4dbb0c067cbffac6a1f1cede25aec708b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5592169.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875599/; https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2017.32.10.1576","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["pediatric patients","adult patients","pediatric ED visits","patterns of adult","ED utilization patterns","MERS outbreak period","patterns of visits","patterns of utilization","non-injury","cause of visit","rate of injury","proportion of non-urgent visits","emergency department","ESI level","non-urgent cases","Changes","EDLOS","retrospective study","emergency medical services","emergency severity index","common cause","hospitalization rate","Middle East respiratory syndrome","final dispositions","diagnosis","fever","patients\u0027 characteristics","pronounced differences","tertiary teaching hospital","length","comparison","Korea","total","years","purpose","periods"],"language":"en"},

The onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, ranks as one of the world\u2019s most destructive agricultural pests and commonly found in imported agricultural products and field samples, but is prone to undetected transport because of its minute size as well as cryptic behavior. Although traditional taxonomic methods are pretty useful in straightforward assignment of specimens to the genus Thrips , identification in the species level is much more difficult and requires expertise, knowledge, and experience. Furthermore, it is often difficult or impossible to identify or distinguish this species from other thrips by using material from other stages of development. Based on the foregoings, use of a molecular technique known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a rapid and robust alternative species diagnostic tool would be valuable. In this study, a relatively quick and simple method was used to detect the presence of onion thrips DNA rapidly and discriminate it from other species, by using material from different stages of development. Not only LAMP itself required less than 1 h to complete but also amounts of DNA as little as that recovered from a single specimen were adequate for the detection. Another advantage of this identification system is that nonspecialists will be able to make faster and cheaper identifications.","publish_time":"2015-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fekrat, Lida; Zaki Aghl, Mohammad; Tahan, Vahid","journal":"J Econ Entomol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55cfaf52dbdcfa267e022d1ee8d61bfec113ad5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109851.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26470262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genus Thrips","species level","presence of onion thrips DNA","Thrips tabaci Lindeman","identification system","accurate identification","material","LAMP","different stages of development","robust alternative species diagnostic tool","agricultural products","destructive agricultural pests","environmental damage","high economic losses","straightforward assignment of specimens","invasive taxa","minute size","loop","undetected transport","field samples","traditional taxonomic methods","isothermal amplification","nonspecialists","molecular technique","critical importance","single specimen","detection","simple method","cheaper identifications","cryptic behavior","expertise","knowledge","world\u2019s","study","experience","foregoings","advantage"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective randomized study. All patients undergoing FOB-guided nasal tracheal intubation were randomized to bag-valve-mask ventilation or NIV for preoxygenation followed by intubation. The NIV group were intubated through a sealed hole in a specially designed face mask during continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen. Control patients were intubated with removal of the mask and no ventilatory support. RESULTS: We enrolled 106 patients, including 53 in each group. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) after preoxygenation (99% (96%\u2013100%) vs. 96% (90%\u201399%), p = .001) and minimum SpO(2) during intubation (95% (87%\u2013100%) vs. 83% (74%\u201391%), p \u003C .01) were both significantly higher in the NIV compared with the control group.

Since s2m is such an extremely conserved motif, it is an ideal target for screening for viruses harbouring it. In this study, we have detected and characterized novel viruses harbouring this motif in pigeons by using a s2m-specific amplification. 84% and 67% of the samples from feral pigeons and wood pigeons, respectively, were found to contain a virus harbouring s2m. Four novel viruses were identified and characterized. Two of the new viruses belong to the genus Avastrovirus in the Astroviridae family. We propose two novel species to be included in this genus, Feral pigeon astrovirus and Wood pigeon astrovirus. Two other novel viruses, Pigeon picornavirus A and Pigeon picornavirus B, belong to the Picornaviridae family, presumably to the genus Sapelovirus. Both of the novel picornaviruses harboured two adjacent s2m, called (s2m)(2), suggesting a possible increased functional effect of s2m when present in two copies.","publish_time":"2011-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kofstad, Tone; Jonassen, Christine M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c16b3804d97765832da8ea7579a114e98844c0ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3197151.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wood"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel viruses","adjacent s2m","genomes of viruses","new viruses","novel species","conserved motif","s2m-specific amplification","novel picornaviruses","Feral pigeon astrovirus","Wood pigeon astrovirus","conserved RNA-motif","feral pigeons","wood pigeons","Pigeon picornavirus B","possible increased functional effect of s2m","genus Avastrovirus","Astroviridae family","Picornaviridae family","genus Sapelovirus","bird species","different RNA virus families","broad range of mammal","unknown function","present","ideal target","samples","stem-loop","Coronaviridae","Caliciviridae","screening","end","copies","study"],"language":"en"},

Mixed infections with Chlamydia and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) may result in generation of persistent chlamydial infections. To test this hypothesis, an in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum in Vero cells was established. RESULTS: Infected cultures were investigated by immunofluorescence (IF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and re-infection experiments. By IF, Chlamydia-infected cells showed normal inclusions after 39 hpi. Dual infections with Chlamydia abortus revealed a heterogenous mix of inclusion types including small inclusions consisting of aberrant bodies (ABs), medium-sized inclusions consisting of ABs and reticulate bodies and normal inclusions. Only aberrant inclusions were observable in dual infection experiments with Chlamydia pecorum and PEDV. TEM examinations of mixed infections with Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum revealed aberrant chlamydial inclusions containing reticulate-like, pleomorphic ABs, which were up to 2 \u03BCm in diameter. No re-differentiation into elementary bodies (EBs) was detected. In re-infection experiments, co-infected cells produced fewer EBs than monoinfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we confirm that PEDV co-infection alters the developmental cycle of member species of the family Chlamydiaceae, in a similar manner to other well-described persistence induction methods. Interestingly, this effect appears to be partially species-specific as Chlamydia pecorum appears more sensitive to PEDV co-infection than Chlamydia abortus, as evidenced by TEM and IF observations of a homogenous population of aberrant inclusions in PEDV - Chlamydia pecorum co-infections.","publish_time":"2010-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borel, Nicole; Dumrese, Claudia; Ziegler, Urs; Schifferli, Andrea; Kaiser, Carmen; Pospischil, Andreas","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b0d5260ad731335898da719538d30d414a9e39f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2919482.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663197/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-10-201","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","TEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chlamydia abortus","PEDV - Chlamydia pecorum co-infections","Chlamydia-infected cells","PEDV co-infection","normal inclusions","Dual infections","aberrant chlamydial inclusions","small inclusions","dual infection experiments","re-infection experiments","persistent infections","co-infected cells","aberrant bodies","model of dual infection","homogenous population of aberrant inclusions","medium-sized inclusions","TEM examinations of mixed infections","generation of persistent chlamydial infections","monoinfected cells","Vero cells","reticulate bodies","cell culture-adapted PEDV","Infected cultures","elementary bodies","re-differentiation","pleomorphic ABs","fewer EBs","similar manner","heterogenous mix of inclusion types","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","developmental cycle of member species","family Chlamydiaceae","observable","well-described persistence induction methods","humans","transmission electron microscopy","wide range of chronic diseases","present study","immunofluorescence","observations","animals","BACKGROUND","Chlamydiae","hpi","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","hypothesis","\u03BCm","diameter","effect"],"language":"en"},

How membranes are remodeled and what properties make them conducive for replication are unknown. Here we show how RNA viruses can manipulate multiple components of the cellular secretory pathway to generate organelles specialized for replication that are distinct in protein and lipid composition from the host cell. Specific viral proteins modulate effector recruitment by Arf1 GTPase and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, promoting preferential recruitment of phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase III\u03B2 (PI4KIII\u03B2) to membranes over coat proteins, yielding uncoated phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) lipid-enriched organelles. The PI4P-rich lipid microenvironment is essential for both enteroviral and flaviviral RNA replication; PI4KIII\u03B2 inhibition interferes with this process; and enteroviral RNA polymerases specifically bind PI4P. These findings reveal how RNA viruses can selectively exploit specific elements of the host to form specialized organelles where cellular phosphoinositide lipids are key to regulating viral RNA replication.

Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010\u20132019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, highlight that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated April 27, 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus.

Surprisingly, the glycoproteins retained in the ER were rapidly processed by cis/medial Golgi enzymes but not by trans Golgi enzymes. An explanation for these observations was provided from morphological studies at both the light and electron microscopic levels using markers for the cis/medial and trans Golgi. They revealed a rapid and dramatic redistribution to the ER of components of the cis/medial but not the trans Golgi in response to treatment with BFA. Upon removal of BFA, the morphology of the Golgi apparatus was rapidly reestablished and proteins normally transported out of the ER were efficiently and rapidly sorted to their final destinations. These results suggest that BFA disrupts a dynamic membrane-recycling pathway between the ER and cis/medial Golgi, effectively blocking membrane transport out of but not back to the ER.","publish_time":"1989-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lippincott-Schwartz, Jennifer; Yuan, Lydia C.; Bonifacino, Juan S.; Klausner, Richard D.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a581b86b06b3e62dae9b13aa9cc910119f9f6513.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867489906855; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867489906855","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Golgi apparatus","medial Golgi enzymes","trans Golgi enzymes","ER of components","removal of BFA","synthesized membrane proteins","dynamic membrane-recycling pathway","light","markers","endoplasmic reticulum","electron microscopic levels","movement","brefeldin","dramatic redistribution","morphology","response","treatment","morphological studies","observations","cells","Abstract","results","final destinations","explanation","glycoproteins"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, we analyzed the alterations in cecal microorganism composition in chickens using 16S rRNA-seq. Integrated analysis of these three phenotypic datasets further managed to create correlations between the altered kidney transcriptomes and metabolome, and between kidney metabolome and gut microbiome. We found that 2868 genes and 160 metabolites were deferentially expressed or accumulated in the kidney during NIBV infection processes. These genes and metabolites were linked to NIBV-infection related processes, including immune response, signal transduction, peroxisome, purine, and amino acid metabolism. In addition, the comprehensive correlations between the kidney metabolome and cecal microbial community showed contributions of gut microbiota in the progression of NIBV-infection.

Is it those who wrote the regulations, those enforcing the regulations, those being regulated or the science underpinning the regulations? In seeking answers to these questions, this paper explores the regulatory process and the contribution of science. It takes as examples the role of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) in regulating veterinary products, of the Security Sensitive Biological Agents regulations in managing the risks from specific pathogens, the Quarantine Act regulations as applied to containment facilities and the development of welfare standards. By dealing with products, pathogens, places and \u201Cpets\u201D it provides a broad oversight of how regulations have been developed and applied from different perspectives and highlights the differing roles that science and research play both in developing policy and regulations. What is clear is that in the presence of good science it is usually possible to develop sound and defensible regulations e.g. those managed by APVMA, but when there is a lack of science to underpin the regulations, problems can arise e.g. in the case of animal welfare.","publish_time":"2014-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeggo, Martyn","journal":"J Verbrauch Lebensm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9e7e99d058c1fffd687046fe2999ebdba9edd65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079758.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00003-014-0889-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Security Sensitive Biological Agents"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["defensible regulations","Quarantine Act regulations","Security Sensitive Biological Agents regulations","contribution of science","lack of science","presence of good science","veterinary products","APVMA","specific pathogens","Veterinary Medicines Authority","development of welfare standards","case of animal welfare","research play","differing roles","containment facilities","risks","Australian Pesticides","regulatory process","developing policy","paper","pets","questions","different perspectives","places","broad oversight","sound","problems","answers","fault","life","basis"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated whether syndromic surveillance detects local outbreaks of lower-respiratory infections (LRIs) without swamping true signals by false alarms. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using retrospective hospitalization data, we simulated prospective surveillance for LRI-elevations. Between 1999\u20132006, a total of 290762 LRIs were included by date of hospitalization and patients place of residence (\u003E80% coverage, 16 million population). Two large outbreaks of Legionnaires disease in the Netherlands were used as positive controls to test whether these outbreaks could have been detected as local LRI elevations. We used a space-time permutation scan statistic to detect LRI clusters. We evaluated how many LRI-clusters were detected in 1999\u20132006 and assessed likely causes for the cluster-signals by looking for significantly higher proportions of specific hospital discharge diagnoses (e.g. Legionnaires disease) and overlap with regional influenza elevations. We also evaluated whether the number of space-time signals can be reduced by restricting the scan statistic in space or time. In 1999\u20132006 the scan-statistic detected 35 local LRI clusters, representing on average 5 clusters per year. The known Legionnaires\u0027 disease outbreaks in 1999 and 2006 were detected as LRI-clusters, since cluster-signals were generated with an increased proportion of Legionnaires disease patients (p:\u003C0.0001). 21 other clusters coincided with local influenza and/or respiratory syncytial virus activity, and 1 cluster appeared to be a data artifact. For 11 clusters no likely cause was defined, some possibly representing as yet undetected LRI-outbreaks. With restrictions on time and spatial windows the scan statistic still detected the Legionnaires\u0027 disease outbreaks, without loss of timeliness and with less signals generated in time (up to 42% decline). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study that systematically evaluates the performance of space-time syndromic surveillance with nationwide high coverage data over a longer period. The results show that syndromic surveillance can detect local LRI-outbreaks in a timely manner, independent of laboratory-based outbreak detection. Furthermore, since comparatively few new clusters per year were observed that would prompt investigation, syndromic hospital-surveillance could be a valuable tool for detection of local LRI-outbreaks.","publish_time":"2010-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Wijngaard, Cees C.; van Asten, Liselotte; van Pelt, Wilfrid; Doornbos, Gerda; Nagelkerke, Nico J.

The aims of this study were to determine the overall distribution of respiratory viruses in neonates hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infectiosns (ALRI) and to describe the clinical characteristics of RSV infections in these neonates. METHODS: From January 2009 through May 2010, neonates aged \u003C1 month who were hospitalized with ALRI and did not have underlying disease were included in the study. Viruses were identified on multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using nasal swab samples. Clinical variables were evaluated between the RSV and non\u2010RSV infection groups. RESULTS: Of the 108 infants included in the study, 46 (42.6%) had RSV; human rhinovirus (18.5%), human parainfluenza virus 3 (7.5%), and human metapneumovirus (3.7%) were the next most common infections. Codetections accounted for 8.3% of the cases. Crowding increased the risk of RSV infection compared to the non\u2010RSV group (OR, 16.5; P = 0.001). The RSV group had a greater incidence of dyspnea (P = 0.027), pneumonia (P \u003C 0.001), requirement for oxygen (P \u003C 0.001), and prolonged hospitalization (P = 0.011) than the non\u2010RSV group. CONCLUSIONS: RSV was the most common viral etiology in neonates without underlying diseases who were hospitalized with ALRI. The disease severity of RSV infection was worse than that of other detected viral infections.

FCoV and CCoV are each subdivided into two serotypes, FCoV-I/II and CCoV-I/II. A phylogenetic relationship is evident between, on one hand, CCoV-I/FCoV-I, and on the other hand, CCoV-II/FCoV-II, suggesting that interspecies transmission can occur. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of coronavirus (CoV)-infected cats according to their contact with dogs and to genetically analyse the CoV strains infecting cats. From 2003 to 2009, we collected 88 faecal samples from healthy cats and 11 ascitic fluids from FIP cats. We investigated the possible contact with dog in the household and collected dogs samples if appropriate. Out of 99 cat samples, 26 were coronavirus positive, with six cats living with at least one dog, thus showing that contact with dogs does not appear as a predisposing factor for cats CoV infections. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of FCoV strains were conducted using partial N and S sequences. Six divergent strains were identified with the N gene clustering with CCoV-I whereas the 3\u2032 end of S was related to FCoV-I. Further analysis on those six samples was attempted by researching the presence of the ORF3 gene, the latter being peculiar to CCoV-I to date. We succeeded to amplify the ORF3 gene in five samples out of six. Thus, our data strongly suggest the circulation of atypical FCoV strains harbouring the CCoV-I ORF3 gene among cats. Moreover, the ORF3 genes recovered from the feline strains exhibited shared deletions, never described before, suggesting that these deletions could be critical in the adaptation of these strains to the feline host.","publish_time":"2013-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le Poder, Sophie; Pham-Hung d\u2019Alexandry d\u2019Orangiani, Anne-Laure; Duarte, Lidia; Fournier, Annie; Horhogea, Cristina; Pinhas, Carine; Vabret, Astrid; Eloit, Marc","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a92e70c0a129a56173ef38bf186c1cd7ecfe6d9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106123.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.09.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121017/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813003651; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813003651","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCoV-","CCoV","FIP cats","feline strains","healthy cats","infected cats","dogs samples","cats CoV infections","phylogenetic analyses of FCoV strains","circulation of atypical FCoV strains","divergent strains","common pathogens of cats","cat samples","faecal samples","feline host","ORF3 genes","N gene clustering","feline infectious peritonitis","prevalence of coronavirus","coronavirus positive","possible contact","hand","canine pantropic coronavirus infection","lethal infections","partial N","canine coronaviruses","S sequences","phylogenetic relationship","shared deletions","end of S","household","ascitic fluids","predisposing factor","adaptation","present study","presence","aim","data","date","analysis","serotypes","interspecies transmission"],"language":"en"},

In addition, the risk of a virulent and lethal influenza pandemic has generated widespread and warranted concern. Currently licensed influenza vaccines are limited in their ability to induce efficacious and long-lasting herd immunity. In addition, and as evidenced by the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, there can be a significant delay between the emergence of a pandemic influenza and an effective, antibody-inducing vaccine. There is, therefore, a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection\u2014obviating the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. Development of such a vaccine would yield enormous health benefits to society and also greatly reduce the associated global healthcare burden. There are a number of alternative influenza vaccine technologies being assessed both preclinically and clinically. In this review we discuss viral vectored vaccines, either recombinant live-attenuated or replication-deficient viruses, which are current lead candidates for inducing efficacious and long-lasting immunity toward influenza viruses. These alternate influenza vaccines offer real promise to deliver viable alternatives to currently deployed vaccines and more importantly may confer long-lasting and universal protection against influenza viral infection.","publish_time":"2012-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambe, Teresa","journal":"Molecular Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbcfbfc9f70250c918a6d75a049914544dc6ee3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3510293.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2119/molmed.2012.00147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","influenza viruses","alternate influenza vaccines","licensed influenza vaccines","efficacious vaccines","lethal influenza pandemic","influenza viral infection","biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines","deployed vaccines","viral vectored vaccines","number of alternative influenza vaccine technologies","long-lasting immunity","long-lasting herd immunity","associated global healthcare burden","H1N1 pandemic","addition","substantial global healthcare burden","significant associated mortality","universal protection","continued need","significant delay","cross-clade protection","replication-deficient viruses","real promise","current lead candidates","viable alternatives","ability","annual epidemics","cases of severe illness","society","enormous health benefits","risk","emergence","antibody","warranted concern","review","Development"],"language":"en"},

In this retrospective study, data on bats submitted for rabies testing were analysed in order to better understand the epidemiology of EBLV-1 in bats in France and to investigate some epidemiological trends. Of the 3176 bats submitted for rabies diagnosis from 1989 to 2013, 1.96% (48/2447 analysed) were diagnosed positive. Among the twelve recognised virus species within the Lyssavirus genus, two species were isolated in France. 47 positive bats were morphologically identified as Eptesicus serotinus and were shown to be infected by both the EBLV-1a and the EBLV-1b lineages. Isolation of BBLV in Myotis nattereri was reported once in the north-east of France in 2012. The phylogenetic characterisation of all 47 French EBLV-1 isolates sampled between 1989 and 2013 and the French BBLV sample against 21 referenced partial nucleoprotein sequences confirmed the low genetic diversity of EBLV-1 despite its extensive geographical range. Statistical analysis performed on the serotine bat data collected from 1989 to 2013 showed seasonal variation of rabies occurrence with a significantly higher proportion of positive samples detected during the autumn compared to the spring and the summer period (34% of positive bats detected in autumn, 15% in summer, 13% in spring and 12% in winter).

It was neglected until a major outbreak occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, in 2007. Teratogenic effects resulting in microcephaly in newborn infants is the greatest public health threat. In 2016, the Zika virus epidemic was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Consequently, mathematical models were constructed to explicitly elucidate related transmission dynamics. SURVEY METHODOLOGY: In this review article, two steps of journal article searching were performed. First, we attempted to identify mathematical models previously applied to the study of vector-borne diseases using the search terms \u201Cdynamics,\u201D \u201Cmathematical model,\u201D \u201Cmodeling,\u201D and \u201Cvector-borne\u201D together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika. Then the identified types of model were further investigated. Second, we narrowed down our survey to focus on only Zika virus research. The terms we searched for were \u201Ccompartmental,\u201D \u201Cspatial,\u201D \u201Cmetapopulation,\u201D \u201Cnetwork,\u201D \u201Cindividual-based,\u201D \u201Cagent-based\u201D AND \u201CZika.\u201D All relevant studies were included regardless of the year of publication. We have collected research articles that were published before August 2017 based on our search criteria. In this publication survey, we explored the Google Scholar and PubMed databases. RESULTS: We found five basic model architectures previously applied to vector-borne virus studies, particularly in Zika virus simulations. These include compartmental, spatial, metapopulation, network, and individual-based models. We found that Zika models carried out for early epidemics were mostly fit into compartmental structures and were less complicated compared to the more recent ones. Simple models are still commonly used for the timely assessment of epidemics. Nevertheless, due to the availability of large-scale real-world data and computational power, recently there has been growing interest in more complex modeling frameworks. DISCUSSION: Mathematical models are employed to explore and predict how an infectious disease spreads in the real world, evaluate the disease importation risk, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. As the trends in modeling of infectious diseases have been shifting towards data-driven approaches, simple and complex models should be exploited differently. Simple models can be produced in a timely fashion to provide an estimation of the possible impacts. In contrast, complex models integrating real-world data require more time to develop but are far more realistic. The preparation of complicated modeling frameworks prior to the outbreaks is recommended, including the case of future Zika epidemic preparation.","publish_time":"2018-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiratsudakul, Anuwat; Suparit, Parinya; Modchang, Charin","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5d836ef3f064ed0bf47d2fa690786815ad26659.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5866925.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593941/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4526","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar"],"locations":["Micronesia","West Nile"],"keyphrases":["Zika models","mathematical models","complex models","Simple models","Zika virus epidemic","Zika virus research","individual-based models","Zika virus simulations","virus studies","modeling of infectious diseases","complex modeling frameworks","case of future Zika epidemic preparation","preparation of complicated modeling frameworks","study of vector","names of vector","publication survey","network","compartmental structures","metapopulation","SURVEY METHODOLOGY","search terms","availability of large-scale real-world data","data-driven approaches","infectious disease spreads","basic model architectures","timely assessment of epidemics","identified types of model","greatest public health threat","review article","early epidemics","relevant studies","timely fashion","search criteria","year of publication","research articles","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","disease importation risk","steps of journal article","related transmission dynamics","newborn infants","real world","malaria","microcephaly","dengue","chikungunya","Google Scholar","computational power","West Nile","Yap Island","estimation","PHEIC","outbreaks","contrast","major outbreak","Teratogenic effects","Micronesia","PubMed databases","trends","effectiveness of intervention strategies","possible impacts","recent ones","RESULTS","agent","DISCUSSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6\u201330%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load \u003C1 \u00D7 10(6) copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by \u003E5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area.

System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as \u201Cwhat-if\u201D tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions \u2013 for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak\u2014some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community\u0027s local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tie empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios. These skills and insights would improve public health practice and be of particular use in the promotion of injury and disease prevention programs and practices.","publish_time":"2005-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoard, Marna; Homer, Jack; Manley, William; Furbee, Paul; Haque, Arshadul; Helmkamp, James","journal":"Int J Hyg Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d8552ea8d94977e2a7968a9e7e8ba178f3d44fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185526.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463905000155; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463905000155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["System Dynamics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["issues of disaster","hospital disaster preparedness issues","Disaster planners","rural disaster preparedness","disaster preparedness planners","System Dynamics approach","hospital coordination","evidence-based approach","rigorous systems approach","broad spectrum of disaster scenarios","wide variety of issues","System Dynamics analysis","computer simulation models","issue of hospital surge capacity","study","wide variety of scenarios","agencies","public health resources","well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology","public health practice","community\u0027s local emergency planning committee","best practices","particular use","coordination of medical care","complex social systems","disease prevention programs","types of service capacity","severe infectious disease outbreak","sustaining employee competence","promotion of injury","turnover","supplementary nursing staff","healthcare","wider community","insights","responses","decades","communication","example","mass casualties","conceptual framework","principles","delivery","skills","hospitals","tools","preliminary conclusions","empirical data","decision-making","question","mitigation","objective","interactions"],"language":"en"},

Several technologies have been designed to improve cellular uptake of therapeutic molecules, including cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). CPPs were first discovered based on the potency of several proteins to enter cells. Numerous CPPs have been described so far, which can be grouped into two major classes, the first requiring chemical linkage with the drug for cellular internalization and the second involving formation of stable, non-covalent complexes with drugs. Nowadays, CPPs constitute very promising tools for non-invasive cellular import of cargo and have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo delivery of therapeutic molecules varying from small chemical molecule, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, liposomes and particles. This review will focus on the structure/function and cellular uptake mechanism of CPPs in the general context of drug delivery. We will also highlight the application of peptide carriers for the delivery of therapeutic molecules and provide an update of their clinical evaluation.

It is generally accepted that autoantibodies against aquaporin 4 water channel protein play a pathogenic role in neuromyelitis optica. We have recently reported that plasmablasts are increased in the peripheral blood of this autoimmune disease, and are capable of producing autoantibodies against aquaporin 4. Here, we demonstrate that CD138(\u002B)HLA-DR(\u002B) plasmablasts, a subset of IgG-producing cells, are increased in the peripheral blood and are enriched among the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytes during the relapse of neuromyelitis optica. Notably, these CD138(\u002B)HLA-DR(\u002B) plasmablasts overexpress CXCR3, whose ligands are present in the cerebrospinal fluid during the relapse of neuromyelitis optica. These results led us to speculate that plasmablasts producing anti-aquaporin 4 autoantibodies might traffic toward the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, we performed single-cell sorting of plasmablasts from peripheral blood and CSF samples from NMO and sequenced the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the IgG heavy chain expressed by the sorted plasmablast clones. There were high frequencies of mutations in the CDRs compared with framework regions, indicating that these plasmablast clones would represent a post-germinal center B-cell lineage. Consistent with the preceding results, the plasmablast clones from the peripheral blood shared the same CDR sequences with the clones from the CSF. These results indicate that IgG-producing plasmablasts, which are guided by helper T-cells, may migrate from the peripheral blood preferentially to the CSF. Since migratory plasmablasts could be involved in the inflammatory pathology of NMO, the B-cell subset and their migration might be an attractive therapeutic target.","publish_time":"2013-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chihara, Norio; Aranami, Toshimasa; Oki, Shinji; Matsuoka, Takako; Nakamura, Masakazu; Kishida, Hitaru; Yokoyama, Kazumasa; Kuroiwa, Yoshiyuki; Hattori, Nobutaka; Okamoto, Tomoko; Murata, Miho; Toda, Tatsushi; Miyake, Sachiko; Yamamura, Takashi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9e7f41215542f62723e5118535f51d7d0c5cdab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3858367.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24340077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Neuromyelitis"],"organizations":["CSF","NMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peripheral blood","migratory plasmablasts","clones","relapse of neuromyelitis optica","single-cell sorting of plasmablasts","autoantibodies","CSF samples","subset of IgG","B-cell subset","CDRs","inflammatory disease","cerebrospinal fluid","inflammatory pathology of NMO","HLA-DR","anti-aquaporin","preceding results","CD138","IgG heavy chain","post-germinal center B-cell lineage","autoimmune disease","framework regions","helper T-cells","water channel protein","migration","pathogenic role","lymphocytes","recurrent attacks of optic neuritis","ligands","CDR sequences","CXCR3","complementarity","central nervous system","high frequencies of mutations","CNS","attractive therapeutic target"],"language":"en"},

Up\u2010regulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were observed during the heart development of Sprague\u2013Dawley rat and the differentiation of H9C2 cells. Moreover, interferon\u2010\u03B1 and \u2010\u03B2 induce the expression of IFITM3 while interferon\u2010\u03B3 up\u2010regulates IFITM1. Finally, interferon\u2010\u03B1 and \u2010\u03B2 were demonstrated to inhibit DNA synthesis during H9C2 cell differentiation. Our results indicated interferons are potentially involved in the differentiation and cell proliferation during heart development. J. Cell.

In response to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, Taipei City Government officials developed a School-based Infectious Disease Syndromic Surveillance System (SID-SSS). Teachers and nurses from preschools to universities in all 12 districts within Taipei are required to daily report cases of symptomatic children or sick leave requests through the SID-SSS. The pre-diagnosis at schools is submitted firstly as common pediatric disease syndrome-groups and re-submitted after confirmation by physicians. We retrieved these data from January 2010 to August 2011 for spatio-temporal analysis and evaluated the temporal trends with cases obtained from both the Emergency Department-based Syndromic Surveillance System (ED-SSS) and the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005). Through the SID-SSS, enterovirus-like illness (EVI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were the two most reported syndrome groups (77.6% and 15.8% among a total of 19,334 cases, respectively). The pre-diagnosis judgments made by school teachers and nurses showed high consistency with physicians\u2019 clinical diagnoses for EVI (97.8%) and ILI (98.9%). Most importantly, the SID-SSS had better timeliness with earlier peaks of EVI and ILI than those in the ED-SSS. Furthermore, both of the syndrome groups in these two surveillance systems had the best correlation reaching 0.98 and 0.95, respectively (p\u003C0.01). Spatio-temporal analysis observed the patterns of EVI and ILI both diffuse from the northern suburban districts to central Taipei, with ILI spreading faster. This novel system can identify early suspected cases of two important pediatric infections occurring at schools, and clusters from schools/families. It was also cost-effective (95.5% of the operation cost reduced and 59.7% processing time saved). The timely surveillance of mild EVI and ILI cases integrated with spatial analysis may help public health decision-makers with where to target for enhancing surveillance and prevention measures to minimize severe cases.","publish_time":"2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weng, Ting Chia; Chan, Ta Chien; Lin, Hsien Tang; Chang, Chia Kun Jasper; Wang, Wen Wen; Li, Zheng Rong Tiger; Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Chu, Yu-Roo; Chiu, Allen Wen-Hsiang; Yen, Muh-Yong; King, Chwan-Chuen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad00ba859cb901a728e33191c4795084743cb986.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4398411.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVI","ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ILI cases","SID-SSS","suspected cases","cluster cases","severe cases","ED-SSS","surveillance systems","timely surveillance of mild EVI","patterns of EVI","spatio-temporal analysis","Infectious Disease Syndromic Surveillance System","School children","school teachers","daily report cases of symptomatic children","earlier peaks of EVI","reported syndrome groups","common pediatric disease syndrome-groups","central Taipei","spatial analysis","nurses","novel system","temporal trends","influenza","illness","families","pre-diagnosis judgments","Taipei City Government officials","important pediatric infections","northern suburban districts","Longitudinal Health Insurance Database","public health decision-makers","high consistency","sick leave requests","pandemic","better timeliness","physicians\u2019 clinical diagnoses","H1N1","universities","pathogens","Emergency Department","LHID2005","preschools","campuses","clusters","prevention measures","enterovirus","operation cost","confirmation","best correlation","processing time","response","total"],"language":"en"},

As charcoal burning suicide victims have a unique sociodemographic profile (i.e., predominantly economically active men), they may commit suicide at specific times. However, little is known about the temporal patterns of charcoal burning suicides. METHODS: Suicide data from 2001 to 2008 on victims of usual working age (20\u201359) were obtained from the registered death files of the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong. A total of 1649 cases of charcoal burning suicide were analyzed using a two-step procedure, which first examined the temporal asymmetries in the incidence of suicide, and second investigated whether these asymmetries were influenced by sex and/or economic activity status. Poisson regression analyses were employed to model the monthly and daily patterns of suicide by economic activity status and sex. RESULTS: Our findings revealed pronounced monthly and daily temporal variations in the pattern of charcoal burning suicides in Hong Kong. Consistent with previous findings on overall suicide deaths, there was an overall spring peak in April, and Monday was the common high risk day for all groups. Although sex determined the pattern of variation in charcoal burning suicides, the magnitude of the variation was influenced by the economic activity status of the victims. CONCLUSION: The traditional classification of suicide methods as either violent or nonviolent tends to elide the temporal variations of specific methods. The interaction between sex and economic activity status observed in the present study indicates that sex should be taken into consideration when investigating the influence of economic activity status on temporal variations of suicide. This finding also suggests that suicide prevention efforts should be both time- and subgroup-specific.","publish_time":"2012-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Law, Chi-kin; Leung, Candi MC","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a28353cd5af668e408edfbc98b21224f3b04c232.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3443008.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22770504/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-505","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Census and Statistics Department"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["suicide victims","common suicide","temporal variations of suicide","Suicide data","incidence of suicide","daily patterns of suicide","overall suicide deaths","sex","temporal patterns of charcoal","suicide prevention efforts","influence of economic activity status","traditional classification of suicide methods","pattern of charcoal","temporal variations of specific methods","temporal asymmetries","cases of charcoal","daily temporal variations","suicides","pattern of variation","Statistics Department of Hong Kong","subgroup-specific","specific times","previous findings","victims of usual working age","overall spring peak","common high risk day","Census","unique sociodemographic profile","present study","registered death files","groups","interaction","CONCLUSION","consideration","magnitude","sealed room","Poisson regression analyses","two-step procedure","active men","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","total","year"],"language":"en"},

Diagnostic uncertainty over respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care contributes to over-prescribing of antibiotics and drives antibiotic resistance. If symptoms and signs predict respiratory tract microbiology, they could help clinicians target antibiotics to bacterial infection. This study aimed to determine relationships between symptoms and signs in children presenting to primary care and microbes from throat swabs. METHODS. Cross-sectional study of children \u22653 months to \u003C16 years presenting with acute cough and RTI, with subset follow-up. Associations and area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) statistics sought between clinical presentation and baseline microbe detection. Microbe prevalence compared between baseline (symptomatic) and follow-up (asymptomatic) visits. RESULTS. At baseline, \u22651 bacteria was detected in 1257/2113 (59.5%) children and \u22651 virus in 894/2127 (42%) children. Clinical presentation was not associated with detection of \u22651 bacteria [AUROC 0.54 (95% CI 0.52\u20130.56)] or \u22651 virus [0.64 (95% CI 0.61\u20130.66)]. Individually, only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with clinical presentation [AUROC 0.80 (0.77\u20130.84)]. Prevalence fell between baseline and follow-up; more so in viruses (68% versus 26%, P \u003C 0.001) than bacteria (56% versus 40%, P = 0.01); greatest reductions seen in RSV, influenza B and Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSION. Findings demonstrate that clinical presentation cannot distinguish the presence of bacteria or viruses in the upper respiratory tract. However, individual and overall microbe prevalence was greater when children were unwell than when well, providing some evidence that upper respiratory tract microbes may be the cause or consequence of the illness.

Decontamination of PPE could be useful to maintain adequate supplies, but there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of decontamination technologies. METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70\u00B0C for 30 minutes. We assessed the decontamination of 3 commercial N95 respirators inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2 and Phi6; the latter is an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses. Three and 6 log(10) reductions on respirators were considered effective for decontamination and disinfection, respectively. RESULTS: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s. The high-level disinfection cabinet was effective for decontamination of the N95s and achieved disinfection with an extended 31-minute cycle. Dry heat at 70\u00B0C for 30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages. CONCLUSIONS: UV-C could be useful to reduce contamination on N95 respirators. However, the UV-C technologies studied did not meet pre-established criteria for decontamination under the test conditions used. The high-level disinfection cabinet was more effective and met criteria for disinfection with an extended cycle.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cadnum, Jennifer L.; Li, Daniel F.; Redmond, Sarah N.; John, Amrita R.; Pearlmutter, Basya; Donskey, Curtis J.","journal":"Pathog Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b86424c0a898dc3d4f0d88d0aaebe7a431fb4d17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363254/; https://doi.org/10.20411/pai.v5i1.372","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Decontamination of PPE","UV-C technologies","UV-C box","ultraviolet-C","high-level disinfection cabinet","efficacy of decontamination technologies","room decontamination device","minute cycle","extended cycle","commercial N95 respirators","pre-established criteria","dry heat","N95s","METHODS","minutes","test conditions","bacteriophages MS2","Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method","Testing","MRSA","aerosolized peracetic acid","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","American Society","hydrogen peroxide","Shortages of personal protective equipment","ASTM E","light","uncertainty","urgent concern","surrogate","setting","BACKGROUND","Phi6","modification","enveloped RNA virus","global COVID","adequate supplies","sites","reductions","pandemic","coronaviruses","effectiveness","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We used mixed-effects regression models to explore the influence of genetic pedigree (% CB) on pairing success, growth, and survival during the 10-year captive breeding program at Washington State University, which included controlled pairings and outbreeding with pygmy rabbits from Idaho. Pairing success, juvenile growth, and juvenile survival declined with increasing CB pedigree of 1 or both parents, suggesting inbreeding depression among the small number of related founders.

A Swedish isolate of PCV2 (S-PCV2) retrieved in 1993 from a healthy pig has been used in this model to reproduce PMWS in pigs from Northern Ireland. This virus has been present in the Swedish pig population for at least a decade without causing any known PMWS disease problems, despite its potential pathogenicity. The reasons for this are unknown, but could be related to genetics, absence of triggers for PCV2 upregulation (infectious agent and/or management forms) within Swedish pig husbandry. In order to confirm the pathogenicity of S-PCV2, Swedish and Danish pigs were experimentally infected with this isolate according to the established model. Swedish pigs were also infected with a reference isolate of PCV2 (PCV2-1010) to compare the severity of disease caused by the two isolates in Swedish pigs. Both Danish and Swedish pigs developed PMWS after the experimental infection with S-PCV2. Antibodies to PCV2 developed later and reached lower levels in serum from pigs infected with S-PCV2 than in pigs inoculated with PCV2-1010. In general, pigs infected with S-PCV2 showed more severe clinical signs of disease than pigs infected with PCV2-1010, but pigs from all PCV2-inoculated groups displayed gross and histological lesions consistent with PMWS.

Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided into basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes. Despite a fitness cost of most mutations required to overcome a selective constraint, viruses can find evolutionary pathways that ensure their survival in equilibrium with their hosts.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virus as Populations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b1d36c395d04f82448c7f14bce6085b88bb2f47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153317.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128163313000040; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128163313000040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host range","different host species","life cycle of viruses","adaptive potential of viruses","host immune response","Abstract Viral population numbers","cell-dependent","Population bottlenecks","important contribution of population numbers","organism-dependent constraints","viral populations","types of constraints","modifications of cell tropism","capacity","evolutionary pathways","components","selective constraint","genome variation","mutations","survival","number of molecular mechanisms","phenotypic changes","equilibrium","fitness cost","hosts","individuals"],"language":"en"},

Nowadays, the virus-like particles (VLPs) based on L1 proteins have been considered as the best candidate for vaccine development against HPV infections. Two commercial HPV (Gardasil and Cervarix) are available. These HPV VLP vaccines induce genotype-limited protection. The major impediments such as economic barriers especially gaps in financing obstructed the optimal delivery of vaccines in developing countries. Thus, many efforts are underway to develop the next generation of vaccines against other types of high-risk HPV. In this study, we developed DNA constructs (based on L1 and L2 genes) that were potentially immunogenic and highly conserved among the high-risk HPV types. The framework of analysis include (1) B-cell epitope mapping, (2) T-cell epitope mapping (i.e., CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells), (3) allergenicity assessment, (4) tap transport and proteasomal cleavage, (5) population coverage, (6) global and template-based docking, and (7) data collection, analysis, and design of the L1 and L2 DNA constructs. Our data indicated the 8-epitope candidates for helper T-cell and CTL in L1 and L2 sequences. For the L1 and L2 constructs, combination of these peptides in a single universal vaccine could involve all world population by the rate of 95.55% and 96.33%, respectively. In vitro studies showed high expression rates of multiepitope L1 (~57.86%) and L2 (~68.42%) DNA constructs in HEK-293T cells. Moreover, in vivo studies indicated that the combination of L1 and L2 DNA constructs without any adjuvant or delivery system induced effective immune responses, and protected mice against C3 tumor cells (the percentage of tumor-free mice: ~66.67%). Thus, the designed L1 and L2 DNA constructs would represent promising applications for HPV vaccine development.","publish_time":"2019-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Namvar, Ali; Bolhassani, Azam; Javadi, Gholamreza; Noormohammadi, Zahra","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50c268968326f133eeacd3745e43a4226d867ce8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6811573.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645650/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51679-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV","HPV VLP","CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["L2 constructs","L2 DNA constructs","combination of L1","designed L1","L1 proteins","HPV vaccine development","HPV infections","L2 genes","L2 sequences","commercial HPV","HPV VLP vaccines","types of high-risk HPV","high-risk HPV types","T cells","T-cell epitope mapping","helper T-cell","high expression rates of multiepitope L1","B-cell epitope mapping","optimal delivery of vaccines","world population","C3 tumor cells","epitope candidates","generation of vaccines","studies","single universal vaccine","template-based docking","delivery system","protected mice","percentage of tumor","free mice","population coverage","data collection","framework of analysis","effective immune responses","adjuvant","promising applications","gaps","financing","peptides","CTL","economic barriers","best candidate","genotype-limited protection","main cause of cervical cancer","Gardasil","Cervarix","VLPs","developing countries","CD4","HEK","major impediments","proteasomal cleavage","transmitted infection","transport","particles","CD8","allergenicity assessment","Human papillomavirus","study","efforts"],"language":"en"},

The diversity of bat trypanosomes globally is still poorly understood, and the common ancestor, geographical origin, and evolution of species within the T. cruzi clade remain largely unresolved. METHODS: Trypanosome sequences were obtained from cultured parasites and from museum archived liver/blood samples of bats captured from Guatemala (Central America) to the Brazilian Atlantic Coast. Phylogenies were inferred using Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH), and Spliced Leader (SL) RNA genes. RESULTS: Here, we described Trypanosoma wauwau n. sp. from Pteronotus bats (Mormoopidae) placed in the T. cruzi clade, then supporting the bat-seeding hypothesis whereby the common ancestor of this clade likely was a bat trypanosome. T. wauwau was sister to the clade T. spp-Neobats from phyllostomid bats forming an assemblage of trypanosome species exclusively of Noctilionoidea Neotropical bats, which was sister to an Australian clade of trypanosomes from indigenous marsupials and rodents, which possibly evolved from a bat trypanosome. T. wauwau was found in 26.5 % of the Pteronotus bats examined, and phylogeographical analysis evidenced the wide geographical range of this species. To date, this species was not detected in other bats, including those that were sympatric or shared shelters with Pteronotus. T. wauwau did not develop within mammalian cells, and was not infective to Balb/c mice or to triatomine vectors of T. cruzi and T. rangeli. CONCLUSIONS: Trypanosoma wauwau n. sp. was linked to Pteronotus bats. The positioning of the clade T. wauwau/T.spp-Neobats as the most basal Neotropical bat trypanosomes and closely related to an Australian lineage of trypanosomes provides additional evidence that the T. cruzi clade trypanosomes likely evolved from bats, and were dispersed in bats within and between continents from ancient to unexpectedly recent times.

The seroprevalence of RVF was investigated among the human population in Borno State, Nigeria to determine the occurrence of the disease in the study area in comparison with that of Lassa fever and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever. METHODS: Recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP)-based IgG-ELISAs for the detection of serum antibodies against RVF virus (RVFV), Lassa fever virus (LASV), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) were used to test human sera in Borno State, Nigeria. The presence of neutralizing antibody against the RVFV-glycoprotein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype (RVFVpv) was also determined in the human sera. RESULTS: Of the 297 serum samples tested, 42 (14.1%) were positive for the presence of RVFV-IgG and 22 (7.4%) and 7 (2.4%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies against LASV and CCHFV, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the titers of neutralizing antibodies obtained using RVFVpv and those obtained using the conventional neutralization assay with the attenuated RVFV-MP12 strain. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of RVF was significantly higher than that of LASV and CCHF in Borno State, Nigeria. The RVFVpv-based neutralization assay developed in this study has the potential to replace the traditional assays based on live viruses for the diagnosis and seroepidemiological studies of RVF.","publish_time":"2014-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bukbuk, David Nadeba; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Tani, Hideki; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Taniguchi, Satoshi; Iha, Koichiro; Fukuma, Aiko; Shimojima, Masayuki; Morikawa, Shigeru; Saijo, Masayuki; Kasolo, Francis; Baba, Saka Saheed","journal":"Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eda4b00244cb209f8e7d16463c8f6270f26d398c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107251.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/tru163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25344695/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVF","Borno State","LASV"],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["RVF virus","Lassa fever virus","seroprevalence of RVF","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus","presence of RVFV","LASV","Borno State","Nigeria","RVFV-glycoprotein","RVFVpv-based neutralization assay","serum samples","human sera","Rift Valley fever","detection of serum antibodies","seroepidemiological studies of RVF","titers of neutralizing antibodies","human population","based IgG-ELISAs","CCHFV","positive correlation","vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype","attenuated RVFV-MP12 strain","conventional neutralization assay","presence of neutralizing antibody","study area","rNP","live viruses","tropical regions of eastern","diagnosis","comparison","Recombinant nucleoprotein","traditional assays","southern Africa","disease","occurrence","BACKGROUND","METHODS","potential","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We found that two RNA viruses with broad host ranges, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SINV), are completely restricted in their replication after entry into Lepidopteran cells. This restriction is overcome when cells are co-infected with vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate DNA virus. Using RNAi screening, we show that Lepidopteran RNAi, Nuclear Factor-\u03BAB, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways restrict RNA virus infection. Surprisingly, a highly conserved, uncharacterized VACV protein, A51R, can partially overcome this virus restriction. We show that A51R is also critical for VACV replication in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice. Interestingly, A51R colocalizes with, and stabilizes, host microtubules and also associates with ubiquitin. We show that A51R promotes viral protein stability, possibly by preventing ubiquitin-dependent targeting of viral proteins for destruction. Importantly, our studies reveal exciting new opportunities to study virus-host interactions in experimentally-tractable Lepidopteran systems.

The glutathione S-conjugate is sequentially converted to the cysteinylglycine-, cysteine- and N-acetyl-cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate). The mercapturate is generally more polar and water soluble than the parent electrophile and is readily excreted. Excretion of the mercapturate represents a detoxication mechanism. Some endogenous compounds, such as leukotrienes, prostaglandin (PG) A2, 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-PGJ2, and hydroxynonenal can also be metabolized to mercapturates and excreted. On occasion, however, formation of glutathione S- and cysteine S-conjugates are bioactivation events as the metabolites are mutagenic and/or cytotoxic. When the cysteine S-conjugate contains a strong electron-withdrawing group attached at the sulfur, it may be converted by cysteine S-conjugate \u03B2-lyases to pyruvate, ammonium and the original electrophile modified to contain an \u2013SH group. If this modified electrophile is highly reactive then the enzymes of the mercapturate pathway together with the cysteine S-conjugate \u03B2-lyases constitute a bioactivation pathway. Some endogenous halogenated environmental contaminants and drugs are bioactivated by this mechanism. Recent studies suggest that coupling of enzymes of the mercapturate pathway to cysteine S-conjugate \u03B2-lyases may be more common in nature and more widespread in the metabolism of electrophilic xenobiotics than previously realized.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, A.J.L.; Hanigan, M.

Abstract Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Environmental and infectious factors had been strongly associated and involved in the increased occurrence of MS, to more than twice, in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the main findings on the relationship between viral and bacterial infections and the onset and progression of MS. Methods The research involved a systematic review of scientific literature regarding infection and MS. Our search was performed using and consulting specialized websites like PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. The keywords (MeSH terms) employed for the digital search were: \u201Cvirus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, and multiple sclerosis.\u201D Articles published in English indexed journals during the past 15 years were used for the study. Results Epidemiological studies suggest that MS has an infectious etiologic component causing an inflammatory process that may contribute to the initiation and/or exacerbation of the disease. Particularly, viral infections and demyelination events in the CNS may be due to the penetration of viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) through the bloodstream to the CNS, specifically. On the other hand, chronic bacterial infections may cause demyelination processes that trigger or increase the complications of the disease in MS. Conclusions This study shows the multiple factors involved in the occurrence of MS. More epidemiological studies are necessary to support the relationship and involvement of viral and bacterial infections in the onset, development and severity of the disease.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berm\u00FAdez-Morales, Victor Hugo; Castrejon-Salgado, Ricardo; Torres-Poveda, Kirvis; de Jes\u00FAs Flores-Rivera, Jos\u00E9; Flores-Aldana, Mario; Madrid-Marina, Vicente; Hern\u00E1ndez-Gir\u00F3n, Carlos","journal":"Neurolog\u00EDa Argentina","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S185300281630088X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S185300281630088X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M\u00E9todos","Resultados Estudios"],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relaci\u00F3n y","desmielinizaci\u00F3n en","infecci\u00F3n y EM","en los \u00FAltimos","desarrollo y","agentes virales y bacterianos en","Medline y Cochrane","infecci\u00F3n viral y los eventos","En este art\u00EDculo","multicausalidad implicada en","aparici\u00F3n y progresi\u00F3n","viral infections","enfermedad","autoimmune disease","principalmente publicados en ingl\u00E9s","EM tiene","virus como","SNC que agravan","Se eligieron art\u00EDculos publicados en revistas indexadas durante los \u00FAltimos","virus Epstein-Barr","Epstein-Barr virus","common inflammatory disease","multiple factors","CNS","relaci\u00F3n entre ciertas infecciones virales y bacterianas","discapacidad neurol\u00F3gica en adultos j\u00F3venes","A\u00FAn falta desarrollar m\u00E1s estudios epidemiol\u00F3gicos que demuestren y comprueben","central nervous system","chronic bacterial infections","involvement of viral","SNC puede deberse","M\u00E9todos Se realiz\u00F3","Abstract Introduction Multiple sclerosis","proceso inflamatorio que puede contribuir","Resultados Estudios epidemiol\u00F3gicos sugieren que","b\u00FAsqueda se utilizaron como palabras claves","revisi\u00F3n se describen los principales hallazgos reportados sobre","art\u00EDculos cient\u00EDficos relacionados","hasta m\u00E1s","ocurrencia","Pubmed","relationship","onset","EBV","a\u00F1os","infectious factors","increased occurrence of MS","Epidemiological studies","study","years","componente etiol\u00F3gico infeccioso que origina","trastorno inflamatorio m\u00E1s com\u00FAn","aportar evidencia cient\u00EDfica donde se demuestra","t\u00E9rminos MeSH","inflammatory process","MeSH terms","demyelination processes","demyelination events","digital search","Los factores ambientales e infecciosos han sido fuertemente asociados","infecciones bacterianas cr\u00F3nicas pueden causar procesos","sistema nervioso central","infectious etiologic component","Conclusiones Este estudio contribuye","systematic review of scientific literature","leading cause of neurological disability","implicaci\u00F3n","causa principal","origen","plataformas virtuales","plan metodol\u00F3gico","incremento","mediante","doble","trav\u00E9s","iniciaci\u00F3n o exacerbaci\u00F3n","penetraci\u00F3n","esclerosis m\u00FAltiple","torrente sangu\u00EDneo","research","espec\u00EDficamente hacia","Methods","Por otro lado","progression of","Para","Conclusions","development","English indexed journals","young adults","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","specialized websites","main findings","severidad","Particularmente","Articles","penetration of viruses","complications","severity","hand","bloodstream","initiation","keywords","exacerbation"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we argue that mammalogists are uniquely placed to contribute to addressing these challenges because in-depth knowledge of mammal species is fundamental to the development of wild model systems that could accelerate discovery in disease ecology. The use of animal models\u2014species for which a broad range of diagnostic, molecular, and genetic tools have been developed\u2014in tightly controlled laboratory environments has been instrumental in driving progress in the biomedical sciences. However, in natural populations, disease processes operate in the context of enormous genetic, phenotypic, and environmental variability. Understanding diseases in animal populations (including humans) thus requires investment in \u201Cwild animal models\u201D that explicitly include individual variation and relevant environmental gradients. Wild mammal groups such as primates and rodents have already been identified as potentially useful models of infectious diseases in the wild. Here, we discuss the enormous potential that ungulates hold as candidates for wild model systems. The diversity, broad geographic distribution, and often high abundance of species in this group make them a highly accessible target for disease research. Moreover, a depth of background knowledge, close relationships to domesticated animals, and ongoing management of many wild ungulate species provide context, tools, and opportunity for cutting-edge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences. Studies of wild ungulates are already helping to unravel some key challenges in infectious disease research, including the role of parasites in trophic cascades, the consequences of climate change for disease dynamics, and the systems biology of host\u2013parasite interactions. Other areas where ungulate studies may provide new insight include research on the sources and drivers of emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jolles, Anna E.; Ezenwa, Vanessa O.","journal":"J Mammal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/265550669ed69c2cf7a7a76fe0a3bad644dbb8a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107476.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyu007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious disease research","disease processes","disease ecology","wild ungulate species","wild animal models","disease dynamics","Studies of wild ungulates","animal populations","Wild mammal groups","development of wild model systems","natural populations","useful models of infectious diseases","cutting-edge research","face of increased rates of infectious disease emergence","use of animal models","in-depth knowledge of mammal species","drivers of emerging infectious diseases","high abundance of species","genetic tools","context of enormous genetic","evolution of mammalian populations","ungulate studies","biomedical sciences","fundamental driving force","systems biology of host","driving progress","role of parasites","key challenges","environmental variability","enormous potential","broad geographic distribution","depth of background knowledge","broad range of diagnostic","relevant environmental gradients","sources","consequences of climate change","urgent priority","candidates","close relationships","trophic cascades","individual variation","interface of ecological","new insight","ongoing management","animals","opportunity","discovery","controlled laboratory environments","parasite interactions","pathogens","primates","accessible target","humans","investment","diversity","rodents","areas","review","mammalogists"],"language":"en"},

The original CPV\u20102 was replaced by three antigenic variants, CPV\u20102a, CPV\u20102b and CPV\u20102c, which to date have gained a worldwide distribution with different relative proportions. All previous studies conducted in Africa were based on partial VP2 gene sequences. The aim of this study was to provide a genome analysis to characterize the CPV strains collected in Nigeria, Africa. Rectal swab samples (n = 320) were collected in 2018 and tested by means of an immunochromatographic assay. Among the 144 positive samples, 59 were selected for further analyses using different molecular assays. The results revealed a high prevalence of CPV\u20102c (91.5%) compared to the CPV\u20102a variant (8.5%). The VP2 gene sequences showed a divergence from the strains analysed in 2010 in Nigeria and a closer connection with CPV strains of Asian origin.

The molecular analysis based on genomic sequences evidenced a geographical pattern of distribution of the analysed strains, suggesting a potential common evolutionary origin with CPV of Asian origin.

We hypothesised that oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate and azithromycin would each be superior to placebo in achieving symptom resolution of non-severe exacerbations in children by day 14 of treatment. METHODS: In this multicentre, three-arm, parallel, double-dummy, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial at four paediatric centres in Australia and New Zealand, we enrolled children aged 1\u201318 years with CT-confirmed bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis, who were under the care of a respiratory physician and who had had at least two respiratory exacerbations in the 18 months before study entry. Participants were allocated (1:1:1) at exacerbation onset to receive oral suspensions of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate (45 mg/kg per day) plus placebo azithromycin, azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) plus placebo amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, or both placebos for 14 days. An independent statistician prepared a computer-generated, permuted-block (size 2\u20138) randomisation sequence, stratified by centre, age, and cause. Participants, caregivers, study coordinators, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment until data analysis was completed. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with exacerbation resolution by day 14 in the intention-to-treat population. Treatment groups were compared using generalised linear models. Statistical significance was set at p\u003C0\u00B70245 to account for multiple comparisons. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000011886) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between April 17, 2012, and March 1, 2017, 604 children were screened and 252 were enrolled. Between July 31, 2012, and June 26, 2017, 197 children were allocated at the start of an exacerbation (63 to the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate group, 67 to the azithromycin group, and 67 to the placebo group). Respiratory viruses were identified in 82 (53%) of 154 children with available nasal swabs on day 1 of treatment. Primary outcome data were available for 196 (99%) children (one child with missing data [placebo group] was recorded as non-resolved according to criteria defined a priori). By day 14, exacerbations had resolved in 41 (65%) children in the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate group, 41 (61%) in the azithromycin group, and 29 (43%) in the placebo group. Compared with placebo, relative risk for resolution by day 14 was 1\u00B750 (95% CI 1\u00B708\u20132\u00B709, p=0\u00B7015; number-needed-to-treat [NNT] 5 [95% CI 3\u201320]) in the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate group and 1\u00B741 (1\u00B701\u20131\u00B797, p=0\u00B7042; NNT 6 [3\u201379]) in the azithromycin group. Adverse events were recorded in 19 (30%) children in the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate group, 20 (30%) in the azithromycin group, and 14 (21%) in the placebo group, but no events were severe or life-threatening. INTERPRETATION: Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate treatment is beneficial in terms of resolution of non-severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children, and should remain the first-line oral antibiotic in this setting.

However, there has been no recent comprehensive review of this emerging field. This paper summarises how mathematical models have informed the field of HCAI and how methods have developed over time. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL plus and Global Health databases were systematically searched for dynamic mathematical models of HCAI transmission and/or the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings. RESULTS: In total, 96 papers met the eligibility criteria. The main research themes considered were evaluation of infection control effectiveness (64%), variability in transmission routes (7%), the impact of movement patterns between healthcare institutes (5%), the development of antimicrobial resistance (3%), and strain competitiveness or co-colonisation with different strains (3%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly modelled HCAI (34%), followed by vancomycin resistant enterococci (16%). Other common HCAIs, e.g. Clostridum difficile, were rarely investigated (3%). Very few models have been published on HCAI from low or middle-income countries. The first HCAI model has looked at antimicrobial resistance in hospital settings using compartmental deterministic approaches. Stochastic models (which include the role of chance in the transmission process) are becoming increasingly common. Model calibration (inference of unknown parameters by fitting models to data) and sensitivity analysis are comparatively uncommon, occurring in 35% and 36% of studies respectively, but their application is increasing. Only 5% of models compared their predictions to external data. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission models have been used to understand complex systems and to predict the impact of control policies. Methods have generally improved, with an increased use of stochastic models, and more advanced methods for formal model fitting and sensitivity analyses.

Methods There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Deng-hai; Wu, Kun-lun; Zhang, Xue; Deng, Sheng-qiong; Peng, Bin","journal":"Journal of Integrative Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102521.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095496420300157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32113846/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095496420300157; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.02.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["nCoV compounds","selected compounds","natural compounds","Chinese herbs","viral respiratory infections","Chinese herbal databases","herbal plants","Chinese medical herbs","acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","viral infection","Conclusion Chinese herbal treatments","traditional Chinese medicines","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","network pharmacology analysis","nCoV activity","ongoing novel coronavirus","Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database","potential","nCoV protein interaction","classic herbal usage","docking analysis","rational screen","selected herb","inflammation reactions","evaluation","distribution","ADME","metabolism","excretion","listing","main steps","absorption","hypoxia response","study","catalogue","literature search","roles","oral administration","screening process","effects","requirements","pneumonia","Abstract Objective","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Previous virion proteomic studies have shown that enveloped viruses carry multiple host cellular proteins both internally and externally during their life cycle. To address whether it also occurred during NDV infection, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of highly purified NDV La Sota strain particles. RESULTS: In addition to five viral structural proteins, we detected thirty cellular proteins associated with purified NDV La Sota particles. The identified cellular proteins comprised several functional categories, including cytoskeleton proteins, annexins, molecular chaperones, chromatin modifying proteins, enzymes-binding proteins, calcium-binding proteins and signal transduction-associated proteins. Among these, three host proteins have not been previously reported in virions of other virus families, including two signal transduction-associated proteins (syntenin and Ras small GTPase) and one tumor-associated protein (tumor protein D52). The presence of five selected cellular proteins (i.e., \u03B2-actin, tubulin, annexin A2, heat shock protein Hsp90 and ezrin) associated with the purified NDV particles was validated by Western blot or immunogold labeling assays. CONCLUSIONS: The current study presented the first standard proteomic profile of NDV. The results demonstrated the incorporation of cellular proteins in NDV particles, which provides valuable information for elucidating viral infection and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2012-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Xiangpeng; Xue, Chunyi; Kong, Qingming; Zhang, Chengwen; Bi, Yingzuo; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Proteome Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9009370b71d913612356de26f968966c3399da2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3413529.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-10-32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22571704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV La Sota","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","cytoskeleton proteins","incorporation of cellular proteins","selected cellular proteins","identified cellular proteins","signal transduction-associated proteins","calcium-binding proteins","enzymes-binding proteins","viral structural proteins","multiple host cellular proteins","purified NDV particles","NDV infection","tumor-associated protein","standard proteomic profile of NDV","Sota particles","Sota strain particles","enveloped RNA virus","tumor protein D52","virus families","viral infection","RESULTS","comprehensive proteomic analysis","Newcastle disease virus","enveloped viruses","heat shock protein Hsp90","Previous virion proteomic studies","annexin A2","syntenin","severe economic losses","Western blot","molecular chaperones","functional categories","tubulin","annexins","chromatin","ezrin","Ras small GTPase","\u03B2-actin","valuable information","current study","immunogold labeling assays","poultry industry","BACKGROUND","addition","pathogenesis","presence","CONCLUSIONS","virions","life cycle"],"language":"en"},

In Queensland, the highest number of H1N1 cases were admitted to the intensive care unit when compared with the other Australian states. While many recent studies examining the H1N1 pandemic have focussed on service delivery and disease epidemiology, few have explored the lived experiences of frontline health care workers caring for the patients in the intensive care unit. Objectives The purposes of this study were to: document and describe the lived experiences of the nursing and medical staff caring for patients in the intensive care unit during the H1N1 pandemic; to validate the staffs\u2019 experiences; and to assist in informing future pandemic planning by highlighting the collective experiences of these frontline health care workers. Design A phenomenological study method was used. Setting and participants 34 staff from a tertiary referral hospital in Brisbane, Australia participated in the study. Methods Data was collected using an open ended questionnaire and focus groups. The resulting responses were analysed using Colaizzi\u0027s framework to discover regular patterns of meaning that emerged. Results Eight common themes emerged: the wearing of personal protective equipment; infection control procedures; the fear of contracting and transmitting the disease; adequate staffing levels within the intensive care unit; new roles for staff; morale levels; education regarding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and the challenges of patient care. These eight themes articulate the lived experience of the staff during the height of the H1N1 Influenza pandemic period. Conclusions Planning for a pandemic situation is invariably difficult due to the unpredictable nature of the event itself. Recommendations for future pandemic planning which can be drawn from this study include the appointment of a dedicated infection control representative to provide information and support regarding infection control matters; the maintenance of effective communication channels is crucial; and the increased staffing requirements across nursing, medical, allied health and ancillary staff to cope with the higher patient numbers and acuity must be anticipated and planned for.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corley, Amanda; Hammond, Naomi E.; Fraser, John F.","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a458136a0d4c1599904b812a0304ee5f70c0ae3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125717.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.11.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002074890900371X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036360/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002074890900371X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Methods Data","Colaizzi"],"locations":["Australia","Brisbane"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 pandemic","intensive care unit","pandemic situation","future pandemic planning","H1N1 Influenza pandemic period","medical staff","lived experiences of frontline health care workers","challenges of patient care","ancillary staff","collective experiences","staffs\u2019 experiences","infection control matters","infection control procedures","dedicated infection control representative","patients","nursing","allied health","highest number of H1N1 cases","Conclusions Planning","phenomenological study method","adequate staffing levels","morale levels","disease epidemiology","common themes","increased staffing requirements","higher patient numbers","information","new roles","wearing of personal protective equipment","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","education","support","maintenance of effective communication channels","height","tertiary referral hospital","Colaizzi\u0027s framework","Brisbane","appointment","service delivery","open ended questionnaire","fear","Abstract Background","unpredictable nature","groups","resulting responses","regular patterns","acuity","Queensland","participants","recent studies","Recommendations","document","Methods Data","event","Results","Objectives","purposes","Australian states"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, infection is often caused by a combination of viruses acting at the same time. The present study demonstrates, using multiplex RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR, that in the 2015/2016 influenza season, co-infections were confirmed in patients aged 1 month to 90 years. We found 73 co-infections involving influenza viruses, 17 involving influenza viruses and influenza-like viruses, and six involving influenza-like viruses. The first type of co-infections above mentioned was the most common, amounting to 51 cases, with type A and B viruses occurring simultaneously.

Many SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been detected in bats, particularly those that reside in China, Europe, and Africa. To further understand the evolutionary relationship between SARS-CoV and its reservoirs, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017. PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65% of bats belonging to this region, and this number was influenced by seasonal changes. Full genomic analyses of the two new SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and ZC45) showed that their genomes were 29,732 nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). These results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China. Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy. Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity of the SL-CoVs carried by bats and also provided a new perspective to study the possibility of cross-species transmission of SL-CoVs using suckling rats as an animal model.","publish_time":"2018-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Dan; Zhu, Changqiang; Ai, Lele; He, Ting; Wang, Yi; Ye, Fuqiang; Yang, Lu; Ding, Chenxi; Zhu, Xuhui; Lv, Ruicheng; Zhu, Jin; Hassan, Bachar; Feng, Youjun; Tan, Weilong; Wang, Changjun","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeaf5bd4725051f6926d06450566673d1cc4a639.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6135831.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30209269/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0155-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Europe","Africa","Zhejiang"],"keyphrases":["bats","new SL-CoVs","civet SARS CoVs","bat SL-CoVs","SARS-CoV","SARS coronavirus","China","large SARS outbreak","species transmission of SL","brains of suckling rats","coronaviruses","study","Zhoushan city","new perspective","shared nucleotide identity","human","conserved coronaviral protein RdRp","causative agent","possibility of cross","PCR amplification","genetic diversity","Zhejiang province","electron microscopy","ZC45","cause disease","ZXC21","open reading frames","animal model","number","ORFs","results","genomes","understanding","nucleotides","length","genomic analyses","evolutionary relationship","studies","reservoirs","seasonal changes","particles","Europe","Africa","region","pathogenic tests"],"language":"en"},

The foreign GFP gene was stable genetically after 10 rounds of passage in Vero cells. Importantly, MVTT2-GFP elicited both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the GFP gene in mice. With two intramuscular inoculations of 105 PFU virus, the anti-GFP antibody reciprocal endpoint titer reached over 700 as determined by an ELISA. The number of IFN-\u03B3 secreting T cells reached over 350SFU per million splenocytes against a CD8\u002B T cell-specific epitope of GFP. Collectively, the removal of the M1L-K2L genes is a useful method to generate an attenuated vaccinia Tian Tan vaccine vector.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Weijun; Fang, Qing; Zhuang, Ke; Wang, Haibo; Yu, Wenbo; Zhou, Jingying; Liu, Li; Tien, Po; Zhang, Linqi; Chen, Zhiwei","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b715b120180b24a6efb23ca38fb3bdea33ac3e40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112875.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340700105X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609340700105X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tian Tan"],"organizations":["VTT","GFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MVTT2-GFP","foreign GFP gene","T cell-specific epitope of GFP","parental VTT","modified VTT","anti-GFP antibody reciprocal endpoint titer","viral M1L-K2L genes","fold","human HeLa cell lines","mice","attenuated vaccinia Tian Tan vaccine vector","safe vaccinia Tian Tan","life cycle of viral replication","intranasal viral inoculation","based vaccine vector","replication capacity","\u03B3 secreting T cells","PFU virus","useful method","Vero cells","rabbit RK13","mouse body weight loss","CD8","immune responses","SFU","different stages","number of IFN","rounds of passage","intracranial LD50 value","splenocytes","electron microscope examination","intramuscular inoculations","removal","comparison","ELISA"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we explored the antiviral effect of CH25H and 25HC on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes high mortality rates in newborn piglets with severe diarrhea, and considerable financial loss in the swine industry worldwide. Our results showed that PEDV infection downregulated the expression of CH25H in Vero cells. An overexpression and knockdown assay indicated that CH25H has significant antiviral action against PEDV, and a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) that lacks hydroxylase activity also retains antiviral activity to a lesser extent. Furthermore, 25HC had a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against different PEDV strains by blocking viral entry. In addition, CH25H and 25HC inhibited the replication of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV).

The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of how RSV causes infection is based upon studies that have been carried out using traditional 2D methods, with cells cultured on flat plastic dishes. Although these simplified culture systems are essential to gain an insight into the fundamentals of host-pathogen interactions, cells in 2D are not exposed to the same conditions as cells in 3D tissues in the body and are therefore a poor representation of thein vivo microenvironment. In this study, we aim to develop the first 3D culture model for RSV infection using A549 cells to test its utility for RSV pathogenesis. METHODS: To generate spheroids, A549 cells were cultured using ultra-low attachment plates to generate 25 \u00D7 10(3) cell spheroids. The viability of the spheroids was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry showing prominent live cells throughout the spheroids confirming high viability over seven days of incubation. RESULTS: Immunostaining of A549 spheroids inoculated with RSV, showed time-dependent dissemination of the viral antigen RSV-F within the spheroid, resulting in syncytia formation and a 3-fold increase in mucin secretion compared to the uninfected cells. Additionally, RSV successfully replicated in the spheroids producing infectious virus as early as day one post-inoculation and was sustained for up to 7 days post-inoculation. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that A549 spheroids are susceptible and permissive for RSV since they exhibit the characteristics of RSV infection including syncytia formation and mucin overexpression, suggesting that A549 spheroids can be used a promising model for studying RSV in vitro.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saleh, Fatima; Harb, Aya; Soudani, Nadia; Zaraket, Hassan","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b5cf3dc9625fc50a355aa898a37ecaf1cdbb20d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190299.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120304123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360024/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120304123","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A549 cells","RSV pathogenesis","characteristics of RSV infection","Immunostaining of A549 spheroids","cell spheroids","prevention of RSV infections","uninfected cells","viral antigen RSV-F","prominent live cells","D methods","D culture model","D tissues","syncytia formation","RESULTS","days post-inoculation","mucin overexpression","mucin secretion","promising model","infectious virus","high viability","days of incubation","Respiratory syncytial virus","simplified culture systems","flow cytometry","trypan blue exclusion assay","time-dependent dissemination","young children","infants","mortality","pathogen interactions","fundamentals of host","fold increase","immune-compromised patients","primary cause of morbidity","ultra-low attachment plates","insight","body","vaccine","BACKGROUND","knowledge","poor representation of thein","utility","flat plastic dishes","microenvironment","conditions","CONCLUSIONS","overwhelming majority","studies","study"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we developed a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) system for a rapid and highly sensitive detection of enterovirus including PV to identify stool samples positive for enterovirus including PV. METHODS: A primer set was designed for RT-LAMP to detect enterovirus preferably those with PV-like 5\u0027NTRs of the viral genome. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP system was evaluated with prototype strains of enterovirus. Detection of enterovirus from stool extracts was examined by using RT-LAMP system. RESULTS: We detected at least 400 copies of the viral genomes of PV(Sabin) strains within 90 min by RT-LAMP with the primer set. This RT-LAMP system showed a preference for Human enterovirus species C (HEV-C) strains including PV, but exhibited less sensitivity to the prototype strains of HEV-A and HEV-B (detection limits of 7,400 to 28,000 copies). Stool extracts, from which PV, HEV-C, or HEV-A was isolated in the cell culture system, were mostly positive by RT-LAMP method (positive rates of 15/16 (= 94%), 13/14 (= 93%), and 4/4 (= 100%), respectively). The positive rate of this RT-LAMP system for stool extracts from which HEV-B was isolated was lower than that of HEV-C (positive rate of 11/21 (= 52%)). In the stool samples, which were negative for enterovirus isolation by the cell culture system, we found that two samples were positive for RT-LAMP (positive rates of 2/38 (= 5.3%)). In these samples, enterovirus 96 was identified by sequence analysis utilizing a seminested PCR system. CONCLUSIONS: RT-LAMP system developed in this study showed a high sensitivity comparable to that of the cell culture system for the detection of PV, HEV-A, and HEV-C, but less sensitivity to HEV-B. This RT-LAMP system would be useful for the direct detection of enterovirus from the stool extracts.","publish_time":"2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arita, Minetaro; Ling, Hua; Yan, Dongmei; Nishimura, Yorihiro; Yoshida, Hiromu; Wakita, Takaji; Shimizu, Hiroyuki","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f3fae76f66b8f351abbef071fdf7e6efc1c325c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2803793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015403/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP system","RT-LAMP method","HEV-C","sensitivity of RT","detection of PV","stool samples positive","HEV-B","cell culture system","stool extracts","prototype strains of HEV","direct detection of enterovirus","sensitive detection of enterovirus","enterovirus isolation","prototype strains of enterovirus","positive rates","seminested PCR system","Human enterovirus species C","viral genomes of PV","stool samples of acute flaccid paralysis","detection limits","high sensitivity comparable","study","primer set","copies","preference","laboratory diagnosis","critical role","isothermal amplification","global eradication program","poliomyelitis","AFP","isolating poliovirus","sequence analysis","reverse transcription-loop","cases","Sabin","BACKGROUND","NTRs","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 4148 hospitalized children with CAP were recruited from January to December 2017 at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Hebei Province, affiliated to Hebei Medical University. A variety of respiratory viruses, bacteria and Mp were detected using multiple modalities. The demographic and clinical features of CAP children with Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detection were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 110 CAP children with Mp positive, 42 (38.18%) of them were co-detected with at least one other pathogen. Co-detection was more common among children aged \u22643 years. No significant differences were found in most clinical symptoms, complications, underlying conditions and disease severity parameters among various etiological groups, with the following exceptions. First, prolonged duration of fever, lack of appetite and runny nose were more prevalent among CAP children with Mp-virus co-detection. Second, Mp-virus (excluding HRV) co-detected patients were more likely to present with prolonged duration of fever. Third, patients co-detected with Mp-bacteria were more likely to have abnormal blood gases. Additionally, CAP children with Mp-HRV co-detection were significantly more likely to report severe runny nose compared to those with Mp mono-detection. CONCLUSION: Mp co-detection with viral and/or bacterial pathogens is common in clinical practice.

To meet this challenge, investigators in this discipline will need to measure the global burden of critical illness and available critical-care resources, and develop both preventive and therapeutic interventions that are generalisable across countries.","publish_time":"2010-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adhikari, Neill KJ; Fowler, Robert A; Bhagwanjee, Satish; Rubenfeld, Gordon D","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db8ef4305cc9af4691ea97841ce28f5236b823e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7136988.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60446-1; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673610604461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20934212/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673610604461","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Critical care capacity","Expansion of critical care","available critical-care resources","inadequate primary care","intensive care unit","global burden of critical illness","ageing population","population ages","Population-based studies","ill patients","developed world","developing world","treatment of poliomyelitis victims","higher-risk medical therapies","natural disasters","respiratory failure","conflict","high costs","consequences","therapeutic interventions","location","time of economic constraint","specific technology","discipline","countries","efforts","challenge","investigators","settings"],"language":"en"},

We asked if structured EMR data could be coupled with computerized processing of free-text clinical entries to enhance detection of acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODOLOGY: A manual review of EMR records related to 15,377 outpatient visits uncovered 280 reference cases of ARI. We used logistic regression with backward elimination to determine which among candidate structured EMR parameters (diagnostic codes, vital signs and orders for tests, imaging and medications) contributed to the detection of those reference cases. We also developed a computerized free-text search to identify clinical notes documenting at least two non-negated ARI symptoms. We then used heuristics to build case-detection algorithms that best combined the retained structured EMR parameters with the results of the text analysis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An adjusted grouping of diagnostic codes identified reference ARI patients with a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 96% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 32%. Of the 21 additional structured clinical parameters considered, two contributed significantly to ARI detection: new prescriptions for cough remedies and elevations in body temperature to at least 38\u00B0C. Together with the diagnostic codes, these parameters increased detection sensitivity to 87%, but specificity and PPV declined to 95% and 25%, respectively. Adding text analysis increased sensitivity to 99%, but PPV dropped further to 14%. Algorithms that required satisfying both a query of structured EMR parameters as well as text analysis disclosed PPVs of 52\u201368% and retained sensitivities of 69\u201373%. CONCLUSION: Structured EMR parameters and free-text analyses can be combined into algorithms that can detect ARI cases with new levels of sensitivity or precision. These results highlight potential paths by which repurposed EMR information could facilitate the discovery of epidemics before they cause mass casualties.","publish_time":"2010-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeLisle, Sylvain; South, Brett; Anthony, Jill A.; Kalp, Ericka; Gundlapallli, Adi; Curriero, Frank C.; Glass, Greg E.; Samore, Matthew; Perl, Trish M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/311d15fee68d2a591ffc4e7cc0187b8dae872f9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2954790.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMR","PPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["retained structured EMR parameters","ARI detection","candidate structured EMR parameters","query of structured EMR parameters","EMR information","structured EMR data","detection sensitivity","ARI cases","additional structured clinical parameters","reference cases of ARI","text analysis increased sensitivity","text clinical entries","free-text analyses","reference ARI patients","computerized free-text search","case-detection algorithms","manual review of EMR records","new levels of sensitivity","non-negated ARI symptoms","adjusted grouping of diagnostic codes","clinical notes","computerized processing of free","detection of acute respiratory infections","results","specificity","new prescriptions","rich source of information","cough remedies","orders","vital signs","elevations","outpatient visits","tests","backward elimination","electronic medical record","imaging","body temperature","medications","discovery of epidemics","potential paths","CONCLUSION","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","positive predictive value","logistic regression","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","precision","heuristics","mass casualties","PPVs","epidemic surveillance","sensitivities"],"language":"en"},

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays using a lateral flow test (RPA-nfo) and real-time fluorescent detection (RPA-exo) were developed targeting the 47-kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi or 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. The RPA assay was capable of detecting O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi at levels comparable to that of the quantitative PCR method. Both the RPA-nfo and RPA-exo methods performed similarly with regards to sensitivity when detecting the 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. On the contrary, RPA-exo performed better than RPA-nfo in detecting the 47 kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi. The clinical performance of the O. tsutsugamushi RPA assay was evaluated using either human patient samples or infected mouse samples. Eight out of ten PCR confirmed positives were determined positive by RPA, and all PCR confirmed negative samples were negative by RPA. Similar results were obtained for R. typhi spiked patient sera. The assays were able to differentiate O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi from other phylogenetically related bacteria as well as mouse and human DNA. Furthermore, the RPA-nfo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 37(o)C followed by a 10 minute incubation at room temperature for development of an immunochromatographic strip. The RPA-exo reaction was completed in 20 minutes at 39(o)C. The implementation of a cross contamination proof cassette to detect the RPA-nfo fluorescent amplicons provided an alternative to regular lateral flow detection strips, which are more prone to cross contamination. The RPA assays provide a highly time-efficient, sensitive and specific alternative to other methods for diagnosing scrub typhus or murine typhus.","publish_time":"2015-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chao, Chien-Chung; Belinskaya, Tatyana; Zhang, Zhiwen; Ching, Wei-Mei","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1d863f8297bd6185abeb6564af22eac8bdd3fd3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4498641.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161793/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Orientia","RPA","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RPA assays","tsutsugamushi RPA assay","RPA-nfo reaction","RPA-exo methods","RPA-exo reaction","RPA-nfo fluorescent amplicons","Rickettsia typhi","kDa gene of","detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi","murine typhus","typhi spiked patient sera","negative samples","diagnosing scrub typhus","human patient samples","specific alternative","real-time fluorescent detection","causative agents of scrub typhus","infected mouse samples","minutes","regular lateral flow detection strips","lateral flow test","quantitative PCR method","cross contamination proof cassette","human DNA","development","rapid diagnostic tests","room temperature","minute incubation","implementation","time-efficient","levels comparable","Recombinase polymerase amplification","sensitivity","immunochromatographic strip","related bacteria","clinical performance","regards","positives","Similar results","patients","proper treatment"],"language":"en"},

It demonstrates that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space.

To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested.

METHODS: The survey was conducted in the European Hip Society (EHS) and the European Knee Associates (EKA). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple choice, ranked). Four topics were addressed: (1) origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions); (2) potential disruption of arthroplasty surgeries (12 questions); (3) influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular arthroplasty surgeon (four questions); (4) a matrix provided 14 different arthroplasty surgeries and the participant was asked to state whether dedicated surgery was stopped, delayed or cancelled. RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-two surgeons (217 EHS, 55 EKA) from 40 different countries participated. Of the respondents, 25.7% stated that all surgeries were cancelled in their departments, while 68.4% responded that elective inpatient procedures were no longer being performed. With regard to the specific surgical procedures, nearly all primary TJA were cancelled (92.6%) as well as aseptic revisions (94.7%). In most hospitals, periprosthetic fractures (87.2%), hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures and septic revisions for acute infections (75.8%) were still being performed. CONCLUSION: During the current 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing a near-total shutdown of TJA. A massive cutback was observed for primary TJA and revision TJA, even in massively failed TJA with collapse, dislocation, component failure or imminent dislocation. Only life-threatening pathologies like periprosthetic fractures and acute septic TJA are currently undergoing surgical treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.

In addition, information was collected on animal characteristics and herd-management practices. The probability of detecting each one of five enteropathogens given a calf with \u2018custard-like\u2019 faeces or diarrhoea was estimated using Bayes\u2019 rule and was based on the predicted probabilities from a multinominal model including each of five enteropathogens as independent variables. In addition, putative risk factors for the presence of each of five enteropathogens were analysed using logistic regression models with random herd effects. Fifty-seven percent of calves had faeces of normal colour (brownish) and consistency (firm), 23.8% (95%CI: 19.8\u201328.2%) had \u2018custard-like\u2019 faeces and 19.1% (95%CI: 15.5\u201323.2%) had diarrhoea. E. coli was the least detected enteropathogen (2.6% (95%CI: 1.3\u20134.6%) of calves, 9% (95%CI: 5\u201316%) of herds) and Cl. perfringens was most detected (54.0% (95%CI: 49.1\u201358.8%) of calves, 85% (95%CI: 77\u201391%) of herds). E. coli and Coronavirus were detected incidentally in only one or two calves per herd, whereas C. parvum and Cl. perfringens were frequently detected in up to four calves per herd. For calves with \u2018custard-like\u2019 faeces, the probability of detecting Rotavirus from a calf in its first week of age was 0.31 whereas for a calf in its second week, there was a 0.66 probability of detecting C. parvum. The probabilities of detecting E. coli, Rotavirus and C. parvum in calves with diarrhoea in their first week of age were 0.10, 0.20 and 0.43, respectively. In calves with diarrhoea between 1 and 2 weeks of age, the probability of detecting enteropathogens was 0.43 for C. parvum. None of the tested enteropathogens were related to \u2018custard-like\u2019 faeces or diarrhoea in the third week of age. Putative risk factors for E. coli, Coronavirus and C. parvum included the presence of peer-calves shedding Coronavirus, C. parvum or Rotavirus, respectively. Additionally, managerial risk factors such as non-optimal hygienic housing (for Coronavirus) and the routine use of antibiotics for diarrhoeic calves (for C. parvum) were found. No animal or managerial factors were associated with shedding of Cl. perfringens.","publish_time":"2010-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartels, Chris J.M.; Holzhauer, Menno; Jorritsma, Ruurd; Swart, Wim A.J.M.; Lam, Theo J.G.M.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7eaddf05e4ef451536c240e2a497ad9231b024d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125667.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758770900292X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.09.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758770900292X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19819574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrhoea","diarrhoeic calves","percent of calves","CI","Coronavirus","Cryptosporidium parvum","week of age","Rotavirus","custard consistency","probability","faeces of normal colour","managerial risk factors","putative risk factors","managerial factors","prevalence of non-normal faeces","days of age","weeks of age","Clostridium perfringens","shedding of","calf","Escherichia coli K99","detected enteropathogen","random herd effects","herd-management practices","addition","Dutch dairy herds","animal characteristics","presence of peer","predicted probabilities","non-optimal hygienic housing","logistic regression models","routine use of antibiotics","multinominal model","information","Bayes\u2019 rule","firm","independent variables","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection has provided great potential for the discovery of new antiviral agents that target viral proteins or host factors. Virus-targeting antivirals can function directly or indirectly to inhibit the biological functions of viral proteins, mostly enzymatic activities, or to block viral replication machinery. Host-targeting antivirals target the host proteins that are involved in the viral life cycle, regulating the function of the immune system or other cellular processes in host cells.

METHODS: Salivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR. The following data were collected: age, sex, comorbidities, drugs. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ultrasensitive reactive C protein (usRCP) values were registered on the same day when a salivary swab was collected. Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered. RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects were recruited into this study, 17 males and 8 females. The mean age was 61.5 \u002B/\u2212 11.2 years. Cardiovascular and/or dysmetabolic disorders were observed in 65.22% of cases. All the samples tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while there was an inverse association between LDH and Ct values. Two patients showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or respiratory swabs showed conversion. CONCLUSIONS: Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2.

We previously demonstrated microRNA-21 has potential inhibitory effect on the MAP2K3 which locates upstream of P38 MAPK and was upregulated in mouse hearts upon CVB3 infection. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of miRNA-21 on CVB3 infection remain unclear. METHODS: We detected continuous changes of cellular miRNA-21 and P38 MAPK proteins expression profiling post CVB3 infection in vitro within 12 h. P38 MAPK signaling was inhibited by the specific inhibitor, small interfering RNA and miRNA-21 mimic in vitro, CVB3 replication, cell apoptosis rate and proliferation were detected. Viral load in the mice heart, cardiomyocyte apoptosis rate and histological of the heart were also detected in the mice model of viral myocarditis pretreated with miRNA-21-lentivirus. RESULTS: We observed significant upregulation of miRNA-21 expression followed by suppression of the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling in CVB3-infected Hela cells. The inactivation of the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling by P38 MAPK specific inhibitor, small interfering RNA against MAP2K3, or miRNA-21 overexpression significantly inhibited viral progeny release from CVB3-infected cells. Mechanistically, when compared with control miRNA, miRNA-21 showed no effect on capsid protein VP1 expression and viral load within host cells, while significantly reversing CVB3-induced caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis rate, further promoting proliferation of infected cells, which indicates the inhibitory effect of miRNA-21 on CVB3 progeny release. In the in vivo study, when compared with control miRNA, miRNA-21 pretreatment remarkably inactivated the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling in mice and protected them against CVB3 infection as evidenced by significantly alleviated cell apoptosis rate, reduced viral titers, necrosis in the heart as well as by remarkably prolonged survival time. CONCLUSIONS: miRNA-21 were reverse correlated with P38 MAPK activation post CVB3 infection, miRNA-21 overexpression significantly inhibited viral progeny release and decreased myocytes apoptosis rate in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that miRNA-21 may serve as a potential therapeutic agent against CVB3 infection through targeting the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Feng; Xiao, Zonghui; Yao, Hailan; Li, Sen; Feng, Miao; Wang, Wei; Liu, Zhewei; Liu, Zhuo; Wu, Jianxin","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04510f144938a17bf2c2a9683ce3479ff0246b94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6778380.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585536/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-019-2077-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control miRNA","P38 MAPK activation post CVB3 infection","inhibitory effect of miRNA","CVB3 replication","CVB3-infected cells","P38 MAPK specific inhibitor","CVB3 progeny release","MAP2K3","P38 MAPK proteins expression profiling post CVB3 infection","significant upregulation of miRNA","underlying mechanism of miRNA","CVB3-induced caspase","CVB3-induced diseases","CVB3-infected Hela cells","continuous changes of cellular miRNA","Viral load","viral progeny release","cardiomyocyte apoptosis rate","viral titers","alleviated cell apoptosis rate","decreased myocytes apoptosis rate","P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","mice heart","proliferation of infected cells","mice model of viral myocarditis","potential inhibitory effect","host cells","small interfering RNA","overexpression","capsid protein VP1 expression","potential therapeutic agent","pathway","essential role","mimic","pretreatment","suppression","mouse hearts","necrosis","demonstrated microRNA","BACKGROUND","inactivation","prolonged survival time","METHODS","RESULTS","study","lentivirus","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies identified a motif in the beginning of non-structural gene NS2A of encephalitic flaviviruses including WNV which induces programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (PRF) resulting in production of an additional NS protein NS1\u2032. We have previously demonstrated that mutant WNV with abolished PRF was attenuated in mice. Here we have extended our previous observations by showing that PRF does not appear to have a significant role in virus replication, virion formation, and viral spread in several cell lines in vitro. However, we have also shown that PRF induces an over production of structural proteins over non-structural proteins in virus-infected cells and that mutation abolishing PRF is present in \u223C11% of the wild type virus population. In vivo experiments in house sparrows using wild type and PRF mutant of New York 99 strain of WNV viruses showed some attenuation for the PRF mutant virus. Moreover, PRF mutant of Kunjin strain of WNV showed significant decrease compared to wild type virus infection in dissemination of the virus from the midgut through the haemocoel, and ultimately the capacity of infected mosquitoes to transmit virus. Thus our results demonstrate an important role for PRF in regulating expression of viral genes and consequently virus replication in avian and mosquito hosts.","publish_time":"2014-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melian, Ezequiel Balmori; Hall-Mendelin, Sonja; Du, Fangyao; Owens, Nick; Bosco-Lauth, Angela M.; Nagasaki, Tomoko; Rudd, Stephen; Brault, Aaron C.; Bowen, Richard A.; Hall, Roy A.; van den Hurk, Andrew F.; Khromykh, Alexander A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96456a955d56878dc1e53c0feeb14bf307518b17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4223154.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375107/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV","PRF"],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["PRF mutant virus","virus replication","abolished PRF","mutant WNV","PRF mutant of New York","PRF mutant of Kunjin strain of WNV","wild type virus infection","wild type virus population","virus-infected cells","West Nile virus","strain of WNV viruses","significant role","non-structural proteins","significant decrease","production of structural proteins","viral spread","important role","Previous studies","previous observations","human pathogen of significant medical importance","expression of viral genes","capacity of infected mosquitoes","beginning of non-structural gene NS2A of encephalitic flaviviruses","virion formation","dissemination","attenuation","house sparrows","motif","mutation","additional NS protein NS1","experiments","mosquito hosts","ribosomal frameshift","cases of encephalitis","cell lines","emergence","haemocoel","midgut","results","deaths","mice"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there is no specific therapy available to treat CHIKV infection. In the present study, the in vitro prophylactic and therapeutic effects of chloroquine on CHIKV replication in Vero cells were investigated. Inhibitory effects were observed when chloroquine was administered pre\u2010infection, post\u2010infection, and concurrent with infection, suggesting that chloroquine has prophylactic and therapeutic potential. The inhibitory effects were confirmed by performing a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), real\u2010time reverse transcriptase (RT)\u2010PCR analysis of viral RNA levels, and cell viability assays. Chloroquine diminished CHIKV infection in a dose\u2010dependent manner, with an effective concentration range of 5\u201320 \u00B5M. Concurrent addition of drug with virus, or treatment of cells prior to infection drastically reduced virus infectivity and viral genome copy number by \u226599.99%. The maximum inhibitory effect of chloroquine was observed within 1\u20133 hr post\u2010infection (hpi), and treatment was ineffective once the virus successfully passed through the early stages of infection. The mechanism of inhibition of virus activity by chloroquine involved impaired endosomal\u2010mediated virus entry during early stages of virus replication, most likely through the prevention of endocytosis and/or endosomal acidification, based on a comparative evaluation using ammonium chloride, a known lysosomotropic agent.

Fog computing brings benefits for enhancing the QoE for VoD services by caching the content closer to the user in a multi-tier fog architecture, considering their available resources to improve QoE. In this context, it is mandatory to consider network, fog node, and user metrics to choose an appropriate fog node to distribute videos with QoE support properly. In this article, we introduce a content orchestrator mechanism, called of Fog4Video, which chooses an appropriate fog node to download video content. The mechanism considers the available bandwidth, delay, and cost, besides the QoE metrics for VoD, namely number of stalls and stalls duration, to deploy VoD services in the opportune fog node. Decision-making acknowledges periodical reports of QoE from the clients to assess the video streaming from each fog node. These values serve as inputs for a real-time Analytic Hierarchy Process method to compute the influence factor for each parameter and compute the QoE improvement potential of the fog node. Fog4Video is executed in fog nodes organized in multiple tiers, having different characteristics to provide VoD services. Simulation results demonstrate that Fog4Video transmits adapted videos with 30% higher QoE and reduced monetary cost up to 24% than other content request mechanisms.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santos, Hugo; Alencar, Derian; Meneguette, Rodolfo; Ros\u00E1rio, Denis; Nobre, J\u00E9ferson; Both, Cristiano; Cerqueira, Eduardo; Braun, Torsten","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6284260d77dd380a38be2827b3f38e908eda9d1f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128620304448?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1389128620304448","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["appropriate fog node","opportune fog node","fog nodes","Fog computing","QoE metrics","QoE support","VoD services","higher QoE","video content","QoE improvement potential","periodical reports of QoE","multi-tier fog architecture","content orchestrator mechanisms","content closer","Fog4Video","content request mechanisms","user metrics","Demand","video streaming","Abstract Video","adapted videos","number of stalls","stalls duration","available bandwidth","available resources","monetary cost","real-time Analytic Hierarchy Process method","inputs","parameter","multiple tiers","clients","different characteristics","influence factor","Quality of Experience","delay","network","benefits","Simulation results","Decision-making","values","article","context"],"language":"en"},

Needed to resolve the issue is its cultivation in readily available cell lines. Objectives: To grow HEC in cell lines. To describe its characteristics and to differentiate it from other human and animal coronaviruses. Study design: Originally grown in human fetal intestinal organ culture, HEC was passed in J774 cells (a mouse macrophage cell line) and C6/36 cells (a mosquito cell line). Its cytopathic effect (CPE) and pattern of immunofluorescence were described. Its appearance was ascertained by negative staining and transmission EM. Its structural proteins were delineated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting (WB). The antigenic character of the virus was determined by immunofluorescence and WB. Agglutination with mouse erythrocytes was performed. Results: In J774 cells, HEC induced the formation of giant cells and small syncytia. Immunofluorescence in both J774 and C6/36 cells was limited to the cytoplasm. Studies with transmission EM revealed the virus to have the typical appearance of other coronaviruses, to be 80\u2013120 nm in diameter, and to bud into cysternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. By PAGE and WB, its major protein has an average molecular weight (MW) of 41 kilodaltons (kDa). Two other proteins had MWs of 190 and 24 kDa. By immunofluorescence and WB, HEC is antigenically distinct from human coronaviruses 0C43 and 229E and mouse hepatitis virus (A59 strain). Preparations of HEC did not agglutinate mouse erythrocytes. Conclusion: We conclude that HEC is a human coronavirus that is antigenically unrelated to 0C43 and 229E viruses. Growth of HEC in readily available cell lines should aid in elucidating its role as a pathogen in human diarrheal illnesses.","publish_time":"1999-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luby, J.ames P.; Clinton, R.ebecca; Kurtz, S.tanley","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d92dab4577fdc018f5a513c0e67de65c8f9dd5da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129926.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928019798000671; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928019798000671","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WB","HEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Growth of HEC","Preparations of HEC","J774 cells","WB","human coronaviruses 0C43","available cell lines","mouse macrophage cell line","mouse erythrocytes","mouse hepatitis virus","human diarrheal illnesses","mosquito cell line","existence of human enteric coronavirus","transmission EM","pattern of immunofluorescence","formation of giant cells","human fetal intestinal organ culture","PAGE","C6","animal coronaviruses","kDa","E viruses","structural proteins","typical appearance","major protein","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","average molecular weight","Western blotting","A59 strain","stool","electron microscopy","CPE","small syncytia","pathogen","negative staining","role","cultivation","Abstract Background","cysternae","cytopathic effect","description","kilodaltons","Studies","Results","Study design","diameter","endoplasmic reticulum","issue","antigenic character","MWs","Agglutination","Objectives","nm","cytoplasm","Conclusion","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

We have characterized the specificity of a set of region-specific antisera raised against the 5\u2032-portion of ORF 1a by immunoprecipitation of in vitro-synthesized, C-terminally truncated 1a polypeptides and used these antisera to detect virus-specific proteins in IBV-infected Vero cells. Two antisera, which had specificity for IBV sequences from nucleotides 710 to 2079 and 1355 to 2433, respectively, immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of approximately 87 kDa from IBV-infected Veto cells. In vitro translation of ORF 1a sequence terminating at nucleotide 5763 did not produce this protein unless the in vitro translation products were incubated with Vero cell S10 extracts prepared from either IBV-infected or mock-infected Vero cells. However, processing of the 87-kDa protein was also observed when the same region was expressed in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 expression system.

ROS and p53 play key roles in regulating many kinds of cell process during viral infection, however, the exact function in PEDV-induced apoptosis remains unclear. In this study, the pro-apoptotic effect of PEDV was examined in Vero cells and we observed that PEDV infection increased MDM2 and CBP, promoted p53 phosphorylation at serine 20 and, promoted p53 nuclear translocation, leading to p53 activation in Vero cells. Treatment with the p53 inhibitor PFT-\u03B1 could significantly inhibit PEDV-induced apoptosis. We also observed PEDV infection induced time-dependent ROS accumulation. Treatment with antioxidants, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC), significantly inhibited PEDV-induced apoptosis. Moreover, further inhibition tests were established to prove that p53 was regulated by ROS in PEDV-induced apoptosis. In addition, we also found that p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK were activated in PEDV-infected Vero cells. However, treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the SAPK/JNK inhibitor SP600125 reversed PEDV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that activated p53 and accumulated ROS participated in PEDV-induced apoptosis and p53 could be regulated by ROS during PEDV infection. Activated p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK exerted no influence on PEDV-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into the function of p53 and ROS in the interaction of PEDV with Vero cells.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xingang; Xu, Ying; Zhang, Qi; Yang, Feng; Yin, Zheng; Wang, Lixiang; Li, Qinfan","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99c67fd785a00b054ff5cf8dc9d88546f254321e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117205.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519301658; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.03.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030832/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519301658","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","CBP","SAPK/JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","interaction of PEDV","inhibited PEDV-induced apoptosis","activated p53","PEDV-infected Vero cells","function of p53","p53 activation","p53 phosphorylation","pro-apoptotic effect of PEDV","p53 nuclear translocation","p53 inhibitor PFT-\u03B1","accumulated ROS","SAPK","Activated p38 MAPK","Treatment","viral infection","p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580","JNK inhibitor SP600125","time-dependent ROS accumulation","study","exact function","severe watery diarrhea","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","piglets","CBP","high morbidity","kinds of cell process","serine","MDM2","N-acetylcysteine","influence","pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate","member of Coronavirus","key roles","PDTC","NAC","new insights","mortality","findings","antioxidants","results","inhibition tests","addition"],"language":"en"},

MDCK-33016PF cells are used in propagation of a cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine (Optaflu\u00AE); but, like most continuous cell lines, can grow in immunocompromised mice to produce tumors. It is, therefore, essential that no residual cells remain within the vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses or oncogenic DNA. Multiple, redundant processes ensure the safety of influenza vaccines produced in MDCK-33016PF cells. The probability of a residual cell being present in a dose of vaccine is approximately 1 in 1034. Residual MDCK-DNA is \u226410ng per dose and the \u00DF-propiolactone used to inactivate influenza virus results in reduction of detectable DNA to less than 200base pairs (bp). Degenerate PCR and specific PCR confirm exclusion of oncogenic viruses. The manufacturing process has been validated for its capacity to remove and inactivate viruses. We conclude that the theoretical risks arising from manufacturing seasonal influenza vaccine using MDCK-33016PF cells are reduced to levels that are effectively zero by the multiple, orthogonal processes used during production.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Onions, David; Egan, William; Jarrett, Ruth; Novicki, Deborah; Gregersen, Jens-Peter","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85cf0d4fd0de528e8178161a44d55112650d1058.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129197.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105610000989; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105610000989; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2010.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537553/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oncogenic DNA","manufacturing seasonal influenza vaccine","seasonal influenza vaccines","Residual MDCK-DNA","influenza pandemics","cell substrate","cell lysates","PF cells","residual cells","safety of influenza vaccines","dose of vaccine","influenza virus results","exclusion of oncogenic viruses","continuous cell lines","Abstract Cell culture-based production methods","production flexibility","reduction of detectable DNA","specific PCR","Degenerate PCR","redundant processes","orthogonal processes","manufacturing process","meeting","demand","\u00DF-propiolactone","theoretical risks","propagation","immunocompromised mice","base pairs","Optaflu","tumors","bp","capacity","levels","probability"],"language":"en"},

Methods The present study is an attempt to elucidate inhibition potential of andrographolide and its derivatives along with an associated binding mechanism through virtual screening and molecular docking simulation studies. Results Our findings revealed structural conformation changes in 150 loop, secondary sialic acid binding site residues of ACZ97474 {Neuraminidase (A/Blore/NIV236/2009(H1N1)}. Andrographolide have been identified as the highest binging energy of \u221210.88 Kcal/mol, 3 hydrogen bond interactions (Arg152, Lys150, and Gly197), total intermolecular energy of \u221212.07 Kcal/mol with bioactivity value (Ki) of 10.59 nmol/L, while the Food and Drug Admistraton approved drug Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have shown 2 and 4 hydrogen bond interactions with binding energies of \u22126.28 Kcal/mol and \u22127.73Kcal/mol, respectively, which is higher than andrographolide. The guanidine group of Arg152 has binding affinities to the hydrophilic nature of the inhibitors (-OH and =O groups), as identified by docking of andrographolide (CID: 5318517) on neuraminidase. Conclusions Hence, andrographolide has the potential to inhibit neuraminidase activity of H1N1 and may be used as an alternative medicinal therapy for swine flu positive patient. With potent antiviral activity and a potentially new mechanism of action, andrographolide may warrant further evaluation as a possible therapy for influenza.","publish_time":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seniya, Chandrabhan; Shrivastava, Shilpi; Singh, Sanjay Kumar; Khan, Ghulam Jilani","journal":"Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e1cee666688c90bef9840dbb9d98f20f1cf15f4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s2222-1808(14)60692-7; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2222180814606927; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2222180814606927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289026/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Food and Drug Admistraton"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Kcal","inhibition potential of andrographolide","binding energies","associated binding mechanism","neuraminidase activity of H1N1","hydrogen bond interactions","new mechanism of action","treatment of swine flu","possible therapy","secondary sialic acid binding site residues of ACZ97474","Drug Admistraton approved drug Oseltamivir","new bioactive molecules","total intermolecular energy","alternative medicinal therapy","highest binging energy","guanidine group of Arg152","potent antiviral activity","molecular docking simulation studies","loop","virtual screening","Food","Zanamivir","attempt","Lys150","derivatives","structural conformation changes","affinities","Gly197","evaluation","positive patient","bioactivity value","OH","inhibitors","hydrophilic nature","Abstract Objective","Blore","present study","Methods","findings","nmol","influenza","NIV236","O groups","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID\u201019 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID\u201019 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital. RESULTS: Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID\u201019 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%).

Second, for incoming refugees, we must focus on building inclusive, cost-effective health services to promote collective health security.

BRSV has been recognized as a major cause of respiratory disease in young calves since the early 1970s. The analysis of BRSV infection was originally hampered by its characteristic lability and poor growth in vitro. However, the advent of numerous immunological and molecular methods has facilitated the study of BRSV enormously. The knowledge gained from these studies has also provided the opportunity to develop safe, stable, attenuated virus vaccine candidates. Nonetheless, many aspects of the epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and evolution of the virus are still not fully understood. The natural course of infection is rather complex and further complicates diagnosis, treatment and the implementation of preventive measures aimed to control the disease. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which BRSV is able to establish infection is needed to prevent viral and disease spread. This review discusses important information regarding the epidemiology and molecular epidemiology of BRSV worldwide, and it highlights the importance of viral evolution in virus transmission.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarmiento-Silva, Rosa Elena; Nakamura-Lopez, Yuko; Vaughan, Gilberto","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e2dc7663e6a6b53d6b8f37f5ccd4e6dc0c71a57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3528274.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202546/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v4123452","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular epidemiology of BRSV","study of BRSV","analysis of BRSV infection","virus transmission","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","single-stranded RNA virus","molecular methods","attenuated virus vaccine candidates","disease spread","major cause of respiratory disease","importance of viral evolution","natural course of infection","negative sense","pneumovirus genus","young calves","treatment","important information","implementation of preventive measures","advent of numerous immunological","characteristic lability","poor growth","opportunity","diagnosis","family Paramyxoviridae","review","aspects","studies","mechanisms","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

For this, both ACE and AII have been widely exploited as pharmacological targets in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure or diabetic nephropathy by means of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists, respectively [1]. In addition, homologous ACE2 receptors have been identified on the oral mucosa, in type-II pneumocytes, along the intestine and on the kidney and heart endothelia [1], [2]; these receptors have been found overexpressed in course of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists administration in murine models [3], [4]. Hypothesis Surprisingly, the surface spike proteins of the \u2018severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2\u2019 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the ongoing \u2018coronavirus disease 2019\u2019 (COVID-19), are able to bind the ACE2 receptors [2]. Therefore, a hypothesis arises: could a chronic therapeutic assumption of ACE inhibitors or AII receptor antagonists have induced several elderly and middle-aged patients to be more vulnerable to the virus by upregulating ACE2 receptors? If we translate the murine model to the human cells, the expected result would be that shown in the figure (Fig. 1). In our opinion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be more prudent to replace these drugs, when possible, with calcium channel blockers, adrenergic receptor blockers, diuretics or vasodilators.

METHODS: The authors evaluated children aged 0\u201316 y with clinical symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections who were administered rapid strep A test and/or throat culture test and/or respiratory viral panel test, from February 2012 through January 2013 at pediatric department of Ac\u0131badem Maslak Hospital, Turkey. RESULTS: A total of 1654 patients were evaluated; 45.9 % were girls, 54.1 % were boys. Absence of cough and presence of headache were higher in the patients \u003E6 y of age (p 0.0001, p 0.002 respectively). Positive respiratory viral panel test was higher in the patients \u003C2 y of age (p 0.002).

A key factor regarding VLP safety is the lack of viral genomic material, which enhances safety during both manufacture and administration. Contemporary VLP production may take advantage of several systems, including bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian cells. The choice of production platform depends on several factors, including cost and the need for post-translational modifications (PTMs), which can be essential in generating an optimal immune response. Some VLP-based vaccines designed to prevent several infectious diseases are already approved and on the market, with many others at the clinical trial or research stage.

The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world that have adopted aspects of the Western lifestyle, and the disease poses a substantial global health and economic burden. Asthma involves both the large-conducting and the small-conducting airways, and is characterized by a combination of inflammation and structural remodelling that might begin in utero. Disease progression occurs in the context of a developmental background in which the postnatal acquisition of asthma is strongly linked with allergic sensitization. Most asthma cases follow a variable course, involving viral-induced wheezing and allergen sensitization, that is associated with various underlying mechanisms (or endotypes) that can differ between individuals. Each set of endotypes, in turn, produces specific asthma characteristics that evolve across the lifecourse of the patient. Strong genetic and environmental drivers of asthma interconnect through novel epigenetic mechanisms that operate prenatally and throughout childhood. Asthma can spontaneously remit or begin de novo in adulthood, and the factors that lead to the emergence and regression of asthma, irrespective of age, are poorly understood. Nonetheless, there is mounting evidence that supports a primary role for structural changes in the airways with asthma acquisition, on which altered innate immune mechanisms and microbiota interactions are superimposed. On the basis of the identification of new causative pathways, the subphenotyping of asthma across the lifecourse of patients is paving the way for more-personalized and precise pathway-specific approaches for the prevention and treatment of asthma, creating the real possibility of total prevention and cure for this chronic inflammatory disease.

This impression is supported by the relative lack of scientific publications related to feline vector-borne infections. This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit. A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats, including factors related to the lifestyle and behaviour of the cat, lesser spend on preventative healthcare for cats and reduced opportunities for research funding for these animals. The dog and cat have substantially similar immune system components, but differences in immune function might in part account for the markedly distinct prevalence and clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune, allergic, idiopathic inflammatory, immunodeficiency, neoplastic and infectious diseases in the two species. Cats have greater genetic diversity than dogs with much lower linkage disequilibrium in feline compared with canine breed groups. Immune function is intrinsically related to the nature of the intestinal microbiome and subtle differences between the canine and feline microbial populations might also impact on immune function and disease resistance. The reasons for the apparent lesser susceptibility of cats to arthropod-borne infectious diseases are likely to be complex, but warrant further investigation.","publish_time":"2016-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Day, Michael J.","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d1b4e1200c1da4dff5048bdff36805e28511154.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5028948.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646278/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1798-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases","immune function","apparent lesser susceptibility of cats","dogs","feline vector","lower prevalence","arthropod vectors","account","similar immune system components","feline microbial populations","subtle differences","distinct prevalence","immunological resistance","disease resistance","possible reasons","lower linkage disequilibrium","canine breed groups","common small companion animal species","reduced opportunities","clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune","immunodeficiency","preventative healthcare","research funding","fewer zoonotic pathogens","greater genetic diversity","relative lack of scientific publications","intestinal microbiome","nature","behaviour","hypothesis","factors","man","animals","number of simple possibilities","lifestyle","microparasites","impression","review","infections","investigation"],"language":"en"},

However, there has been limited research describing the uptake and use of cattle vaccines on UK farms. AIM: To describe the current uptake and usage of cattle vaccines in the UK. DESIGN: A questionnaire, available in paper and online format, was distributed to cattle farmers by convenience sampling. PARTICIPANTS: All UK cattle farmers were eligible to participate in the study. RESULTS: Eighty-six per cent of respondents (n=229/266) had vaccinated their cattle in the past year. Diseases most commonly vaccinated against were Bovine Viral Diarrhoea, Leptospirosis and Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis. Vaccination compliance was limited in certain areas, for example only 48 per cent of respondents stated that they administered the second dose in the primary course within the recommended timeframe, and 14 per cent of respondents stated that they vaccinated earlier than the youngest recommended age. Although outside the scope of this study, further work is needed to establish the extent of inadequate compliance and the effect this has on vaccine efficacy. The role of the veterinarian was highlighted as the main supplier of vaccines and preferred source of vaccination information. Respondents preferred to receive recommendations regarding vaccination by face-to-face communication with the veterinarian. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a description of the current uptake and usage of cattle vaccines in the UK. Uptake is generally high but there are areas of usage of vaccines which could be improved upon. The veterinarian plays a key role as supplier of vaccines and a source of information for the majority of farmers. Although outside the scope of this study, further work is needed to establish the extent of inadequate compliance and the effect this has on vaccine efficacy. Although the respondents in this study represent a biased population of farmers, the findings indicate areas for future investigation in order to improve vaccination strategies in cattle in the UK.","publish_time":"2014-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cresswell, E.; Brennan, M.

Therefore, we have evaluated the potential anti-CCHFV activity of several molecules targeting this entry possibility. We identified two molecules chloroquine and chlorpromazine. Neutralization and virus yield reduction assays were tested in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells on two different CCHFV strains. Several combinations, including ribavirin, were assayed to test a potential synergistic effect. The two molecules inhibited CCHFV, and depending on the virus and the cell lines, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for chloroquine and chlorpromazine ranged from 28 to 43 and 10.8\u201315.7\u03BCM, respectively. Time-of-addition studies demonstrated that these molecules had a direct effect on CCHFV infectivity and spread. The antiviral activity of the two molecules was still effective even when added up to 6h post-infection and up to 24h. The selectivity index ranging from 3 to 35 lead us to evaluate combinations with ribavirin. Combinations of ribavirin and chloroquine or chlorpromazine were synergistic against CCHFV. Though the low chlorpromazine selectivity index suggests the need for a chemical improvement, our present study highlights chloroquine as the main drug having the potential for drug repurposing.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferraris, O.; Moroso, M.; Pernet, O.; Emonet, S.; Ferrier Rembert, A.; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, G.; Peyrefitte, C.

Resources are scarce, and allocating them to disease mitigation instead of other uses necessarily involves the loss of alternative sources of benefit to people. For society to obtain the maximum benefits from using resources, the gains from disease mitigation must be compared to the resource costs, guiding decisions made with the objective of achieving the optimal net outcome. DISCUSSION: Economics provides criteria to guide decisions aimed at optimising the net benefits from the use of scarce resources. Assessing the benefits of disease mitigation is no exception. However, the technical complexity of mitigation means that economic evaluation is not straightforward because of the technical relationship of surveillance to intervention. We argue that analysis of the magnitudes and distribution of benefits and costs for any given strategy, and hence the outcome in net terms, requires that mitigation is considered in three conceptually distinct stages. In Stage I, \u0027sustainment\u0027, the mitigation objective is to sustain a free or acceptable status by preventing an increase of a pathogen or eliminating it when it occurs. The role of surveillance is to document that the pathogen remains below a defined threshold, giving early warning of an increase in incidence or other significant changes in risk, and enabling early response. If a pathogen is not contained, the situation needs to be assessed as Stage II, \u0027investigation\u0027. Here, surveillance obtains critical epidemiological information to decide on the appropriate intervention strategy to reduce or eradicate a disease in Stage III, \u0027implementation\u0027. Stage III surveillance informs the choice, timing, and scale of interventions and documents the progress of interventions directed at prevalence reduction in the population. SUMMARY: This article originates from a research project to develop a conceptual framework and practical tool for the economic evaluation of surveillance. Exploring the technical relationship between mitigation as a source of economic value and surveillance and intervention as sources of economic cost is crucial. A framework linking the key technical relationships is proposed. Three conceptually distinct stages of mitigation are identified. Avian influenza, salmonella, and foot and mouth disease are presented to illustrate the framework.","publish_time":"2011-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00E4sler, Barbara; Howe, Keith S; St\u00E4rk, Katharina DC","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc5a448b2c227817cd29625972acb40e853cac89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3189394.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-11-225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21929812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["benefits of disease mitigation","mitigation objective","economic evaluation of surveillance","technical relationship of surveillance","technical complexity of mitigation","role of surveillance","distinct stages of mitigation","net benefits","mouth disease","pathogen","unwanted effects of disease","distribution of benefits","maximum benefits","sources of economic cost","appropriate intervention strategy","source of economic value","increase","conceptual framework","resource costs","decisions","optimal net outcome","key technical relationships","net terms","use of scarce resources","early warning","progress of interventions","scale of interventions","given strategy","early response","loss of alternative sources of benefit","incidence","practical tool","risk","salmonella","foot","significant changes","prevalence reduction","research project","activities of strategies","defined threshold","magnitudes","critical epidemiological information","timing","choice","uses","gains","article","Avian influenza","Economics","criteria","acceptable status","people","BACKGROUND","sustainment","exception","DISCUSSION","population","analysis","society","situation","implementation","SUMMARY","investigation"],"language":"en"},

Data indicate that the virus is responsible for recent clinical cases of dog disease in China. However, therapeutic options for this disease are very limited. In this study, seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CIV JS/10 (an H3N2 subtype virus) were produced and characterized. Among them, mAb D7, which is specific for the HA2 glycopeptide (gp), induced the highest neutralization titers. The protection provided by mAb D7 was evaluated in BALB/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of H3N2 influenza virus, including two strains of CIV and one strain of swine influenza virus (SIV). The data show that mAb D7 protected the mice from infection with the three viral strains, especially the homologous strain, which was indicated by the recovery of body weight, reduction of viral load, and reduction of tissue damage. Moreover, the levels of IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 in the lungs, as detected by ELISA, were reduced in the infected mice treated with the mAb D7 compared with those without mAb D7 treatment. Thus, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a mAb could reduce the release of IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 associated with tissue damage by CIV infection and that the mAb might be of great therapeutic value for CIV infection.

The aim of this study was to determine the viral load in different body sites. Viral loads of pandemic H1N1 virus in respiratory specimens, stool, urine, and serum were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). Respiratory specimens from patients with seasonal influenza were used as historical controls. Initial pre\u2010treatment viral load were compared between these two groups. Serial respiratory specimens from patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection were obtained for analysis of viral dynamics. Twenty\u2010two pandemic H1N1 cases and 44 seasonal influenza historical controls were included. The mean initial viral load before oseltamivir therapy was 1.84 \u00D7 10(8) copies/ml for pandemic H1N1 virus compared with 3.28 \u00D7 10(8) copies/ml in seasonal influenza historical controls (P = 0.085). Among patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection, peak viral load occurred on the day of onset of symptoms, and declined gradually afterwards, with no virus being detectable in respiratory specimens by RT\u2010PCR 8 days and by culture 5 days after the onset of symptoms respectively, except in one patient. Pandemic H1N1 virus was detected in stool and in urine from 4/9 and 1/14 patients, respectively. Viral culture was also positive from the stool sample with the highest viral load. Younger age was associated with prolonged shedding in the respiratory tract and higher viral load in the stool. Data from this quantitative analysis of viral shedding may have implications for formulating infection control measures. J. Med.

In HCoV-229E, its receptor binding domain (RBD) shows extensive sequence variation but how S-protein function is maintained is not understood. Reported are the X-ray crystal structures of Class III-V RBDs in complex with human aminopeptidase N (hAPN), as well as the electron cryomicroscopy structure of the 229E S-protein. The structures show that common core interactions define the specificity for hAPN and that the peripheral RBD sequence variation is accommodated by loop plasticity. The results provide insight into immune evasion and the cross-species transmission of 229E and related coronaviruses. We also find that the 229E S-protein can expose a portion of its helical core to solvent. This is undoubtedly facilitated by hydrophilic subunit interfaces that we show are conserved among coronaviruses. These interfaces likely play a role in the S-protein conformational changes associated with membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhijie; Tomlinson, Aidan CA; Wong, Alan HM; Zhou, Dongxia; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J; Benlekbir, Samir; Rubinstein, John L; Rini, James M","journal":"eLife","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6091444b4f7495b1b4cb0c72b6f30da73ccf867d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6970540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650956/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.51230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E S-protein","coronavirus S-protein","S-protein function","S-protein conformational changes","hAPN","peripheral RBD sequence variation","extensive sequence variation","receptor binding domain","membrane fusion","helical core","related coronaviruses","common core interactions","hydrophilic subunit interfaces","X-ray crystal structures of Class","V RBDs","complex","cross-species transmission","human aminopeptidase N","immune evasion","specificity","portion","insight","role","host cell membranes","electron cryomicroscopy structure","loop plasticity","results","solvent","HCoV"],"language":"en"},

Authorities and physicians are still learning how COVID-19 affects people with underlying diseases, and severe asthma is not an exception. Unless relevant data emerges that changes our understanding of the relative safety of medications indicated in patients with asthma during this pandemic, clinicians must follow the recommendations of current evidence-based guidelines, preventing loss of control and exacerbations. Also, with the absence of data that would indicate any potential harm, current advice is to continue the administration of biologic agents during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with asthma for whom such agents are clearly indicated and have been effective. For the patients with severe asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, the decision to maintain or postpone biologic therapy until the patient recovers should be a case-by-case based decision supported by a multidisciplinary team.

An intriguing observation has been the near absence of children in initial disease reports, mild disease overall in child cases, no reported deaths in children aged \u003C10 years of age and suggestions that minimally symptomatic children may facilitate disease transmission within communities.1-6 Li et al. report three child cases of confirmed COVID\u201019 infection7; the report is notable for at least two reasons. Firstly, the report describes a mild disease course amongst young children with no symptoms of respiratory distress, no clinical indication for hospitalisation, minimal changes on chest computed tomography and complete recovery in the short term. This raises multiple questions such as: (i) whether the low frequency of confirmed COVID\u201019 infections in children reflects case detection bias due to attenuated disease severity in children; (ii) whether undiagnosed child infections contribute to community transmission; (iii) the biological basis for the attenuated disease severity, if this is indeed the case; and (iv) the role of existing co\u2010morbidity in children, given indications that \u2013 as well as older age \u2013 co\u2010morbidity is a major determinant of disease severity in adults.2, 8 Secondly, the report describes the use of nebulised interferon\u2010\u03B1 in two cases, with to our knowledge no data on efficacy and limited information on safety, while nebulisation poses a transmission risk in healthcare environments, as observed with the nearly identical SARS coronavirus.9 While the use of novel/experimental therapies may be justified in a desperate situation, every indication is that this is not required in young children with minimal symptoms. The imperative to \u2018do anything possible\u2019 will be felt by all paediatricians caring for children with COVID\u201019; however, the \u2018first do no harm\u2019 principle should certainly apply in all situations where the natural history of disease is poorly described or indicative of likely spontaneous recovery without any treatment. Clinicians should always balance potential risks and benefits to the individual patient with assiduous attention to infection control to protect other vulnerable patients within the health\u2010care environment and the public at large. The report by Li et al.7 is valuable given the scant information available on children with COVID\u201019, but detailed case descriptions with better documentation of the full disease course would have been more informative. Paediatricians around the world should endeavour to collect comprehensive clinical data and biological specimens including longitudinal sampling from cases wherever they occur in order to further our understanding of the clinical features, pathogenesis of disease and host response in children infected with COVID\u201019.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Britton, Philip N; Marais, Ben J","journal":"Journal of paediatrics and child health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.14872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202002/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["disease transmission","young children","symptomatic children","pathogenesis of disease","attenuated disease severity","mild disease course","near absence of children","initial disease reports","natural history of disease","major determinant of disease severity","child cases of confirmed COVID","rapid spread of COVID","clinical indication","low frequency of confirmed COVID","clinical features","comprehensive clinical data","undiagnosed child infections","minimal symptoms","transmission risk","community transmission","paediatricians","case detection bias","detailed case descriptions","biological specimens","minimal changes","complete recovery","limited information","biological basis","role of existing co\u2010morbidity","older age","years of age","use of novel","symptoms of respiratory distress","scant information available","use of nebulised interferon","indicative of likely spontaneous recovery","individual patient","chest computed tomography","hospitalisation","infection control","nebulisation","better documentation","vulnerable patients","assiduous attention","longitudinal sampling","host response","benefits","efficacy","China","Wuhan","safety","adults","infection7","potential risks","reported deaths","understanding","recent emergence","situations","knowledge","suggestions","indications","ongoing global challenge","communities","experimental therapies","short term","healthcare environments","public","intriguing observation","treatment","world","identical SARS coronavirus","desperate situation","principle","Clinicians","order","reasons","multiple questions","imperative","harm"],"language":"en"},

The secondary objectives are to investigate the quality of life (QOL) and symptomology changes among the herbal users and to evaluate the safety of this formula. METHODS: In ten old people\u2019s home or community centres in New Territories, Hong Kong, 740 eligible subjects agreed to join the study and were randomized to receive a herbal formula or a placebo on alternate days over 8 weeks. Among those 740 participants, 113 had provided blood samples for immunological assessments before and after the study drug. Assessments were done at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Participants were instructed to keep a daily record of body temperature and any symptoms as sore throat, myalgia, running nose or cough, and to report to assessor accordingly. Those reporting body temperature of 37.8 \u00B0C and above would be visited and a proper nasopharyngeal swab be taken for viral study. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants developed influenza-like-symptoms but none of them was proven influenza in their nasopharyngeal swabs, 40 of these patients belonged to the herbal group and 32 to the placebo group, without significant differences between groups. The difference on the changes in QOL between the two groups was not statistically significant. However, in the immunological study, the natural killer cell absolute count was significantly increased in the herbal group compared with the placebo group (463\u00B1253 vs 413\u00B1198, P\u003C0.05).

It is the only approved drug for Human use in the large class of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids. This natural product, mainly isolated from the plant Stephania cephalantha Hayata, exhibits multiple pharmacological properties including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, immuno-regulatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral and anti-parasitic properties. Purpose The mechanism of action of CEP is multifactorial. The drug exerts membrane effects (modulation of efflux pumps, membrane rigidification) as well as different intracellular and nuclear effects. CEP interferes with several metabolic axes, primarily with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NF\u03BAB signaling pathways. In particular, the anti-inflammatory effects of CEP rely on AMPK activation and NF\u03BAB inhibition. Conclusion In this review, the historical discovery and development of CEP are retraced, and the key mediators involved in its mode of action are presented. The past, present, and future of CEP are recapitulated. This review also suggests new opportunities to extend the clinical applications of this well-tolerated old Japanese drug.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bailly, Christian","journal":"Phytomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24c1019ec7fae9b5990dff2a375859092ba7123a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126782.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711319301254; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2019.152956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132753/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711319301254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEP"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["anti-inflammatory effects of CEP","development of CEP","future of CEP","anti-cancer","membrane effects","approved drug","anti-parasitic properties","nuclear effects","review","well-tolerated old Japanese drug","AMPK activation","membrane rigidification","NF\u03BAB inhibition","mode of action","mechanism of action","multiple pharmacological properties","clinical applications","modulation of efflux pumps","treatment of leukopenia","plant Stephania cephalantha Hayata","Human use","snake bites","chronic diseases","AMP-activated protein kinase","number of acute","large class of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids","historical discovery","xerostomia","new opportunities","Abstract Background Cepharanthine","alopecia","key mediators","metabolic axes","past","Conclusion","pathways","natural product"],"language":"en"},

AcV1, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, reacts with the 64K protein and in doing so prevents efficient entry. In this communication we report that treatment of AcMNPV BV with either trypsin or proteinase K cleaves the 64K protein into one major fragment of 34.6K and two minor fragments of 36K to 37.2K that are retained with the virus. All of the fragments are glycosylated. Protease treatment does not reduce viral infectivity, but it does result in the destruction of the AcV1-reactive epitope; thus AcV1 is not able to neutralize protease-treated AcMNPV BV. Polyclonal antiserum to BV is able to recognize both cleaved and uncleaved 64K and neutralize both protease-treated and untreated virus. Protease treatment does not diminish the sensitivity of AcMNPV BV to chloroquine, but it does cause the virus to become more susceptible to inactivation by 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) even though exposure to 2-ME does not result in dissociation of the fragments from the virus.","publish_time":"1988-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Volkman, Loy E.; Goldsmith, Phyllis A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/495c7768981515cf5d976017d5601c4d3e08b460.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682288901766; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288901766","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AcMNPV BV"],"locations":["BV"],"keyphrases":["treatment of AcMNPV BV","protease-treated AcMNPV BV","sensitivity of AcMNPV BV","functional entry of AcMNPV BV","Protease treatment","untreated virus","minor fragments","surface protein of budded Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus","AcV1-reactive epitope","efficient entry","Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-SF","cells","proteinase","trypsin","adsorptive endocytosis","neutralizing monoclonal antibody","destruction","inactivation","role","Polyclonal antiserum","viral infectivity","chloroquine","major fragment","mercaptoethanol","dissociation","communication","exposure"],"language":"en"},

This suggests that the country is at continuous risk. The epidemic level of MERS-CoV infection was examined in Saudi Arabia by the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model using a Bayesian approach for estimation of time dependent reproduction number (R) across a two-year interval (May, 2013-May, 2015) in five defined clusters, followed by sensitivity analysis of the most significant clusters. Significant MERS-CoV peaks were detected in the period between March and May of each year. Moreover, MERS-CoV infection was highlighted in western (40.8%) and central (31.9%) regions, followed by eastern region (20%). The temporal-based Bayesian approach indicated a sub-critical epidemic in all regions in the baseline scenario (R: 0.85\u20130.97). However, R potential limit was exceeded in the sensitivity analysis scenario in only central and western regions (R: 1.08\u20131.12) that denoted epidemic level in those regions.

SVA was originally identified as a cell culture contaminant and was not associated with disease until 2007 when it was first observed in pigs with Idiopathic Vesicular Disease (IVD). Vesicular disease is sporadically observed in swine, is not debilitating, but is significant due to its resemblance to foreign animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), whose presence would be economically devastating to the United States. IVD disrupts swine production until foreign animal diseases can be ruled out. Identification and characterization of SVA as a cause of IVD will help to quickly rule out infection by foreign animal diseases. METHODS: We have developed and characterized an indirect ELISA assay to specifically identify serum antibodies to SVA. Viral protein 1, 2 and 3 (VP1, VP2, VP3) were expressed, isolated, and purified from E. coli and used to coat plates for an indirect ELISA. Sera from pigs with and without IVD symptoms as well as a time course following animals from an infected farm, were analyzed to determine the antibody responses to VP1, VP2, and VP3. RESULTS: Antibody responses to VP2 were higher than VP1 and VP3 and showed high affinity binding on an avidity ELISA. ROC analysis of the SVA VP2 ELISA showed a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 89.7%. Compared to IFA, the quantitative ELISA showed an 89% agreement in negative samples and positive samples from 4\u201360 days after appearance of clinical signs. Immune sera positive for FMDV, encephalomyocarditis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus antibodies did not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS: A simple ELISA based on detection of antibodies to SVA VP2 will help to differentially diagnose IVD due to SVA and rule out the presence of economically devastating foreign animal diseases.","publish_time":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dvorak, Cheryl M.

However, the ability of glial cell preparations to remyelinate in such models does not necessarily indicate that their transplantation into demyelinated lesions in clinical disease will be successful. One of the precluding factors in this regard is a greater understanding of the environmental conditions that will support transplant-mediated remyelination. In this study, we determined whether the complex and reactive CNS environment of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) could support transplant-mediated remyelination. Striatal neural precursors derived from postnatal day 1 mice were committed to a glial cell lineage and labeled. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that this population generated \u003E93% glial cells following differentiation in vitro. Transplantation of glial-committed progenitor cells into the T8 spinal cord of MHV-infected mice demonstrating complete hindlimb paralysis resulted in migration of cells up to 12 mm from the implantation site and remyelination of up to 67% of axons. Transplanted-remyelinated animals contained approximately 2\u00D7 the number of axons within sampled regions of the ventral and lateral columns as compared to non-transplanted animals, suggesting that remyelination is associated with axonal sparing. Furthermore, transplantation resulted in behavioral improvement. This study demonstrates for the first time that transplant-mediated remyelination is possible in the pathogenic environment of the MHV demyelination model and that it is associated with locomotor improvement.","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Totoiu, Minodora O.; Nistor, Gabriel I.; Lane, Thomas E.; Keirstead, Hans S.","journal":"Experimental Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7329d423a2663b0dad3899fd5d073862f95cc53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125733.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001448860400041X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001448860400041X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Transplantation of glial","transplant-mediated remyelination","myelinogenic properties of glial cells","glial cell lineage","progenitor cells","migration of cells","MHV demyelination model","documented following transplantation","ability of glial cell preparations","study","non-transplanted animals","infected mice","regions of focal experimental demyelination","pathogenic environment","T8 spinal cord of MHV","sampled regions","animal models","number of axons","remyelinated animals","behavioral improvement","locomotor improvement","reactive CNS environment","model of multiple sclerosis","mouse hepatitis virus","complete hindlimb paralysis","lateral columns","postnatal day","clinical disease","ventral","MS","greater understanding","demyelinated lesions","environmental conditions","Striatal neural precursors","regard","population","time","precluding factors","Immunohistochemical staining","axonal sparing","implantation site","differentiation"],"language":"en"},

Up to date, it has resulted in 1826 human infections, including 649 deaths. Analogous to picornavirus 3C protease (3Cpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is critical for initiation of the MERS-CoV replication cycle and is thus regarded as a validated drug target. As presented here, our peptidomimetic inhibitors of enterovirus 3Cpro (6b, 6c and 6d) inhibited 3CLpro of MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with IC50 values ranging from 1.7 to 4.7 \u03BCM and from 0.2 to 0.7 \u03BCM, respectively. In MERS-CoV-infected cells, the inhibitors showed antiviral activity with EC50 values ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 \u03BCM, by downregulating the viral protein production in cells as well as reducing secretion of infectious viral particles into culture supernatants. They also suppressed other \u03B1- and \u03B2-CoVs from human and feline origin. These compounds exhibited good selectivity index (over 70 against MERS-CoV) and could lead to the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against emerging CoVs and picornaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Vathan; Shin, Jin Soo; Shie, Jiun-Jie; Ku, Keun Bon; Kim, Chonsaeng; Go, Yun Young; Huang, Kai-Fa; Kim, Meehyein; Liang, Po-Huang","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa3bf55b8d7c751c5dc8d18c208e8e1fd9064664.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113684.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28216367/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216305083; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216305083","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","CLpro of MERS","MERS-CoV replication cycle","\u03BCM","C protease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory illness","Cpro","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","antiviral activity","emerging CoVs","infected cells","\u03B2-CoVs","EC50 values","IC50 values","human infections","peptidomimetic inhibitors of enterovirus","viral protein production","development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs","secretion of infectious viral particles","fever","cough","initiation","culture supernatants","picornaviruses","good selectivity index","shortness of breath","feline origin","compounds","validated drug target","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Limited information about T. gondii infection in bats is available in China. The objective of the present study was to determine prevalence and genetic characterization of T. gondii infection in bats in Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces, China. METHODS: During May 2005 to August 2013, bats were sampled from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, China, and liver tissues were collected for the detection of T. gondii by a nested PCR targeting the B1 gene. The positive samples were genotyped at 11 genetic markers (SAG1, 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, c22-8, c29-2, and Apico) using multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: A total of 626 bats representing 10 species were examined for T. gondii infection, 38 (6.1%) were tested positive with by PCR, 8 positive DNA samples were completely genotyped, of which 3 samples (2 from Cynopterus sphinx, and 1 from Murina leucogaster) represented ToxoDB#10, and 5 samples (2 from Murina leucogaster, 2 from Myotis chinensis, and 1 from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) belonged to ToxoDB#9 (http://toxodb.org/toxo/). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed an overall T. gondii prevalence of 6.1% in bats from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces in China, and reported two T. gondii genotypes (ToxoDB#9 and #10) having a wide geographical distribution in China. These results provide new genetic information about T. gondii infection in bats, and have implications for better understanding of the genetic diversity of T. gondii in China and elsewhere.","publish_time":"2014-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, Si-Yuan; Cong, Wei; Liu, Ye; Li, Nan; Wang, Ze-Dong; Zhang, Fu-Kai; Huang, Si-Yang; Zhu, Xing-Quan; Liu, Quan","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be314554a535360c674f8666efdefd43e38e5ccc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4258805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465220/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-014-0558-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Murina","Rhinolophus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["gondii infection","bats","China","gondii prevalence","Toxoplasma gondii","gondii genotypes","positive samples","Jiangxi","Liaoning","Guangdong provinces","Jilin","ToxoDB","positive DNA samples","genetic diversity","genetic characterization","genetic markers","new genetic information","nested PCR","PCR-RFLP","present study","Murina leucogaster","RESULTS","Limited information","alternative SAG2","wide geographical distribution","wide variety of warm-blooded hosts","multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism","GRA6","BTUB","SAG3","intracellular protozoan parasite","PK1","L358","Apico","implications","Myotis chinensis","better understanding","liver tissues","c22","detection","species","Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","Cynopterus sphinx","c29","humans","B1 gene","BACKGROUND","total","SAG1","objective","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as being from a measurably evolving population. Here we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in molecular sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conduct extensive simulations under a range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behaviour of this classification in analyses of five data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, and coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, and ancient DNA data sets of Hepatitis B virus and of mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other measures of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses.","publish_time":"2019-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duchene, Sebastian; Lemey, Philippe; Stadler, Tanja; Ho, Simon YW; Duchene, David A; Dhanasekaran, Vijaykrishna; Baele, Guy","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/810697","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BETS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sampling times of molecular sequence data","molecular clock","BETS","molecular evolution","ancient DNA data sets of Hepatitis B virus","ancient DNA samples","measures of temporal signal","Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal","modern samples","sampling time window","entire model","time scales","evolving pathogens","key advantage","key aspect","evolving population","essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses","H1N1 influenza virus","mammalian hosts","bacterium Bordetella pertussis","coronaviruses","tree prior","estimation of substitution rates","coherent assessment","effective alternative","mitochondrial genomes of dog species","range of conditions","classification","lineage rate variation","extensive simulations","calibrations","fit","Phylogenetic methods","behaviour","performance","models","results"],"language":"en"},

No other carnivore shows such diversity of adaptation, being found in a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from arctic tundra to tropical rainforests. Mustelids have retained many primitive characteristics, which include relatively small size, short stocky legs, five toes per foot, elongated braincase, and short rostrum (Anderson, 1989). The Mustelinae is the central subfamily of the Mustelidae. The best-known members of the Mustelinae are the weasels, mink, ferrets (genus Mustela), and the martens (genus Martes) (Anderson, 1989). The genus Mustela is divided into five subgenera: Mustela (weasels), Lutreola (European mink), Vison (American mink), Putorius (ferrets), and Grammogale (South American weasels). The smallest member of the Mustelidae family is the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), which weighs as little as 25g, and the largest member is the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), which can weigh as much as 45kg (Nowak, 1999).","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mayer, Joerg; Marini, Robert P.; Fox, James G.","journal":"Laboratory Animal Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e6bcd2b28de3f1c2f1ea8dda2830c540bd9d9b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149530.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124095274000146; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095274000146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nowak","Mustelids"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","South America"],"keyphrases":["genus Mustela","Mustelidae family","Ferrets","Mustela nivalis","Mustela putorius furo","ancient family Mustelidae","American mink","South American weasels","European mink","genus Martes","Anderson","Mustelinae","Nowak","short rostrum","largest member","central subfamily","smallest member","short stocky legs","toes","foot","Vison","arctic tundra","small size","elongated braincase","sea otter","North","Lutreola","martens","Grammogale","wide variety of ecosystems","Eurasia","subgenera","primitive characteristics","tropical rainforests","Enhydra lutris","Africa","taxonomic groups","diversity of adaptation","best-known members","Eocene period","years","carnivore","Mustelids","species"],"language":"en"},

Recently, Ste24 was shown to also cleave nonprenylated substrates. Reduced activity of the human ortholog, HsSte24, is linked to multiple disease states (laminopathies), including progerias and lipid disorders. Ste24 possesses a unique \u201C\u03B1\u2010barrel\u201D structure consisting of seven transmembrane (TM) \u03B1\u2010helices encircling a large intramembranous cavity (~14 000 \u00C5(3)).

This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Universal health coverage (UHC) means inclusion and empowerment for all people to access medical care, including treatment and prevention services. UHC exists in all the industrial nations except the US, which has a mixed public-private system and struggles with closing the gap between the insured and the uninsured population. Middle- and low-income countries face many challenges for UHC achievement, including low levels of funding, lack of personnel, weak health management, and issues of availability of services favoring middle- and upper-class communities. Community health services for preventive and curative health services for needs in populations at risk for poor health in low-income countries must be addressed with proactive health promotion initiatives for the double burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Each nation will develop its own unique approach to national health systems, but there are models used by a number of countries based on principles of national responsibility for health, social solidarity for providing funding, and for effective ways of providing care with comprehensiveness, efficiency, quality, and cost containment. Universal access does not eliminate social inequalities in health by itself, including a wide context of reducing social inequities. Understanding national health systems requires examining representative models of different systems. Health reform is necessarily a continuing process as all countries must adapt to face challenges of cost constraints, inequalities in access to care, aging populations, emergence of new disease conditions and advancing technology including the growing capacity of medicine, public health and health promotion. The growing stress of increasing obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, requires nations to modify their health care systems. Learning from the systems developed in different countries helps to learn from the processes of change in other countries.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.","journal":"Case Studies in Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb0b9614a0022fcf820750b84e94d6eb16ff369c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149836.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128045718000317; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128045718000317","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations Member States","Universal Health Coverage","UHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health","health care systems","poor health","Health reform","national health systems","curative health services","Community health services","Universal Health Coverage","quality essential health care services","weak health management","proactive health promotion initiatives","low-income countries","Universal access","different countries","number of countries","prevention services","medical care","social inequalities","representative models of different systems","UHC achievement","social solidarity","industrial nations","social inequities","Middle","principles of national responsibility","challenges of cost constraints","aging populations","effective ways","United Nations Member States","noncommunicable diseases","chronic diseases","cost containment","affordable essential medicines","low levels of funding","growing capacity of medicine","financial risk protection","mixed public-private system","growing stress of increasing obesity","needs","double burden of infectious","lack of personnel","technology","SDGs","emergence of new disease conditions","diabetes","issues of availability","struggles","efficiency","comprehensiveness","inclusion","unique approach","gap","Sustainable Development Goals","empowerment","people","vaccines","treatment","continuing process","wide context","upper-class communities","uninsured population","processes of change","Learning"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we performed a systematic interaction analysis of DC\u2010SIGN and its related receptors, DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related protein (DC\u2010SIGNR) and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C\u2010type lectin (LSECtin) using frontal affinity chromatography (FAC). Carbohydrate\u2010recognition domains of the lectins, expressed as Fc\u2013fusion chimeras, were immobilized to Protein A\u2013Sepharose and subjected to quantitative FAC analysis using 157 pyridylaminated glycans. Both DC\u2010SIGN\u2013Fc and DC\u2010SIGNR\u2013Fc showed similar specificities for glycans containing terminal mannose and fucose, but great difference in affinity under the given experimental conditions. By contrast, LSECtin\u2013Fc showed no affinity to these glycans. As a common feature, the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectin\u2013Fc chimeras, including LSECtin, exhibited binding affinity to mono\u2010 and/or bi\u2010antennary agalactosylated N\u2010glycans. The detailed FAC analysis further implied that the presence of terminal GlcNAc at the N\u2010acetylglucosaminyltransferase I position is a key determinant for the binding of these lectins to agalactosylated N\u2010glycans. By contrast, none of the lectins showed significant affinity to highly branched agalactosylated N\u2010glycans. All of the lectins expressed on the cells were able to mediate cellular adhesion to agalactosylated cells and endocytosis of a model glycoprotein, agalactosylated \u03B11\u2010acid glycoprotein.

We also describe how these processes may be disrupted in systemic infections, with a particular emphasis on mouse models of sepsis. Neutrophils are often immobilized in the lungs and liver during systemic infections, and this immobilization may be a mechanism through which bacteria can evade the innate immune response or allow neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps that trap and kill bacteria in blood. The platelet is also an important player in sepsis, and we describe how it collaborates with neutrophils in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

All sera tested contained Ab to cryptic FAH epitopes according with results from western-blot tests, whereas ELISA data indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoantigen (autoAg). Such differences were detected in individual sera from various mouse strains, and were ascribed to the fact that proteins insolubilized on solid supports expose a variety of conformational and cryptic antigenic determinants. On the other hand, whereas results from both experimental protocols showed that anti-MHV Ab did not cross-react with the soluble autoAg, the opposite situation did not show analogous results. Thus, binding of autoAb to insolubilized FAH could be inhibited by MHV depending on the mouse serum or the experimental protocol used. Additionally, a set of synthetic homologous peptides from mouse FAH and various viral proteins was employed to analyze the Ab repertoire of MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that two homologous peptides were recognized by most Ab: the N-terminal sequences (1\u201310) from FAH and the nucleocapside, both sharing 50% of identity, and sequence 2317\u20132326 of the RNA polymerase, a peptide showing 30% of identity with FAH 11\u201320. Results indicated that MHV-infection triggers at least three distinct Ab populations: anti-MHV, anti-FAH and cross-reacting Ab. This cross-reaction implies either sequential or conformational epitopes from both the viral proteins and the autoAg and may differ between individuals.","publish_time":"2004-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathieu, Patricia A.; G\u00F3mez, Karina A.; Coutelier, Jean-Paul; Retegui, Lilia A.","journal":"J Autoimmun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58537f9ff98ac9e146885f38c33e246de8dc0ece.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127313.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841104000575; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841104000575","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FAH","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse FAH","anti-FAH","anti-MHV Ab","Ab repertoire of MHV","cryptic FAH epitopes","contained Ab","analogous results","MHV-infection triggers","conformational epitopes","mouse serum","distinct Ab populations","various mouse strains","various viral proteins","native epitopes","mouse hepatitis virus","individual sera","soluble autoAg","infected mice","identity","western-blot tests","variety of conformational","set of synthetic homologous peptides","experimental protocols","western-blot competition assays","ELISA data","binding of autoAb","cryptic antigenic determinants","solid supports","opposite situation","liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase","cross-reaction","features of autoantibodies","fact","N-terminal sequences","autoantigen","RNA polymerase","differences","hand","individuals","nucleocapside"],"language":"en"},

The setting was an emergency room (ER) in a large tertiary hospital and included primary and secondary MERS patients. Methods Rapid response teams conducted repeated assessments of IPC and monitored implementation of corrective measures using a detailed structured checklist. We ascertained the epidemiologic link between patients and calculated the secondary attack rate per 10,000 patients visiting the ER (SAR/10,000) in 3 phases of the outbreak. Results In phase I, 6 primary cases gave rise to 48 secondary cases over 4 generations, including a case that resulted in 9 cases in the first generation of secondary cases and 21 cases over a chain of 4 generations. During the second and third phases, the number of secondary cases sharply dropped to 18 cases and 1 case, respectively, from a comparable number of primary cases. The SAR/10,000 dropped from 75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55-99) in phase I to 29 (95% CI, 17-46) and 3 (95% CI, 0-17) in phases II and III, respectively. Conclusions The study demonstrated salient evidence that proper institution of IPC measures during management of an outbreak of MERS could remarkably change the course of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Bushra, Hassan E.; Al Arbash, Hussain A.; Mohammed, Mutaz; Abdalla, Osman; Abdallah, Mohamed N.; Al-Mayahi, Zayid K.; Assiri, Abdallah M.; BinSaeed, Abdulaziz A.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/447d470180f96efea97552434d3b470a82c1772a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132728.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2016.12.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189413/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655317300032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655317300032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAR","IPC"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["number of secondary cases","generation of secondary cases","secondary MERS patients","comparable number of primary cases","outbreak of MERS","phases","CI","secondary attack rate","proper institution of IPC measures","implementation of corrective measures","large tertiary hospital","generations","SAR","repeated assessments of IPC","outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome","impact of implementation","retrospective cohort study","salient evidence","different levels of infection prevention","control","management","Methods Rapid response teams","detailed structured checklist","Saudi Arabia","rise","emergency room","objective","setting","Conclusions","chain","epidemiologic link","confidence interval","Results","course"],"language":"en"},

Near-patient assays allow establishment of the diagnosis within minutes in young children, and this study aimed to evaluate near-patient assays in relation to the patient\u2019s age. A total of 194 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A/H3N2 virus infection, diagnosed within a prospective cohort study, were included. Cryopreserved nasopharyngeal swabs collected from these patients were tested by four near-patient assays (Binax Now Influenza A\u0026B, Quick S-Influ A/B, Influ-A\u0026B Respi-Strip, and Actim Influenza A\u0026B). The main outcome measure was sensitivity of the near-patient assays in relation to the age of patients. The Binax Now, Quick S-Influ, Influ-A\u0026B Respi-Strip and Actim assays had overall sensitivities of 19%, 18%, 26%, and 40%, respectively. The estimated sensitivity for influenza A/H3N2 virus detection in nasopharyngeal swabs was 17\u201356% in children 1 year of age and decreased to 8\u201322% in patients 80 years of age (logistic regression). The sensitivity of the Influ-A\u0026B Respi-Strip and Actim assays decreased significantly with increasing age (p 0.014 and p 0.033, respectively (logistic regression)), a trend for decrease was observed for the Binax Now assay (p 0.074 (logistic regression)), and the low sensitivity of the Quick S-Influ assay was similar in children and adults. Less than one-fourth of diagnosed influenza A/H3N2 virus infections can be identified in elderly patients using a near-patient assay. Consequently, near-patient assays are of limited value for confirming the diagnosis when influenza is clinically suspected in adults. Antiviral therapy and additional diagnostic procedures cannot be withheld on the basis of a negative near-patient assay result, particularly in adult patients.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steininger, C.; Redlberger, M.; Graninger, W.; Kundi, M.; Popow-Kraupp, T.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15998c56cbc9d5def9fed655e7b0263f97fbddf5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/76916afc72974a191984623ac434496844213305.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128506.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14621467; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14621467; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.02674.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19183404/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","Actim Influenza A\u0026B","Influ-A\u0026B","Quick S-Influ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["near-patient assays","age of patients","Actim Influenza","Actim assays","diagnosed influenza","negative near-patient assay result","B Respi-Strip","Quick S-Influ assay","elderly patients","adult patients","reliable diagnosis of influenza","effective patient management","identification of contagious patients","increasing age","years of age","patient\u2019s age","year of age","Binax","logistic regression","low sensitivity","estimated sensitivity","H3N2 virus infections","H3N2 virus detection","relation","young children","adults","Cryopreserved nasopharyngeal swabs","prospective cohort study","additional diagnostic procedures","limited value","Antiviral therapy","minutes","basis","overall sensitivities","laboratory","establishment","main outcome measure","trend","decrease","total"],"language":"en"},

The transmembrane molecule CD13 is expressed on monocytes and endothelial cells and has been shown to mediate homotypic cell adhesion, which may imply a role for CD13 in inflammatory monocyte trafficking. Here, we show that ligation and clustering of CD13 by mAb or viral ligands potently induce myeloid cell/endothelial adhesion in a signal transduction-dependent manner involving monocytic cytoskeletal rearrangement and filopodia formation. Treatment with soluble recombinant (r)CD13 blocks this CD13-dependent adhesion, and CD13 molecules from monocytic and endothelial cells are present in the same immunocomplex, suggesting a direct participation of CD13 in the adhesive interaction. This concept is strengthened by the fact that activated monocytic cells adhere to immobilized recombinant CD13. Furthermore, treatment with anti-CD13 antibodies in a murine model of peritonitis results in a decrease in leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneum, suggesting a potential role for CD13 in leukocyte trafficking in vivo. Therefore, this work supports a new direction for CD13 biology, where these cell surface molecules act as true molecular interfaces that induce and participate in critical inflammatory cell interactions.","publish_time":"2008-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mina-Osorio, Paola; Winnicka, Beata; O\u0027Conor, Catherine; Grant, Christina L.; Vogel, Lotte K.; Rodriguez-Pinto, Daniel; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Ortega, Enrique; Shapiro, Linda H.","journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2493070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.1107802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18495788/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493070/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD13 molecules","recombinant CD13","CD13-dependent adhesion","CD13 biology","clustering of CD13","endothelial adhesion","anti-CD13 antibodies","direct participation of CD13","transmembrane molecule CD13","endothelial cells","cell surface adhesion molecules","homotypic cell adhesion","cell surface molecules","myeloid cell","activated monocytic cells","critical inflammatory cell interactions","leukocyte trafficking","Treatment","monocytic cytoskeletal rearrangement","inflammatory monocyte trafficking","potential role","leukocyte infiltration","soluble recombinant","signal transduction-dependent manner","murine model of peritonitis results","decrease","mAb","viral ligands","migration of circulating leukocytes","peritoneum","true molecular interfaces","monocytes","filopodia formation","blood vessels","immunocomplex","new direction","fact","inflammation","adhesive interaction","work","ligation","site of injury","concept"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded the scientific articles published worldwide by analysing international collaborations and the knowledge landscape through time, as well as research topics and country involvement. METHODOLOGY: We searched the Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and PubMed for studies published up to 31st December 2018 on Zika using the search terms \u201Czika\u201D, \u201Czkv\u201D or \u201Czikv\u201D. We analysed the scientific production regarding which countries have published the most, on which topics, as well as country level collaboration. We performed a scientometric analysis of research on Zika focusing on knowledge mapping and the scientific research path over time and space. FINDINGS: We found two well defined research areas divided into three subtopics accounting for six clusters. With regard to country analysis, the USA and Brazil were the countries with the highest numbers of publications on Zika. China entered as a new player focusing on specific research areas. When we took into consideration the epidemics and reported cases, Brazil and France were the leading research countries on related topics. As for international collaboration, the USA followed by England and France stand out as the main hubs. The research areas most published included public health-related topics from 2015 until the very beginning of 2016, followed by an increase in topics related to the clinical aspects of the disease in 2016 and the emergence of laboratory research in 2017/2018. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping the response to Zika, a public health emergency, demonstrated a clear pattern of the participation of countries in the scientific advances. The pattern of knowledge production found in this study represented varying country perspectives, research capacity and interests based first on their level of exposure to the epidemic and second on their financial positions regarding science.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Oliveira, Juliane Fonseca; Pescarini, Julia Moreira; Rodrigues, Moreno de Souza; Almeida, Bethania de Araujo; Henriques, Claudio Maierovitch Pessanha; Gouveia, Fabio Castro; Rabello, Elaine Teixeira; Matta, Gustavo Correa; Barreto, Mauricio L.; Sampaio, Ricardo Barros","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f166fe3773162e6be514761c97e80943c6f598f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7067462.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32163439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Brazil","China","France","England"],"keyphrases":["research topics","field of research","research capacity","scientific research path","leading research countries","defined research areas","specific research areas","scientometric analysis of research","emergence of laboratory research","Zika epidemic","construction of scientific knowledge","knowledge mapping","scientific production","different knowledge areas","knowledge landscape","scientific articles","country analysis","pattern of knowledge production","public health-related topics","scientific advances","country level collaboration","participation of countries","country involvement","Science studies","Brazil","France","varying country perspectives","USA","time","study","Web of Science","public health emergency","clear pattern","international collaborations","level of exposure","reported cases","new player","interests","subtopics accounting","highest numbers of publications","epidemics","WoS","Scopus","practice","response","space","clinical aspects","search terms","disease","consideration","PubMed","zkv","financial positions","England","regard","dissemination","clusters","China","main hubs","increase","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","zikv","FINDINGS","beginning"],"language":"en"},

Of course there are signs of it, the scientists can predict, alarming speeches can be made. But there are always alarmist people around, maybe that is why sometimes even the most serious warnings may be not considered by the authorities on time. The first patients may be lost without a proper diagnosis. When everybody realizes that there may be a big problem in the horizon, sometimes it is too late. That is why it is very important to monitor contagious diseases and follow the warnings and releases of national and international disease control centers and other related organizations. China celebrated Lunar New Year with more than 40 thousand families on the 18 of January 2020. Nobody seem to be expecting this emerging new viral pneumonia outbreak appeared in Wuhan, in the last days of 2019, will break the chains and turn out to be a pandemic! But maybe this time it was not too late. There were four important pandemics within the last century: Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, Asian Flu and Swine Flu. Each left different story behind. Millions of people had infected, hundreds, thousands of people died. This time, the Modern World had different tools to limit the SARS CoV2 outbreak. The national and international institutions of our globe were all communicating and taking precautions in a very fast manner than ever. However, this time, unexpectedly, the SARS-CoV-2 contagion was also faster. Besides the international organizations like WHO, UNESCO and UNICEF, the roles of local authorities, health ministries, disease control centers, health protection agencies, research centers and universities are all very important in different operational levels to control and survive from the pandemic. This paper will review the immediate response of different national and international institutions and authorities to COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"KO\u00C7AK TUFAN, Zeliha; KAYAASLAN, Bircan","journal":"Turk J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30ccb3f93b8946e1b610a9a9b762ce8f6cc2e099.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299201/; https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2004-167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Modern World","UNESCO","UNICEF"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["time","international disease control centers","international institutions","international organizations","Asian Flu","Spanish Flu","Swine Flu","different tools","immediate response of different national","Hong Kong Flu","research centers","releases of national","different operational levels","left different story","thousands of people","important pandemics","Millions of people","alarmist people","roles of local authorities","SARS CoV2 outbreak","health ministries","related organizations","SARS-CoV","serious warnings","emerging new viral pneumonia outbreak","health protection agencies","Lunar New Year","century","universities","Wuhan","UNICEF","hundreds","UNESCO","Modern World","globe","COVID","contagious diseases","scientists","precautions","horizon","China","alarming speeches","fast manner","big problem","paper","contagion","proper diagnosis","patients","signs","families","days","chains"],"language":"en"},

Here, we identified a conserved herpesviral tegument protein known as pUL48 of HCMV, encoding deubiquitinase enzyme, as having a key role in carcinogenesis. We show using deubiquitinase sufficient- and deficient-HCMV that HCMV deubiquitinase is a key in inducing enhanced cellular metabolic activity through upregulation of several anti-apoptotic genes and downregulation of several pro-apoptotic genes expression. Furthermore, HCMV deubiquitinase acquires pro-tumor functions by inhibiting PRR-mediated type I interferon via deubiquitination of TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 and STING. Taken together, our results suggest that HCMV infection may promote oncogenesis by inhibiting innate immunity of the host.","publish_time":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumari, Puja; Saha, Irene; Narayanan, Athira; Narayanan, Sathish; Takaoka, Akinori; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Tailor, Prafullakumar; Kumar, Himanshu","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a2f058d14f4b6db1e7191a2ed2634d5c5699455.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5680583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28981114/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2017.461","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV deubiquitinase","pUL48 of HCMV","deficient-HCMV","HCMV infection","deubiquitinase enzyme","deubiquitinase sufficient","key role","pro-apoptotic genes expression","anti-apoptotic genes","virus-mediated carcinogenesis","cancer of different tissue origin","pro-tumor functions","PRR-mediated type","upregulation","downregulation","TRAF3","deubiquitination of TRAF6","interferon","enhanced cellular metabolic activity","IRAK1","multifactorial disease","conserved herpesviral tegument protein","IRF7","oncogenesis","innate immunity","STING","herpesvirus","crucial factors","Human cytomegalovirus","host","results","components"],"language":"en"},

Objectives Evaluation of a diagnostic approach including multiplex PCR assays for revisiting the epidemiology and etiology of CAP in children at hospital. Study design Children of all ages consulting at the Emergency Department of the University hospital of Saint-Etienne, France, during the 2012\u20132013 winter period were included. In addition to bacterial cultures, the following pathogens were detected using biplex commercially-available rt-PCR tests: adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. Results From 85 patients with CAP, at least one pathogen was identified in 81 cases (95.3%), including 4 bacterial exclusive infections (4.7%), 53 viral exclusive infections (62.4%) and 24 mixed infections (28.2%). Coinfection by at least two viruses was observed in 37 cases (43.5%). Mean age was higher in the case of documented bacterial infection (P \u003C0.05). In the subgroup of viral exclusive infection, the mean age of severe cases was 2.0 years vs 3.8 years in mild and moderate cases (P \u003C0.05). Conclusions These findings highlight the huge proportion of CAP of viral origin, the high number of co-infection by multiple viruses and the low number of bacterial CAP, notably in children under 5 years, and address the need to re-evaluate the indications of empiric antimicrobial treatment in this age group.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cantais, Aymeric; Mory, Olivier; Pillet, Sylvie; Verhoeven, Paul O.; Bonneau, Julie; Patural, Hugues; Pozzetto, Bruno","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d95aa29fa61c9fd4ee5f7bc29fca44d9e124c517.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106426.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214001838; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214001838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915939/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chlamydophila"],"organizations":["the Emergency Department"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["bacterial exclusive infections","low number of bacterial CAP","etiology of CAP","viral exclusive infections","parainfluenza viruses","multiple viruses","mean age of severe cases","subgroup of viral exclusive infection","management of children","bacterial cultures","moderate cases","huge proportion of CAP","case of documented bacterial infection","viral origin","years vs","age group","Study design Children","mixed infections","high number of co-infection","diagnostic approach","available rt-PCR tests","following pathogens","Chlamydophila pneumonia","development of new molecular diagnostic tests","multiplex PCR assays","University hospital of Saint-Etienne","wide range of pathogens","adenovirus","respiratory syncytial virus","bocavirus","human metapneumovirus","rhinovirus","ages consulting","enterovirus","coronavirus","simultaneous detection","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","epidemiology","Emergency Department","indications of empiric antimicrobial treatment","biplex","community","findings","Objectives Evaluation","Abstract Background","Conclusions","France","need","addition","patients","Results","winter period","Coinfection"],"language":"en"},

Diarrheic disease was observed in newborn calves aged 4\u201315days, with high morbidity and mortality rates, but no diarrhea was seen in adult animals. Rotavirus antigen was detected by enzyme-immunoassay in the intestinal content or the fecal samples of all examined animals. Besides RVA, bovine coronavirus and bovine enteric calicivirus were detected in some samples. Selected RVA strains were characterized by whole genome sequencing. Two strains, RVA/Cow-wt/TUR/Amasya-1/2015/G8P[5] and RVA/Cow-wt/TUR/Amasya-2/2015/G8P[5] were genotyped as G8-P[5]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 and showed \u003E99% nucleotide sequence identity among themselves. This genomic constellation is fairly common among bovine RVA strains; however, phylogenetic analysis of the G8 VP7 gene showed close genetic relationship to some European human RVA strains (up to 98.4% nt identity). Our findings is the first indication regarding the circulation of G8 RVA strains in Turkey. Given that the administered RVA vaccines contained type G6 and G10 VP7 antigens some concerns raised with regard to the level of heterotypic protection elicited by the vaccine strains against circulating bovine G8 RVA strains.

The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (multiplex-PCR) can detect dozens of pathogens simultaneously, greatly reducing turnaround time (TAT) and improving detection sensitivity. But as a double-edged sword, due to the high sensitivity of PCR, the type of respiratory specimens is critical to diagnosis. In this work, we performed a head-to-head comparison to evaluate the multiplex-PCR yields between two samples, sputum and flocked oropharyngeal swabs (OPS). METHODS: Eleven common respiratory pathogens were tested in hospitalized children\u003C 13 years of age who met the criteria for lower respiratory tract infection by GeXP-based multiplex-PCR of paired OPS and sputum. RESULTS: From January to June 2018, 440 children with paired OPS and sputum were tested. The positive rate was 84% (369/440) for OPS and 88% (386/440) for sputum (p = .007). The frequency of detection of HRV, RSV, Influenza A virus, HMPV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, M. pneumoniae, coronavirus, bocavirus and C. pneumoniae in sputa was higher than that of OPSs (all p \u003C .001). Both types of specimens had similarly very good kappa values for most of pathogens, except for Mycoplasma pneumonia (\u03BA = 0.61) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (\u03BA = 0.24). Additionally, 79.3% (349/440) of cases showed consistent results between the two types of samples, and they were significantly younger than patients with inconsistent results (p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Flocked oropharyngeal swabs and sputum performed similarly for the detection of common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children by multiplex-PCR, except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Young patients are likely to have consistent results between the two specimens.

Methods Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort (ODC) which includes a 20% random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015-December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Results Persons who had an overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Conclusion Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slaunwhite, Amanda Kathleen; Gan, Wen Qi; Xavier, Chloe; Zhao, Bin; A Buxton, Jane; Desai, Roshni","journal":"Drug Alcohol Depend","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3203f42a3fc0112d8e779a09d453b0747c98ef76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206446.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037687162030212X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037687162030212X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BC Provincial Overdose Cohort"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overdose history","history of overdose","BC Provincial Overdose Cohort","Results Persons","Conclusion Persons","previous non-fatal overdose event","development of severe illness","known chronic conditions","prevalence of known risk factors","chronic pulmonary disease","public health emergencies of COVID","random sample of BC residents","health inequities","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","coronary heart disease","mortality","diabetes","logistic regression","British Columbia","ODC","significant efforts","Abstract Background","Chi-square tests","Canada","increased likelihood","Methods Data","study","purpose","comparison"],"language":"en"},

Climate change-related reductions in land productivity and habitability and in food and water security can also interact with demographic, economic and social factors to increase migration. In addition to migration, climate change has also implications for travel and the risk of disease. This article discusses the impact of climate change on migration and travel with implications for public health practice. Methods: Literature review. Results: Migrants may be at increased risk of communicable and non-communicable diseases, due to factors in their country of origin and their country of destination or conditions that they experience during migration. Although migration has not been a significant driver of communicable disease outbreaks to date, public health authorities need to ensure that effective screening and vaccination programmes for priority communicable diseases are in place. Population growth coupled with socio-economic development is increasing travel and tourism, and advances in technology have increased global connectivity and reduced the time required to cover long distances. At the same time, as a result of climate change, many temperate regions, including high-income countries, are now suitable for vector-borne disease transmission. This is providing opportunities for importation of vectors and pathogens from endemic areas that can lead to cases or outbreaks of communicable diseases with which health professionals may be unfamiliar. Conclusion: Health systems need to be prepared for the potential population health consequences of migration, travel and tourism and the impact of climate change on these. Integrated surveillance, early detection of cases and other public health interventions are critical to protect population health and prevent and control communicabledisease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Semenza, Jan C; Ebi, Kristie L","journal":"J Travel Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6e2e59200b21d30c65dcea2b5076aa64a0c7b9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107585.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976790/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taz026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of climate change","result of climate change","travel","health professionals","climate events","Health systems","potential population health consequences of migration","Climate change-related reductions","outbreaks of communicable diseases","public health authorities","public health interventions","public health practice","priority communicable diseases","non-communicable diseases","increased risk of communicable","significant driver of communicable disease outbreaks","risk of disease","Population growth","population displacement","tourism","implications","disease transmission","time","control communicabledisease outbreaks","social factors","country of origin","country of destination","early detection of cases","habitability","date","land productivity","effective screening","vaccination programmes","intensity of extreme weather","temperate regions","pathogens","droughts","frequency","food","demographic","advances","socio-economic development","importation of vectors","high-income countries","endemic areas","heavy precipitation","water security","duration","global connectivity","technology","Integrated surveillance","sea level rise","ambient temperature","opportunities","Migrants","conditions","article","addition","Methods","Literature review","long distances","Results","Conclusion","Background"],"language":"en"},

Cases of H7N9 human infections emerged in eastern China in 2013 and immediately raised pandemic concerns as historically, pandemics were caused by the introduction of new subtypes into immunologically na\u00EFve human populations. Highly pathogenic H7N9 cases with severe disease were reported recently, indicating the continuing public health threat and the need for a prophylactic vaccine. Here we review the development of recombinant influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) as vaccines against H7N9 virus. Several approaches to vaccine development are reviewed including the expression of VLPs in mammalian, plant and insect cell expression systems. Although considerable progress has been achieved, including demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs in the human clinical trials, the remaining challenges need to be addressed. These challenges include improvements to the manufacturing processes, as well as enhancements to immunogenicity in order to elicit protective immunity to multiple variants and subtypes of influenza virus.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pushko, Peter; Tretyakova, Irina","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397182/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050518","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 virus","immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs","subtypes of influenza virus","Cases of H7N9 human infections","expression of VLPs","development of recombinant influenza virus","pathogenic H7N9 cases","human clinical trials","na\u00EFve human populations","significant human mortality","pandemics","need","vaccine development","continuing public health threat","major threat","coronavirus pandemic","remaining challenges","pandemic concerns","prophylactic vaccine","introduction of new subtypes","insect cell expression systems","plant","multiple variants","protective immunity","mammalian","order","epidemics","particles","ongoing COVID","eastern China","manufacturing processes","enhancements","severe disease","potential","demonstration of safety","vaccines","improvements","midst","approaches"],"language":"en"},

However, the impact of exercise on the immune responses via toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, which recognizes the common viral genomic feature, single-stranded RNA, remains unclear. To clarify the effect of stressful exercise on immune function in response to viral infection, we measured the changes in the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, which are induced downstream from the TLR\u2013ligand interaction, in exhaustive-exercised mice immediately after treatment with the imidazoquinoline R-848, which can bind to and activate TLR7. Both exhaustive-exercised (EX) and non-exercised (N-EX) male C3H/HeN mice were injected with R-848 (5 mg kg(\u22121)), and blood samples were collected. In addition, RAW264 cells, which are mouse macrophage cells, were cultured 30 min after epinephrine (10 \u03BCM) or norepinephrine (10 \u03BCM) treatments, and were then stimulated with R-848 (10 \u03BCg ml(\u22121)). In addition, the effect of propranolol (10 mg kg(\u22121)) as blockade of \u03B2-adrenergic receptors on R-848-induced TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B1 production in the exercised mice was examined. Both the TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B1 concentrations in the plasma of EX were significantly lower than those in the plasma of N-EX after R-848 injection (P \u003C 0.05 and P \u003C 0.01, respectively), although the R-848 treatment increased the plasma TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B1 concentrations in both groups (P \u003C 0.01, respectively). The R-848-induced TNF-\u03B1 production in RAW264 cells was significantly inhibited by epinephrine and norepinephrine pre-treatment, although IFN-\u03B1 was not detected. The propranolol treatment completely inhibited exercise-induced TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B1 suppression in response to R-848 in the mice. These data suggest that EX induces a reduction in TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B1 production in response to R-848, and that these phenomena might be regulated by an exercise-induced elevation of the systemic catecholamines.","publish_time":"2010-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yano, Hiromi; Uchida, Masataka; Nakai, Ryosuke; Ishida, Kenji; Kato, Yasuko; Kawanishi, Noriaki; Shiva, Daisuke","journal":"Eur J Appl Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4004362149e51fc0039454f0b4f5344bf5cac850.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088253.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088253/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma TNF-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B1 production","IFN-\u03B1 concentrations","IFN-\u03B1 suppression","induced TNF-\u03B1 production","inhibited exercise-induced TNF-\u03B1","imidazoquinoline R","plasma of EX","exercise-induced elevation","N-EX","exhaustive-exercised mice","plasma of N","impact of exercise","effect of stressful exercise","Stressful exercise results","RAW264 cells","propranolol treatment","HeN mice","immune function","immune responses","\u03BCM","effect of propranolol","addition","temporary immune depression","mouse macrophage cells","plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor","viral infection","norepinephrine pre-treatment","common viral genomic feature","single-stranded RNA","male C3H","changes","toll","reduction","adrenergic receptors","ligand interaction","injection","groups","interferon","blockade of \u03B2","systemic catecholamines","treatments","data","blood samples","phenomena","\u03BCg","TLR7"],"language":"en"},

We found that, compared to seronegative controls, mice that were seropositive at least to Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and Mycoplasma pulmonis: (i) exhibited a higher interindividual variability in all the parameters quantifying metastatic progression; (ii) had elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines both before and at the end of the experiment; (iii) were more susceptible to hepatic metastasis. Interestingly, final levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and interleukin (IL)-18 correlated with the extent of hepatic colonization by the melanoma cells. To confirm the metastasis-enhancing effect of MHV and M. pulmonis we measured the ability of B16M cells to metastasize in pathogen-free animals housed for increasing time-intervals in the vicinity of MHV(\u002B) animals. Notably, susceptibility to metastasis was lower in animals seronegative to MHV than in MHV(\u002B) mice, whereas the latter were less susceptible to metastasis than MHV(\u002B) M. pulmonis(\u002B) mice. Seropositive animals had increased levels of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-18 suggesting that MHV and M. pulmonis enhance the metastatic ability of melanoma cells by inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines.

The likelihood of an encounter with patients infected by Ebola virus in subsaharan and West Africa, therefore, has increased during the last 2 years. The purpose of this short overview was to summarize the virology of the Ebola virus, transmission, epidemiology, clinical features, oral manifestations, treatment, and possible implications for maxillo-facial surgeons of EDV.","publish_time":"2016-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reichart, Peter A.; Gelderblom, Hans R.; Khongkhunthian, Pathawee; Schmidt-Westhausen, Andrea","journal":"Oral Maxillofac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/281ec9958e8955d1fce0e711bad72d1af61eec79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088354.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzI50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EDV"],"locations":["Europe","Africa","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["Ebola virus disease","maxillo-facial surgeons of EDV","facial burns","West Africa","patients","plastic surgeons","health care providers","public health organizations","oral manifestations","possible implications","Disease Control","major global health emergency","treatment","epidemiology","clinical features","transmission","USA","medical societies","cleft-lip","virology","subsaharan","EVD","palate","Prevention","Europe","encounter","short overview","Centers","risk of infection","outbreak","purpose","noma","likelihood","years"],"language":"en"},

This study adopts a public health ecology approach to systematically understand the relationship between urbanisation, urban environmental change and human health in China. METHOD: Remote sensing image analysis, based on night light data at five different time periods in recent decades, was used to determine changes to the overall urban area. Through a review of the evidence on the relationships between environmental health, urbanisation and health, we advance a pathway framework for explaining urban human health ecology. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation between disease prevalence and urbanisation level, adding a further dimension to a systemic understanding of urban health. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Urban areas have been increasing spatially, but unevenly, in recent decades, with medium and small cities also expanding rapidly in the past decade. Urbanisation and urban expansion result in changes to land use/coverage change, the urban environment and the residents\u2019 lifestyle, which result in human health problems. Regions with the highest urbanisation level were more inclined to have a high prevalence of chronic disease in recent decades. An ecological public health approach provides insights into the multiple types of data which need to be routinely collected if human disease is not to become a barrier to social and economic development.","publish_time":"2012-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xinhu; Wang, Cuiping; Zhang, Guoqin; Xiao, Lishan; Dixon, Jane","journal":"Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd9d628f28e666b72ff3c2a99c5b412ea6bb9e12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzEwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["environmental health","urban human health ecology","systemic understanding of urban health","Urban areas","human health problems","health effects of rapid urban environmental change","urban expansion result","urban spatial expansion","public health ecology approach","ecological public health approach","overall urban area","urbanisation gradient","human disease","highest urbanisation level","recent decades","disease prevalence","coverage change","changes","high prevalence of chronic disease","different points","different time periods","night light data","multiple types of data","Spearman rank correlation coefficient","insights","land use","little attention","Remote sensing image analysis","pathway framework","dynamism","dimension","relationships","Current studies","residents\u2019 lifestyle","SCOPE","METHOD","barrier","small cities","evidence","study","China","economic development","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","Regions","BACKGROUND","review","past decade"],"language":"en"},

The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection, the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and complement the main results.

Nasal swabs from 1113 dromedary camels (39 farms) and 34 sheep (1 farm) and sputum samples from 2 MERS-CoV-infected camel farm owners and 1 MERS-CoV-infected sheep farm owner were collected. Samples from camels and humans underwent real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR screening to detect MERS-CoV. In addition, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partially characterized MERS-CoV genome fragments obtained from camels were performed. Among the 40 farms, 6 camel farms were positive for MERS-CoV; the virus was not detected in the single sheep farm. The maximum duration of viral shedding from infected camels was 2 weeks after the first positive test result as detected in nasal swabs and in rectal swabs obtained from infected calves. Three partial camel sequences characterized in this study (open reading frames 1a and 1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and ORF4b) together with the corresponding regions of previously reported MERS-CoV sequence obtained from one farm owner were clustering together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster containing human and camel isolates reported for the Arabian Peninsula. Data provided further evidence of the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV infection and strongly suggested that camels may have a role in the transmission of the virus to humans.","publish_time":"2016-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muhairi, Salama Al; Hosani, Farida Al; Eltahir, Yassir M.; Mulla, Mariam Al; Yusof, Mohammed F.; Serhan, Wissam S.; Hashem, Farouq M.; Elsayed, Elsaeid A.; Marzoug, Bahaaeldin A.; Abdelazim, Assem S.","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8312a5139605d32ac6f271ffa8b804d75d47d954.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089110.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089110/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abu Dhabi"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","reported MERS-CoV sequence","infected camels","larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster","characterized MERS-CoV genome fragments","infected camel farm owners","zoonotic potential of MERS","dromedary camel farms","infected sheep farm owner","dromedary camels","camel isolates","humans","single sheep farm","partial camel sequences","infected calves","Nasal swabs","rectal swabs","infections","sputum samples","positive test result","real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR screening","prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","study","weeks","phylogenetic analysis","maximum duration of viral shedding","relationship","corresponding regions","ORF4b","open reading frames","sequencing","evidence","Emirate of Abu Dhabi","Spike1","Spike2","addition","Arabian Peninsula","transmission","role","research","Data","objective"],"language":"en"},

Based on findings from the 2009 A H1N1 pandemic in the National Capital Region (NCR), this paper presents a recovery analysis for workforce disruptions using economic input\u2013output modeling. The model formulation takes into consideration the dynamic interdependencies across sectors in an economic system in addition to the inherent characteristics of the economic sectors. From a macroeconomic perspective, the risk of the influenza disaster can be modeled using two risk metrics. First, there is the level of inoperability, which represents the percentage difference between the ideal production level and the degraded production level. Second, the economic loss metric represents the financial value associated with the reduced output. The contribution of this work revolves around the modeling of uncertainties triggered by new perturbations to interdependent economic sectors within an influenza pandemic timeline. We model the level of inoperability of economic sectors throughout their recovery horizon from the initial outbreak of the disaster using a dynamic model. Moreover, we use the level of inoperability values to quantify the cumulative economic losses incurred by the sectors within the recovery horizon. Finally, we revisit the 2009 NCR pandemic scenario to demonstrate the use of uncertainty analysis in modeling the inoperability and economic loss behaviors due to time-varying perturbations and their associated ripple effects to interdependent economic sectors.","publish_time":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Haimar, Amine; Santos, Joost R.","journal":"Nat Hazards (Dordr)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/983ab625e029ff72163fbccc13345e6f6b18453f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089399.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089399/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Capital Region","NCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interdependent economic sectors","various economic sectors","economic system","economic input","major economic losses","cumulative economic losses","economic loss behaviors","economic loss metric","level of inoperability values","ideal production level","degraded production level","recovery analysis","recovery horizon","output modeling","dynamic model","H1N1 pandemic","influenza pandemic timeline","NCR pandemic scenario","influenza disaster","modeling of uncertainties","model formulation","use of uncertainty analysis","new perturbations","dynamic interdependencies","reduced output","risk metrics","time-varying perturbations","associated ripple effects","workforce disruptions","financial value","adverse consequences","National Capital Region","inherent characteristics","paper","consideration","percentage difference","addition","initial outbreak","pandemics","Outbreaks of infectious diseases","macroeconomic perspective","findings","contribution"],"language":"en"},

Polyethylenimine (PEI) is among the most efficient nonviral gene delivery vectors. Its efficiency and cytotoxicity depend on molecular weight, with the 25-kDa PEI being most efficient but cytotoxic. Smaller PEIs are noncytotoxic but less efficient. Enhancement in gene delivery efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity by cross-linking of small PEIs via potentially biodegradable linkages was explored herein. The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycation\u2019s effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity. Toward this goal, we carried out cross-linking of branched 2-kDa PEI and its 1:1 (w/w) mixture with a linear 423-Da PEI via ester- and/or amide-bearing linkages; the in vitro and in vivo gene delivery efficiency, as well as toxicity to mammalian cells, of the resultant cross-linked polycations were investigated. METHODS. The efficiency of the cross-linked PEIs in delivering in vitro a plasmid containing \u03B2-galactosidase gene and their cytotoxicity were investigated in monkey kidney cells (COS-7). Dynamic light scattering was used to compare the relative DNA condensation efficiency of the unmodified and cross-linked PEIs. In vivo gene delivery efficiency was evaluated by intratracheal delivery in mice of the complexes of a luciferase-encoding plasmid and the PEIs and estimating the luciferase expression in the lungs. RESULTS. Cross-linking boosted the gene delivery efficiency of the small PEIs by 40- to 550-fold in vitro; the efficiency of the most potent conjugates even exceeded by an order of magnitude that of the branched 25-kDa PEI. Effective condensation of DNA was evident from the fact that the mean diameter of the complexes of the cross-linked PEIs was some 300 nm with a narrow size distribution, while the complexes of the unmodified small PEIs exhibited a mean size of \u003E700 nm with a very broad size distribution. At concentrations where the 25-kDa PEI resulted in \u003E95% cell death, the conjugates afforded nearly full cell viability. The cross-linked PEIs were 17 to 80 times m ore efficient than the unmodified ones in vivo; furthermore, their efficiencies were up to twice that of the 25-kDa PEI. CONCLUSIONS. Cross-linking of small PEIs with judiciously designed amide- and ester-bearing linkers boosts their gene delivery efficiency both in vitro and in vivo without increasing the cytotoxicity. The high efficiency is dependent on the nature of the linkages and the PEIs used.","publish_time":"2005-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Mini; Ge, Qing; Lu, James J.; Chen, Jianzhu; Klibanov, Alexander","journal":"Pharm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87950d1597c94a098901af9167b3e377218ceb66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzIxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene delivery efficiency","cross-linked PEIs","cross-linking of small PEIs","transfection efficiency","unmodified small PEIs","high efficiency","Smaller PEIs","kDa PEI","DNA delivery","intratracheal delivery","relative DNA condensation efficiency","efficient nonviral gene delivery vectors","cross-linking of branched","complexes","minimal cytotoxicity","\u03B2-galactosidase gene","biodegradable linkages","mean size","ore efficient","Effective condensation of DNA","resultant cross-linked polycations","unmodified ones","plasmid","narrow size distribution","broad size distribution","ester","polycation\u2019s effective molecular weight","mammalian cells","mean diameter","designed amide","potent conjugates","luciferase expression","cell death","cell viability","monkey kidney cells","intracellular breakdown","nature","times","linkers","fact","mice","Enhancement","COS","order of magnitude","mixture","noncytotoxic","Dynamic light scattering","lungs","concentrations","efficiencies","hypothesis","goal","Polyethylenimine","fold","PURPOSE","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We used the previously-isolated anti-DNA scFv, 3D8, as a target protein. During in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we observed that incorporation of the pseudoknot into the mRNA resulted in production of a translational intermediate that corresponded to the expected size for ribosomal arrest at the pseudoknot.

The recent advances in molecular biology techniques in the field of genomics and proteomics greatly facilitate the rapid identification with more accuracy. We have developed two real-time assays ie., SYBR green I based real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection as well as typing of some of the emerging viruses of biomedical importance viz. dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, west Nile, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) etc. Both these techniques are capable of detection and differentiation as well as quantifying viral load with higher sensitivity, rapidity, specificity. One of the most important advantages of LAMP is its field applicability, without requirement of any sophisticated equipments. Both these assays have been extensively evaluated and validated with clinical samples of recent epidemics from different parts of India.

In this work, an optimization method for sensors layout in air ductwork was presented. Three optimal objectives were defined, i.e. the minimum detection time, minimum contaminant exposure, and minimum probability of undetected pollution events. Genetic algorithm (GA) method was used to obtain the non-dominated solutions of multiobjectives optimization problem and the global optimal solution was selected among all of the non-dominated solutions by ordering solutions method. Since the biochemical attack occurred in a ventilation system was a random process, two releasing scenarios were proposed, i.e. the uniform and the air volume-based probability distribution. It was found that such a probability distribution affected the results of optimal sensors layout and also resulted in different detect time and different probability of undetected events. It was discussed how the objective functions are being compatible and competitive with each other, and how sensor quantity affect the optimal results and computational load. The impact of changes on other parameters was given, i.e. the deposition coefficient, the air volume distribution and the manual releasing.

Four died from transplant-related complications 0.7\u201312 months post- SCT, and six are alive and disease-free 9.7\u201392.6 months after the procedure. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the mean overall survival from CR for those assigned to autoSCT and alloSCT are 11.3 months (0.5\u201334.3) and 60.1 (2.3\u201398.3), respectively (log-rank, P \u003C 0.01). only 65% of patients who reached cr and 51% of the initial 37 cases underwent the intended sct. we conclude that few adults with refractory or relapsed all actually reach sct in cr even when the protocol used is designed for this purpose. autosct appears to offer little benefit in this setting, and an allosct from a related or unrelated donor should be rapidly pursued after achieving cr.","publish_time":"1998-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martino, R; Bellido, M; Brunet, S; Sureda, A; Peyret, M; Gu\u00E1rdia, R; Alt\u00E9s, A; Domingo-Alb\u00F3s, A; Sierra, J","journal":"Bone Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a040473aeeb87b2e91ecac43ad68938e7f50137.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CR","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["months post-SCT","months post- SCT","CR","allogeneic SCT","autologous SCT","autoSCT","alloSCT","patients","assigned transplant","early relapse","transplant-related complications","median","final intention","consecutive adults","primary refractory","intensive salvage chemotherapy regimen","stem cell transplantation","year period","analysis","availability","mean overall survival","histocompatible sibling","fungal infection","complete remission","log-rank","little benefit","setting","cases","intended","unrelated donor","ARDS","protocol","purged graft","purpose","procedure"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the association of EFS and toxicities with the following risk factors: age, gender, diagnosis, initial relapse risk and patient\u2013donor histocompatibility. The EFS probability is 33% at 800 days post-BMT. Twenty-six patients (36%) died of toxicity within 100 days and 14 (19%) have relapsed. EFS was inversely associated with age (P \u003C 0.0001) and initial relapse risk (P = 0.007). The risk of pulmonary (P = 0.023) and hepatic toxicity (P = 0.011) increased with age.

The probability of sepsis within 100 days post-BMT correlated (P = 0.007) with initial relapse risk.

One principle that has arisen from this work is that antiviral RNAi therapies must be tailored to the unique life cycle of each pathogen, including the choice of delivery vehicle, route of administration, gene(s) targeted and regulation and duration of RNAi induction. Although effective strategies will be customized to each virus, all such therapies must overcome similar challenges. Importantly, treatment strategies must compensate for the inevitable fact that viral genome sequences evolve extremely rapidly, and computational and bioinformatics approaches may aid in the development of therapies that resist viral escape. Furthermore, all RNAi strategies involve the delivery of nucleic acids to target cells, and all will therefore benefit from the development of enhanced gene design and delivery technologies. Here, we review the substantial progress that has been made towards identifying effective antiviral RNAi targets and discuss strategies for translating these findings into effective clinical therapies.","publish_time":"2005-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leonard, J N; Schaffer, D V","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75ec3ea2a888db55015ec109e74f6c94a0c505bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091878.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091878/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNAi strategies","antiviral RNAi therapies","effective strategies","development of therapies","effective antiviral RNAi targets","duration of RNAi induction","effective clinical therapies","treatment strategies","delivery technologies","viral infections","viral escape","choice of delivery vehicle","delivery of nucleic acids","viral genome sequences","development of enhanced gene design","route of administration","inevitable fact","downregulating genes","pathogen","regulation","numerous examples","field of directed RNA interference","work","findings","unique life cycle","wide range of viruses","promising approach","disease pathology","bioinformatics approaches","cells","technology","similar challenges","substantial progress","principle"],"language":"en"},

To better understand this inefficiency, we localized the expression of Pit2, the amphotropic receptor, in polarized human airway epithelia. Pit2 was expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells, suggesting that factors other than receptor abundance may limit apical gene transfer efficiency. Binding studies performed with radiolabeled amphotropic MuLV suggested that the apically applied virus binds to Pit2. Hypothetical barriers to retroviral gene transfer include the apical glycocalyx and other secreted products of epithelia. In this study, we demonstrated that sialic acid, keratan sulfate and collagen type V are present on the apical surface of well-differentiated human airway epithelia. While enzyme treatment reduced the abundance of these components, the treatment also decreased the transepithelial resistance to ~35% of the controls, suggesting that the epithelial integrity was impaired. To attain an airway epithelial culture with a modified apical surface and intact epithelial integrity, we utilized 100 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a glycosylation inhibitor, to prevent the glycocalyx from reforming following enzyme treatment. This approach allowed the resistance, but not the apical glycocalyx to recover. Despite this physical modification of the cell surface, the amphotropic retroviral vector failed to transduce airway epithelia following apical application. These results suggest that factors other than apical receptor abundance and the glycocalyx inhibit amphotropic retroviral gene transfer in human airway epithelia.","publish_time":"2002-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, G; Williams, G; Xia, H; Hickey, M; Shao, J; Davidson, BL; McCray, PB","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apical glycocalyx","apical application","apical receptor abundance","apical gene transfer efficiency","modified apical surface","amphotropic retroviral gene transfer","apical surface of well-differentiated human airway epithelia","amphotropic receptor","polarized human airway epithelia","amphotropic retroviral vector","inefficient following apical vector application","airway epithelial culture","secreted products of epithelia","retroviral vectors","enzyme treatment","radiolabeled amphotropic MuLV","cell surface","intact epithelial integrity","factors","expression of Pit2","transepithelial resistance","collagen type V","keratan sulfate","sialic acid","glucose","glycosylation inhibitor","Binding studies","cells","Hypothetical barriers","applied virus","deoxy-D","physical modification","basolateral surfaces","reforming","components","study","controls","results","inefficiency","approach"],"language":"en"},

This objective is becoming more attainable through the co-evolution of gene transfer vectors and regulation systems. The ideal vector should efficiently transduce non-dividing cells with minimal toxicity, thus endowing the system with persistent transgene expression. The helper-dependent adenovirus vectors meet these requirements, as demonstrated in various studies in the literature. The most promising regulation system is the tet-on system, which has low basal transcriptional activity and high inducibility. To explore the regulated transgene expression in the context of a helper-dependent vector, we constructed the HD-TET-IFN vector, containing the mIFN\u03B1 gene under the control of the tetracycline inducible transactivator rtTA2(s)-S2. Mice injected with HD-TET-IFN showed high levels of serum mIFN\u03B1 only upon transcriptional activation. The transgene expression was reinducible to the same high level up to 3 months p.i., and the amount of expressed cytokine could be regulated by dosing doxycycline. Transcriptional activation of mIFN\u03B1 induced by doxycycline resulted in prolonged survival and reduced liver damage in HD-TET-IFN-injected mice challenged with a lethal dose of coronavirus. Activation of antiviral genes mediated by doxycycline-dependent mIFN\u03B1 expression was also observed at low HD-TET-IFN doses. The possibility of controlling gene expression by the combination of HD vectors and the latest tet-on transactivator also holds promise for studying gene function in other animal models.","publish_time":"2002-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aurisicchio, L; Bujard, H; Hillen, W; Cortese, R; Ciliberto, G; La Monica, N; Palombo, F","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df6b49e371ee6cb1133f0426297352c77088ab15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091917.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mIFN\u03B1 gene","regulated expression","low HD-TET","regulated transgene expression","doxycycline-dependent mIFN\u03B1 expression","persistent transgene expression","gene therapy","gene function","possibility of controlling gene expression","IFN vector","latest tet","Transcriptional activation of mIFN\u03B1","combination of HD vectors","helper-dependent vector","IFN-injected mice","co-evolution of gene transfer vectors","efficient gene transfer protocols","IFN doses","desired transgene","high levels of serum mIFN\u03B1","helper-dependent adenovirus vectors","high inducibility","dosing doxycycline","promising regulation system","ideal vector","low basal transcriptional activity","Activation of antiviral genes","regulation systems","tetracycline inducible transactivator rtTA2","reduced liver damage","prolonged survival","tissue-specific","non-dividing cells","context","minimal toxicity","requirements","lethal dose of coronavirus","various studies","S2","animal models","major goal","expressed cytokine","literature","months","objective"],"language":"en"},

The requirement of gene transfer into the individual cell types of the complex lung structure will very much depend on the target disease. Over the last decade, the gene therapy community has recognized that there is not even one vector that is good for all applications, but that the gene transfer agent has to be carefully chosen. Gene therapy is particularly attractive for diseases that currently do not have satisfactory treatment options and probably easier for monogenic disorders than for complex diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) fulfills these criteria and is therefore a good candidate for gene therapy-based treatment. This review will focus on CF as an example for lung gene therapy and discuss the progress made in this field over the last couple of years.","publish_time":"2004-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griesenbach, U; Geddes, D M; Alton, E W F W","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f6d42cfcc4a07ce572bb2b375715dbc2476d978.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung gene therapy","gene therapy community","gene therapy-based treatment","requirement of gene transfer","gene transfer agent","complex diseases","chronic lung diseases","complex lung structure","CF","good candidate","satisfactory treatment options","individual cell types","monogenic disorders","wide range of acute","criteria","applications","progress","example","field","decade","Cystic fibrosis","couple of years","vector","target disease","review"],"language":"en"},

Generally, V. parahaemolyticus recovered from the environment and/or seafood is thought to be non-pathogenic and the relationship between environmental isolates and acute diarrhoeal disease is poorly understood. In this study, we explored the virulence potential of environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolated from water, plankton and assorted seafood samples collected from the Indian coast. RESULTS: Twenty-two V. parahaemolyticus isolates from seafood harboured virulence associated genes encoding the thermostable-direct haemolysin (TDH), TDH-related haemolysin (TRH), and Type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) and 95.5% of the toxigenic isolates had pandemic strain attributes (toxRS/new(\u002B)). Nine serovars, with pandemic strain traits were newly identified and an O4:K36 tdh(\u2212)trh(\u002B)V. parahaemolyticus bearing pandemic marker gene was recognised for the first time. Results obtained by reverse transcription PCR showed trh, T3SS1 and T3SS2\u03B2 to be functional in the seafood isolates. Moreover, the environmental strains were cytotoxic and could invade Caco-2 cells upon infection as well as induce changes to the tight junction protein, ZO-1 and the actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus are potentially invasive and capable of eliciting pathogenic characteristics typical of clinical strains and present a potential health risk. We also demonstrate that virulence of this pathogen is highly complex and hence draws attention for the need to investigate more reliable virulence markers in order to distinguish the environmental and clinical isolates, which will be crucial for the pathogenomics and control of this pathogen.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meparambu Prabhakaran, Divya; Ramamurthy, Thandavarayan; Thomas, Sabu","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5709b075a81a8aeadbc5c067fe234d83e9d25c31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092547.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parahaemolyticus isolates","seafood isolates","environmental isolates of","clinical isolates","virulence potential of environmental","environmental strains","toxigenic isolates","seafood harboured virulence","TRH","assorted seafood samples","TDH-related haemolysin","pandemic strain attributes","K36 tdh","pandemic strain traits","reliable virulence markers","study","RESULTS","pandemic marker gene","marine environment","thermostable-direct haemolysin","potential health risk","capable of eliciting pathogenic characteristics typical of clinical strains","genes","T3SS1","water","reverse transcription PCR","ZO","Type","T3SS2\u03B2","relationship","plankton","toxRS","order","evidence","acute diarrhoeal disease","changes","tight junction protein","Caco","need","secretion systems","Indian coast","infection","pathogenomics","control","O4","serovars","gastroenteritis","actin cytoskeleton","cells","attention","CONCLUSION","humans","BACKGROUND","time"],"language":"en"},

Limited human-to-human transmission, leading to some case clusters, has been reported. MERS-CoV has been reported in dromedary camels but phenotypic characterisation of such viruses is limited. We aimed to compare MERS-CoV isolates from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt with a prototype human MERS-CoV to assess virus replication competence and cell tropism in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. METHODS: We characterised MERS-CoV viruses from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and compared them with a human MERS-CoV reference strain. We assessed viral replication kinetics and competence in Vero-E6 cells (rhesus monkey), tissue tropism in cultures of ex-vivo human bronchial and lung tissues, and cytokine and chemokine induction, gene expression, and quantification of viral RNA in Calu-3 cells (human respiratory tract). We used mock-infected tissue as negative controls for ex-vivo experiments and influenza A H5N1 as a positive control for cytokine and chemokine induction experiments in Calu-3 cells. FINDINGS: We isolated three dromedary strains, two from Saudi Arabia (Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU13/2013 [AH13] and Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU19D/2013 [AH19D]), and one from Egypt (Dromedary/Egypt-NRCE-HKU270/2013 [NRCE-HKU270]). The human and dromedary MERS-CoV strains had similar viral replication competence in Vero-E6 cells and respiratory tropism in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract, and had similar ability to evade interferon responses in the human-respiratory-tract-derived cell line Calu-3. INTERPRETATION: The similarity of virus tropism and replication competence of human and dromedary MERS-CoV from the Arabian peninsula, and genetically diverse dromedary viruses from Egypt, in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract suggests that dromedary viruses from Saudi Arabia and Egypt are probably infectious to human beings. Exposure to zoonotic MERS-CoV is probably occurring in a wider geographical region beyond the Arabian peninsula.

Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed. Expert opinion: Treatment of SARS and MERS in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. Based on lessons learned from SARS and MERS outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Totura, Allison L.; Bavari, Sina","journal":"Expert Opin Drug Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32b941d4406406a70dbced2b906b6795b775f5d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849247/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2019.1581171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV","coronavirus antiviral activity","pathogenic coronavirus infection","pathogenic coronavirus pandemic","pathogenic coronavirus disease","pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","persistence of MERS","MERS outbreaks","CoV circulation","Treatment of SARS","multiple coronaviruses","general antiviral activity","novel respiratory syndromes","future emergence of novel coronaviruses","person","antiviral drug discovery","viral nonstructural proteins","efficacy data","essential host elements of viral infection","varying levels of efficacy","nonhuman primate models","good safety profiles","lack of drugs capable of pan","rodent","therapeutics","progression","potential","bat reservoir hosts","vulnerability of public health systems","outbreak settings","lethal zoonotic viruses","high morbidity","close contact","risks of re-emergence","mortality","approaches","ARDS","human populations","Expert opinion","review","lessons","Introduction","years","Areas"],"language":"en"},

There is evidence that the virus may sometimes spread beyond respiratory tract to cause disseminated infection. The primary target cell for HPAI H5N1 virus in human lung is the alveolar epithelial cell. Alveolar epithelium and its adjacent lung microvascular endothelium form host barriers to the initiation of infection and dissemination of influenza H5N1 infection in humans. These are polarized cells and the polarity of influenza virus entry and egress as well as the secretion of cytokines and chemokines from the virus infected cells are likely to be central to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. AIM: To study influenza A (H5N1) virus replication and host innate immune responses in polarized primary human alveolar epithelial cells and lung microvascular endothelial cells and its relevance to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. METHODS: We use an in vitro model of polarized primary human alveolar epithelial cells and lung microvascular endothelial cells grown in transwell culture inserts to compare infection with influenza A subtype H1N1 and H5N1 viruses via the apical or basolateral surfaces. RESULTS: We demonstrate that both influenza H1N1 and H5N1 viruses efficiently infect alveolar epithelial cells from both apical and basolateral surface of the epithelium but release of newly formed virus is mainly from the apical side of the epithelium. In contrast, influenza H5N1 virus, but not H1N1 virus, efficiently infected polarized microvascular endothelial cells from both apical and basolateral aspects. This provides a mechanistic explanation for how H5N1 virus may infect the lung from systemic circulation. Epidemiological evidence has implicated ingestion of virus-contaminated foods as the source of infection in some instances and our data suggests that viremia, secondary to, for example, gastro-intestinal infection, can potentially lead to infection of the lung. HPAI H5N1 virus was a more potent inducer of cytokines (e.g. IP-10, RANTES, IL-6) in comparison to H1N1 virus in alveolar epithelial cells, and these virus-induced chemokines were secreted onto both the apical and basolateral aspects of the polarized alveolar epithelium. CONCLUSION: The predilection of viruses for different routes of entry and egress from the infected cell is important in understanding the pathogenesis of influenza H5N1 infection and may help unravel the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease.","publish_time":"2009-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Michael CW; Chan, Renee WY; Yu, Wendy CL; Ho, Carol CC; Chui, WH; Lo, CK; Yuen, Kit M; Guan, Yi; Nicholls, John M; Peiris, JS Malik","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53c533539d95b75bb8f88fe08e4693f299fd116e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2780994.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19874627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["influenza H5N1 virus","HPAI H5N1 virus","H1N1 virus","virus infected cells","pathogenesis of influenza H5N1 infection","H5N1 viruses","virus replication","ingestion of virus","formed virus","dissemination of influenza H5N1 infection","polarized cells","pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease","polarity of influenza virus entry","human lung","influenza H1N1","virus-induced chemokines","lung microvascular endothelial cells","polarized alveolar epithelium","model of polarized primary human alveolar epithelial cells","infected polarized microvascular endothelial cells","study influenza","initiation of infection","source of infection","disseminated infection","pathogenic avian influenza","gastro-intestinal infection","basolateral aspects","subtype H1N1","basolateral surfaces","primary target cell","adjacent lung microvascular endothelium form host barriers","egress","predilection of viruses","humans","acute respiratory disease syndrome","respiratory tract","secretion of cytokines","Epidemiological evidence","different routes of entry","potent inducer of cytokines","immune responses","relevance","transwell culture","IP","example","contaminated foods","release","comparison","viremia","data","instances","death","poultry","Africa","BACKGROUND","Asia","mechanistic explanation","contrast","systemic circulation","RANTES","CONCLUSION","AIM","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment. METHODS: 3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Dudleya brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with oil red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h. RESULTS: The ROS production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. The PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights and directions for further research relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.","publish_time":"2019-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyungkuen; Jeon, Eek Hyung; Park, Byung-Chul; Kim, Sung-Jo","journal":"Asian-Australas J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f314a77ea26734587af46d6ed32345b0160760e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6817779.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5713/ajas.19.0251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dudleya"],"organizations":["SYBR","PMA","DB","TCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["survival of alveolar macrophages","cell cycle","cell death","cell survival rate","PMA treatment","PMA induced downregulation of cell survival","porcine alveolar macrophages model","expressions of fatty acid oxidation","DB-PMA co-treatment","fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels","tricarboxylic acid","exposure","TCA cycle genes","glycolysis genes expression","fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions","DB treatments","cycle related gene expression levels","Dudleya brittonii extraction","qPCR","cellular lipid accumulation","lipid metabolism","3D4","water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay","immunity of porcine respiratory system","respiratory immunity of livestock","traditional asthma treatment","ROS production","growth curve analysis","flow cytometric analysis","SYBR green dye","fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","oil red O staining","acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha","intracellular reactive oxygen species","corresponding increase","key role","new insights","propidium iodide","research","studies","mechanism of differentiation","study","directions","phorbol","myristate","RESULTS","distilled water","natural materials","CONCLUSION","changes","cells","METHODS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The meetings were attended by 168 health professionals, scientists, academics, ethicists, religious leaders, and other community members representing 40 countries in these regions. Methods: We reviewed the meeting reports, notes and stories and mapped outcomes to the key ethical challenges for pandemic influenza response described in the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) guidance, Ethical Considerations in Developing a Public Health Response to Pandemic Influenza: transparency and public engagement, allocation of resources, social distancing, obligations to and of healthcare workers, and international collaboration. Results: The important role of transparency and public engagement were widely accepted among participants. However, there was general agreement that no \u0022one size fits all\u0022 approach to allocating resources can address the variety of economic, cultural and other contextual factors that must be taken into account. The importance of social distancing as a tool to limit disease transmission was also recognized, but the difficulties associated with this measure were acknowledged. There was agreement that healthcare workers often have competing obligations and that government has a responsibility to assist healthcare workers in doing their job by providing appropriate training and equipment. Finally, there was agreement about the importance of international collaboration for combating global health threats. Conclusion: Although some cultural differences in the values that frame pandemic preparedness and response efforts were observed, participants generally agreed on the key ethical principles discussed in the WHO\u2019s guidance. Most significantly the input gathered from these regional meetings pointed to the important role that procedural ethics can play in bringing people and countries together to respond to the shared health threat posed by a pandemic influenza despite the existence of cultural differences.","publish_time":"2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lor, Aun; Thomas, James C.; Barrett, Drue H.; Ortmann, Leonard W.; Herrera Guibert, Dionisio J.","journal":"Int J Health Policy Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/711a2350fec569de818a1bd51ab4a3a8b793918c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5088725.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15171/ijhpm.2016.55; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27801360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Africa","Asia","Latin America","Eastern Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza response","Public Health Response","pandemic influenza preparedness","pandemic preparedness","ethical considerations","health professionals","cultural perspectives","healthcare workers","public engagement","response efforts","regional meetings","key ethical challenges","key ethical principles","World Health Organization\u2019s","global health threats","shared health threat","importance of international collaboration","importance of social distancing","existence of cultural differences","important role of transparency","obligations","WHO\u2019s guidance","participants","countries","general agreement","perspectives relevant","allocation of resources","Disease Control","disease transmission","mapped outcomes","stories","academics","religious leaders","Latin America","ethicists","notes","Eastern Mediterranean","Prevention","scientists","Africa","Asia","job","CDC","Centers","tool","values","meeting reports","community members","size fits","procedural ethics","variety of economic","responsibility","broad exploration","contextual factors","appropriate training","equipment","people","approach","government","Results","Methods","regions","input","Conclusion","difficulties","measure","account","Background"],"language":"en"},

The successful treatment of this disease depends on the early, timely and cost effective identification of affected animals. The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of an automated, RFID driven, noninvasive infrared thermography technology to determine BRD in cattle. Sixty-five calves averaging 220kg were exposed to standard industry practices of transport and auction. The animals were monitored for BRD using conventional biometric signs for clinical scores, core temperatures, haematology, serum cortisol and infrared thermal values over 3weeks. The data collected demonstrated that true positive animals for BRD based on a gold standard including core temperature, clinical score, white blood cell number and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio displayed higher peak infrared thermal values of 35.7\u00B10.35\u00B0C compared to true negative animals 34.9\u00B10.22\u00B0C (P \u003C0.01). The study also demonstrated that such biometric data can be non-invasively and automatically collected based on a system developed around the animal\u2019s water station.

Moreover, we find that most viral transcripts tend to shorten polyadenylation lengths as infection progresses. Development of an open reading frame centric bioinformatics analysis pipeline provided a deeper quantitative and qualitative understanding of adenovirus\u2019s genetic potential. Across the viral genome adenovirus makes multiple distinctly spliced transcripts that code for the same protein.

Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by L. infantum is an emergent feline disease more and more frequently reported in endemic areas. This review summarizes current knowledge focusing similarities and differences with canine leishmaniosis (CanL). Cats are infected by the same Leishmania species than dogs but prevalence of the infection is lower and cases of disease are less frequently reported. Scarce information is available on adaptive immune response of cats naturally exposed to L. infantum infection and mechanisms responsible for susceptibility or resistance of feline hosts. However, about half of clinical cases of FeL are reported in cats with possible impaired immunocompetence. Coinfections or comorbidities are frequently detected in sick cats and they can contribute to a misrepresentation of clinical FeL albeit lesions associated with the presence of the parasite have been detected in skin, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, liver, oral mucosa, stomach, large bowel, kidney, nasal exudate, lung, eye. As for dogs, skin or mucocutaneous lesions are the most common reason for veterinary consultation and finding on physical examination in cats with leishmaniosis. Molecular investigations of Leishmania DNA and anti- Leishmania antibody detection are largely used with the same methodologies for both CanL and FeL, however few information is available about their diagnostic performance in feline hosts. Treatment of cats with clinical FeL is still empirically based and off label by using the most common drugs prescribed to dogs. Life expectancy of cats with clinical FeL is usually good unless concurrent conditions or complications occur and prognosis does not seem significantly influenced by therapy or retroviral coinfection. According to current knowledge, cats can play a role as additional reservoir host of L. infantum and, in a \u00AB One Health \u00BB perspective, preventative measures should be taken. In conclusion, albeit feline infection and the associated cat disease caused by L. infantum is increasingly reported in endemic areas and have many similarities with CanL, consolidated evidence-based knowledge is not available and we cannot exclude that important differences between dogs and cats exist about transmission, immunopathogenesis and best practice for management and prevention.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Persichetti, Maria Flaminia","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/885c77c8535ecc8f77c5debd1f4d5291cc9ff1ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130840.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401718300190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29426470/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.01.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401718300190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leishmania"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Treatment of cats","dogs","sick cats","infantum infection","feline infection","Feline leishmaniosis","misrepresentation of clinical FeL","Life expectancy of cats","Abstract Leishmania infantum","emergent feline disease","half of clinical cases of FeL","adaptive immune response of cats","CanL","cases of disease","resistance of feline hosts","Leishmania species","zoonotic disease","current knowledge","associated cat disease","similarities","skin","canine leishmaniosis","endemic areas","parasite","anti- Leishmania antibody detection","Molecular investigations of Leishmania DNA","consolidated evidence-based knowledge","Scarce information","mucocutaneous lesions","common reason","important differences","common drugs","main reservoir","additional reservoir host of","bone marrow","large bowel","oral mucosa","susceptibility","nasal exudate","kidney","stomach","liver","spleen","concurrent conditions","mechanisms responsible","phlebotomine sand flies","best practice","veterinary consultation","lymph nodes","immunopathogenesis","physical examination","transmission","role","prevalence","diagnostic performance","vector","management","lung","complications","possible impaired immunocompetence","Health","perspective","preventative measures","prevention","eye","prognosis","comorbidities","review","presence","therapy","retroviral coinfection","label","conclusion","methodologies","Coinfections"],"language":"en"},

Considering the availability of the RSV vaccines in the coming years, molecular understanding in RSV is necessary. Objective The objective of the present study was to describe RSV epidemiology and genotype variability in Portugal during the 2014/15-2017/18 period. Material and methods Epidemiological data and RSV-positive samples from patients with a respiratory infection were collected through the non-sentinel and sentinel influenza surveillance system (ISS). RSV detection, subtyping in A and B, and sequencing of the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of G gene were performed by molecular methods. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and p-distance model on MEGA 7.0. Results RSV prevalence varied between the sentinel (2.5%, 97/3891) and the non-sentinel ISS (20.7%, 3138/16779), being higher (P \u003C 0.0001) among children aged \u003C5 years. Bronchiolitis (62.9%, 183/291) and influenza-like illness (24.6%, 14/57) were associated (P \u003C 0.0001) with RSV laboratory confirmation among children aged \u003C6 months and adults \u226565 years, respectively. The HVR2 was sequenced for 562 samples. RSV-A (46.4%, 261/562) and RSV-B (53.6%, 301/562) strains clustered mainly to ON1 (89.2%, 233/261) and BA9 (92%, 277/301) genotypes, respectively, although NA1 and BA10 were also present until 2015/2016. Conclusion The sequence and phylogenetic analysis reflected the relatively high diversity of Portuguese RSV strains. BA9 and ON1 genotypes, which have been circulating in Portugal since 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 respectively, predominated during the whole study period.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00E1ez-L\u00F3pez, Emma; Crist\u00F3v\u00E3o, Paula; Costa, In\u00EAs; Pechirra, Pedro; Conde, Patr\u00EDcia; Guiomar, Raquel; Peres, Maria Jo\u00E3o; Viseu, Regina; Lopes, Paulo; Soares, V\u00E2nia; Vale, F\u00E1tima; Fonseca, Patricia; Freitas, Ludivina; Alves, Jose; Pessanha, Maria Ana; Toscano, Cristina; Mota-Vieira, Lu\u00EDsa; Veloso, Rita Cabral; C\u00F4rte-Real, Rita; Branquinho, Paula; Pereira\u2011Vaz, Jo\u00E3o; Rodrigues, Fernando; Cunha, M\u00E1rio; Martins, Lu\u00EDs; Mota, Paula; Couto, Ana Rita; Bruges-Armas, J\u00E1come; Almeida, Sofia; Rodrigues, D\u00E9bora","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4fe065f337e5bfb3a405135d494bf5d12e47e79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106440.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31707201/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.104200; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219302185; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219302185","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","ISS"],"locations":["Portugal"],"keyphrases":["RSV-B","RSV epidemiology","RSV vaccines","RSV detection","RSV-positive samples","RSV laboratory confirmation","Results RSV prevalence","high diversity of Portuguese RSV strains","non-sentinel ISS","respiratory infection","young children","sentinel influenza surveillance system","molecular methods","coming years","Objective","present study","HVR2","Portugal","study period","ON1 genotypes","BA9","respiratory tract infections","p-distance model","molecular understanding","phylogenetic analysis","Phylogenetic trees","Abstract Introduction Respiratory syncytial virus","methods Epidemiological data","infants","predominant viral agent","G gene","patients","hypervariable region","mortality","Neighbor","months","genotype variability","Material","sequencing","Conclusion","sequence","elderly","substantial morbidity","adults","NA1","availability","BA10","illness","Bronchiolitis"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, whether the primary event in MS pathology affects myelin or axons of the CNS remains unclear. Animal models are necessary to identify the immunopathological mechanisms involved in MS and to develop novel therapeutic and reparative approaches. Specifically, viral models of chronic demyelination and axonal damage have been used to study the contribution of viruses in human MS, and they have led to important breakthroughs in our understanding of MS pathology. The Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model is one of the most commonly used MS models, although other viral models are also used, including neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that induce chronic inflammatory demyelination with similar histological features to those observed in MS. This review will discuss the immunopathological mechanisms involved in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). The TMEV model reproduces a chronic progressive disease due to the persistence of the virus for the entire lifespan in susceptible mice. The evolution and significance of the axonal damage and neuroinflammation, the importance of epitope spread from viral to myelin epitopes, the presence of abortive remyelination and the existence of a brain pathology in addition to the classical spinal cord demyelination, are some of the findings that will be discussed in the context of this TMEV-IDD model. Despite their limitations, viral models remain an important tool to study the etiology of MS, and to understand the clinical and pathological variability associated with this disease.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mecha, Miriam; Carrillo-Salinas, Francisco J.; Mestre, Leyre; Feli\u00FA, Ana; Guaza, Carmen","journal":"Progress in Neurobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07f3699e2eb7d0bfaad3848b07eb064f128df9dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23201558/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.11.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008212001712; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301008212001712","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","TMEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["used MS models","etiology of MS","human MS","TMEV model","viral models of chronic demyelination","understanding of MS pathology","TMEV-IDD model","Animal models","chronic inflammatory demyelination","chronic progressive disease","demyelinating disease","complex inflammatory disease of unknown etiology","axonal damage","brain pathology","CNS","immunopathological mechanisms","myelin epitopes","classical spinal cord demyelination","Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","important tool","important breakthroughs","neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus","addition","MHV","central nervous system","existence","presence of abortive remyelination","white matter","neuroinflammation","importance of epitope","similar histological features","persistence","axons","entire lifespan","significance","primary event","susceptible mice","Abstract Multiple sclerosis","reparative approaches","pathological variability","evolution","contribution of viruses","context","limitations","review","effective cure","findings"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ULDCT was performed prospectively in 207 febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancy. Three observers independently recorded the presence of lung parenchymal abnormality, and also indicated the cause of the lung parenchymal abnormality between infectious and noninfectious causes. If infectious pneumonia was considered the cause of lung abnormalities, they noted the two most appropriate diagnoses among four infectious conditions, including fungal, bacterial, viral, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. Sensitivity for correct diagnoses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy were calculated. Interobserver agreements were determined using intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Of 207 patients, 139 (67%) had pneumonia, 12 had noninfectious lung disease, and 56 had no remarkable chest computed tomography (CT) (20 with extrathoracic fever focus and 36 with no specific disease).

OAS1 polymorphism (rs2660) has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections and various diseases. In general, the low enzyme activity AA genotype promotes susceptibility whereas high enzyme activity GG genotype confers protection. In this study we investigated the association of this functional polymorphism (rs2660) in OAS1 with prostate cancer. METHODS: Sample size and power was calculated using the PGA software. Genomic DNA from a controls (n=140) and prostate cancer patients (n=164) were used for genotyping SNPs rs2660, rs1131454 and rs34137742 on all samples. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Significant association was observed between rs2660 genotype (A/G) and prostate cancer. Genotype AA increased the risk whereas GG genotype decreased the risk of prostate cancer. The GG genotype was not observed in the African American samples. The AA genotype also increased the risk of prostate cancer with age. CONCLUSIONS: OAS1 SNP rs2660 AA genotype is significantly associated with prostate cancer whereas GG genotype protects against prostate cancer. OAS1 rs2660 could be a prostate cancer susceptibility polymorphism, a significant observation especially in a context of the OAS1-RNaseL pathway. Thus a functional defect in OAS1 due to rs2660 SNP can not only attenuate RNaseL function, but can also alter cell growth and apoptosis independent of RNaseL.","publish_time":"2011-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mandal, Sanjay; Abebe, Fisseha; Chaudhary, Jaideep","journal":"Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/058a7fa8583f1506e75d91810cf5958d8bd3cfb7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c21fb11a9bf37a9ae2d0f6dadb5c08c360046549.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3167978.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21638280/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3167978?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.26219","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP","GG","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rs2660 genotype","OAS1 rs2660","risk of prostate cancer","Genotype AA","prostate cancer patients","prostate cancer susceptibility polymorphism","OAS1 SNP rs2660 AA genotype","OAS1 polymorphism","rs2660 SNP","candidate hereditary prostate cancer gene","OAS1-RNaseL pathway","high enzyme activity GG genotype","low enzyme activity AA genotype","genotyping SNPs rs2660","increased susceptibility","functional polymorphism","Significant association","apoptosis independent of RNaseL","attenuate RNaseL function","significant observation","functional defect","anti-proliferative gene","African American samples","power","ATP","antiviral","rs1131454","rs34137742","context","protection","CONCLUSIONS","cell growth","infections","various diseases","logistic regression model","Statistical analysis","METHODS","Sample size","Genomic DNA","controls","series","turn","age","PGA software","RESULTS","oligoadenylate synthetase","study","BACKGROUND","oligoadenylates"],"language":"en"},

Immune cells express receptors for estrogens (ER\u03B1 and ER\u03B2), androgens (AR), and progesterone (PR), and experimental manipulation of sex hormone levels or receptors has revealed that sex hormone receptor activity often underlies sex differences in immune cell numbers and/or functional responses in the respiratory tract. While elegant studies have defined mechanistic roles for sex hormones and receptors in innate immune cells, much remains to be learned about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of ER, PR, and AR in myeloid cells and innate lymphocytes to promote the initiation and resolution of antiviral immunity in the lung.

Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea and suspected to be affected by NNPDS were included in a case-control set up. A total of 989 piglets were clinically examined on a daily basis. Samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were selected for extensive virological examination using specific real time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) and general virus detection methods. RESULTS: A total of 91.7% of the animals tested positive by reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) for porcine kobuvirus 1 (PKV-1) while 9% and 3% were found to be positive for rotavirus A and porcine teschovirus (PTV), respectively. The overall prevalence of porcine astrovirus (PAstV) was 75% with 69.8% of the PAstV positive pigs infected with PAstV type 3. No animals tested positive for rotavirus C, coronavirus (TGEV, PEDV and PRCV), sapovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, saffoldvirus, cosavirus, klassevirus or porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Microarray analyses performed on a total of 18 animals were all negative, as were eight animals examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Using Next Generation de novo sequencing (de novo NGS) on pools of samples from case animals within all herds, PKV-1 was detected in four herds and rotavirus A, rotavirus C and PTV were detected in one herd each. CONCLUSIONS: Our detailed analyses of piglets from NNPDS-affected herds demonstrated that viruses did not pose a significant contribution to NNPDS. However, further investigations are needed to investigate if a systemic virus infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of NNPDS.","publish_time":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goecke, N.

It is unclear how the human immune system responds to this infection. Here, we used metatranscriptomic sequencing to profile immune signatures in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight COVID-19 cases. The expression of proinflammatory genes, especially chemokines, was markedly elevated in COVID-19 cases compared to community-acquired pneumonia patients and healthy controls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercytokinemia. Compared to SARS-CoV, which is thought to induce inadequate interferon (IFN) responses, SARS-CoV-2 robustly triggered expression of numerous IFN-inducible genes (ISGs). These ISGs exhibit immunopathogenic potential, with overrepresentation of genes involved in inflammation. The transcriptome data was also used to estimate immune cell populations, revealing increases in activated dendritic cells and neutrophils. Collectively, these host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection could further our understanding of disease pathogenesis and point towards antiviral strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Zhuo; Ren, Lili; Zhang, Li; Zhong, Jiaxin; Xiao, Yan; Jia, Zhilong; Guo, Li; Yang, Jing; Wang, Chun; Jiang, Shuai; Yang, Donghong; Zhang, Guoliang; Li, Hongru; Chen, Fuhui; Xu, Yu; Chen, Mingwei; Gao, Zhancheng; Yang, Jian; Dong, Jie; Liu, Bo; Zhang, Xiannian; Wang, Weidong; He, Kunlun; Jin, Qi; Li, Mingkun; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e10bd6e8479cc0809b6b38cc8961b160749246c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312820302444; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820302444?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","infection","COVID","immune signatures","overrepresentation of genes","expression of proinflammatory genes","cases","triggered expression of numerous IFN-inducible genes","human immune system","immune cell populations","host responses","novel coronavirus disease","understanding of disease pathogenesis","ISGs exhibit immunopathogenic potential","increases","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","severe threat","community","healthy controls","pneumonia patients","global public health","outbreaks","chemokines","dendritic cells","inadequate interferon","neutrophils","Summary","antiviral strategies","metatranscriptomic sequencing","inflammation","hypercytokinemia","transcriptome data"],"language":"en"},

The biosynthesis and accumulation of these metabolites are closely linked to nitrogen availability; the benefits of low nitrogen application on the environment and herb quality are increasingly prominent. To analyze metabolic changes in the leaves and roots of I.indigotica in nitrogen deficiency conditions, and to identify the pathways and metabolites induced by low nitrogen availability, we used untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TripleTOF) to obtain metabolomics profiling of I.indigotica under two N-deficiency treatments (0 kg/hm2; 337.5 kg/hm2) and normal nitrogen treatment (675 kg/hm2). A total of 447 metabolites were annotated. Principal component analysis separated the three nitrogen treatments. A greater diversity of metabolites was observed in roots than in leaves under N-deficiency treatments, suggesting that roots have a more important function in low N tolerance. Differential metabolites were mainly enriched in purine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, tryptophan metabolism, and flavonoid biosynthesis that notably induced only in leaves in low nitrogen stress. Moderate N-deficiency benefits carbohydrate accumulation, whereas accumulation of most amino acids decreases. Uniquely, L-tryptophan was maintained at a high concentration in N-deficiency conditions. Low nitrogen stress induced the accumulation of some specialized metabolites (matairesinol, dictamnine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (serotonin) in roots and vitexin, xanthohumol, sinapyl alcohol in leaves). N-deficiency also increased the accumulation of adenosine and quality indicators of I.indigotica (indirubin-indigo, epigoitrin and anthranilic acid) in a certain degree. Our findings showed that nitrogen deficiency modified roots and leaves conditions of I.indigotica, affecting both the primary and secondary metabolism. Moderate nitrogen reduction was beneficial to the accumulation of active ingredients.

Methods The participants were 289 university students ranging in age, income, and ethnic backgrounds. They were presented with scenarios describing avian flu outbreaks affecting their community. They reported their anticipated emotional responses (positive emotion, negative emotion) and behavioral responses (helping, avoidance, sacrifice, illegal behavior) as if the scenarios were actually occurring. They also were assessed on individual differences expected to predict their responses. Results Participants were only modestly familiar with the avian flu and anticipated strong emotional and behavioral responses to an outbreak. Path analyses were conducted to test a model for predicting responses. The model showed that age, sex, income, spirituality, resilience, and neuroticism were related to responses. Spirituality, resilience, and income predicted better emotional responses, and neuroticism and female sex predicted worse emotional responses. Age, sex, income, and spirituality had direct effects on behavior. The emotional responses were directly related to each behavior and mediated the effects of individual differences. Conclusion Emotional responses may be important in predicting behavior after an outbreak of avian flu, and personal characteristics may predict both emotional and behavioral responses.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Bruce W.; Kay, Virginia S.; Hoyt, Timothy V.; Bernard, Michael L.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d1367d2f8b788fc9ecd63db9562175ea9024400.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124230.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19121548/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655308007591; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2008.08.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655308007591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["behavioral responses","anticipated emotional responses","worse emotional responses","Conclusion Emotional responses","income","outbreak of avian flu","avian flu outbreaks","spirituality","age","predicting behavior","model","illegal behavior","female sex","neuroticism","resilience","effects of individual differences","scenarios","negative emotion","positive emotion","direct effects","Results Participants","university students","avoidance","personal characteristics","sacrifice","Methods","ethnic backgrounds","community","study","Path analyses","purpose"],"language":"en"},

We now know that they are much more than just anti\u2010viral cytokines collectively having roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses, in tumor surveillance and defense, and modulation of immune cell function. Three types of IFN have now been described, simply referred to as type I, II and III. Distinguishable by the unique receptors that they rely on for signal transduction, the three types of IFN have specific and varied roles in the maintenance of human health and defense against pathogens. In mounting an IFN\u2010mediated immune response, the human body has developed the ability to regulate IFN\u2010mediated signal transduction. Like all cytokines, the ability of a cell to respond to IFN is completely dependent on the presence of its cognate receptor on the surface of the target cell. Thus, one of the major mechanisms used by the human body to regulate the strength and duration of the IFN response is through regulation of receptor levels, thereby altering the cytokine\u2010specific responsiveness of the target cell. This review will discuss the receptor system utilized by the type I IFNs and compare it with that of the type II and III IFNs, which also regulate immune responses through controlling receptor level on the cell surface.","publish_time":"2012-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Weerd, Nicole A; Nguyen, Thao","journal":"Immunol Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e077282fd63ed2a503fad76933d684d2a2651135.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165917.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22410872/; https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2012.9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN response","types of IFN","cell surface","target cell","ability","IFNs","modulation of immune cell function","human body","cognate receptor","receptor system","adaptive immune responses","defense","controlling receptor level","regulation of receptor levels","mediated signal transduction","maintenance of human health","anti\u2010viral cytokines","varied roles","specific responsiveness","viral resistance","tumor surveillance","strength","presence","duration","cells","major mechanisms","pathogens","unique receptors","review","interferons","years"],"language":"en"},

In this study we investigated the effect of direct addition of exogenous human apoD protein purified from breast cystic fluid to rat hippocampal slice cultures after excitotoxic injury induced by the glutamate analog kainate. ApoD at a concentration of 10\u03BCg/ml partially prevented loss of MAP2 immunostaining and LDH release from injured hippocampal neurons after kainate injury.

In view of the molecular structure of apoD which consists of an eight stranded \u03B2 barrel that forms a binding pocket for a number of small hydrophobic molecules, we propose that apoD promotes its neuroprotective effects by binding to arachidonic acid and cholesterol thus preventing their oxidation to neurotoxic products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 7-ketocholesterol.","publish_time":"2009-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Xin; Jittiwat, Jinatta; Kim, Ji-Hyun; Jenner, Andrew M.; Farooqui, Akhlaq A.; Patel, Shutish C.; Ong, Wei-Yi","journal":"Neuroscience Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dd71304d52ae9cf97d31755e9641fafa6d7e86c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117013.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394009003164; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2009.03.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304394009003164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19429117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular structure of apoD","oxidative products of arachidonic acid","protective function of mammalian apoD","kainate injury","kainate treatment","ketocholesterol","effect of direct addition of exogenous human apoD protein","number of small lipophilic molecules","number of small hydrophobic molecules","glutamate analog kainate","binding pocket","excitotoxic injury","oxidative stress","neurotoxic products","injured hippocampal neurons","hippocampal slice cultures","LDH release","breast cystic fluid","prevented loss of MAP2 immunostaining","insect","lipocalin family of transporter proteins","member","neuroprotective effects","increase","F2-isoprostanes","plant homologs","stranded \u03B2 barrel","\u03BCg","oxidation","Recent studies","Abstract Apolipoprotein D","hydroxynonenal","view","study","HNE","concentration"],"language":"en"},

A multivariable model was used to investigate reasons for the association between asthma and severe outcomes (intensive care unit support or death). Asthmatics were less likely than nonasthmatics to have severe outcome (11.2% versus 19.8%, unadjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36\u20130.72) despite a greater proportion requiring oxygen on admission (36.4% versus 26%, unadjusted OR 1.63) and similar rates of pneumonia (17.1% versus 16.6%, unadjusted OR 1.04).

There are considerable regulatory challenges to consider in commercialization of plant\u2010made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), some of which are inherent to plant\u2010production systems and others that are common with other production systems, but are new to PMPs because of the youth of the industry. In this review, we discuss our recent and ongoing experience with bulk production of the HIV microbicide candidate, griffithsin (GRFT), utilizing plant\u2010based transient protein expression, with specific focus on areas relevant to commercial manufacturing of bulk GRFT active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Analytical programs have been developed for the qualification and monitoring of both the expression vector system and the API detailing our experience and plans for each. Monitoring postpurification protein modifications are discussed in relation to stability and safety programs. Expression, processing and analytics programs are associated with increased manufacturing costs in current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production because of the required qualification testing. The impact of these costs on the overall cost of goods is particularly relevant to GRFT manufacturing because GRFT, as an HIV microbicide, is most needed in populations at high risk for HIV exposure in resource\u2010poor countries. Consequently, GRFT for microbicide applications is a very cost\u2010sensitive recombinant PMP. We have therefore emphasized maintaining a low cost of goods. We provide a review of the literature on the economics of PMPs with various expression systems and how they may impact production costs and complexity.","publish_time":"2015-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fuqua, Joshua L.; Hamorsky, Krystal; Khalsa, Guruatma; Matoba, Nobuyuki; Palmer, Kenneth E.","journal":"Plant Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c159594c91b5f2608137dd010930f11a9baf209.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5016770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26176205/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.12433","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GRFT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production systems","GRFT manufacturing","production costs","based protein expression systems","bulk production of recombinant protein pharmaceuticals","transient protein expression","various expression systems","increased manufacturing costs","commercialization of plant","Application of plant","HIV microbicide candidate","expression vector system","commercial manufacturing of bulk GRFT active pharmaceutical ingredient","HIV exposure","API","Monitoring postpurification protein modifications","economics of PMPs","microbicide applications","analytics programs","overall cost of goods","safety programs","low cost of goods","Analytical programs","review","impact","current good manufacturing practice","areas relevant","ongoing experience","sensitive recombinant PMP","required qualification testing","specific focus","cGMP","resource","high risk","populations","relation","griffithsin","stability","poor countries","considerable regulatory challenges","youth","literature","processing","momentum","industry","plans","complexity"],"language":"en"},

ITDS detect a difference between the subject and ambient temperature, making deployment in hot climates more challenging. This study, conducted in Singapore, a tropical city, evaluates the accuracy of three different ITDS for fever detection compared with traditional oral thermometry and self-reporting in a clinical setting. Study design This study is a prospective operational evaluation conducted in the Singapore military on all personnel seeking medical care at a high-volume primary healthcare centre over a one week period in February 2014. Methods Three ITDS, the STE Infrared Fever Screening System (IFSS), the Omnisense Sentry MKIII and the handheld Quick Shot Infrared Thermoscope HT-F03B, were evaluated. Temperature measurements were taken outside the healthcare centre, under a sheltered walkway and compared to oral temperature. Subjects were asked if they had fever. Results There were 430 subjects screened, of whom 34 participants (7.9%) had confirmed fever, determined by oral thermometer measurement. The handheld infrared thermoscope had a very low sensitivity (29.4%), but a high specificity (96.8%). The STE ITDS had a moderate sensitivity (44.1%), but a very high specificity (99.1%). Self-reported fevers showed good sensitivity (88.2%) and specificity (93.9%). The sensitivity of the Omnisense ITDS (89.7%) was the highest among the three methods with good specificity (92.0%). Conclusion The new generation Omnisense ITDS displayed a relatively high sensitivity and specificity for fever. Though it has a lower sensitivity, the old generation STE ITDS system showed a very high specificity. Self-reporting of fever was reliable. The handheld thermograph should not be used as a fever-screening tool under tropical conditions.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tay, M. R.; Low, Y. L.; Zhao, X.; Cook, A.

Information on the characteristics of children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited 10 children infected with SARS-COV-2 from January 27 to March 10, 2020, in Changsha, China. We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT findings for these children. Qualitative descriptive analysis was used to describe the key results. RESULTS: Ten children were included. Three were male and seven were female. Three were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, and seven were from Changsha. All had a history of close contact with adults with COVID-19 before the onset of disease. Clinical manifestations included fever in four cases, respiratory symptoms in three cases, febrile convulsions in one case, vomiting in one case, abdominal pain in one case, and asymptomatic infection in two cases. All the children tested positive for nucleic acid in throat swabs at admission. Stool swabs of three cases were positive for nucleic acid after several days of fever. In nine children, blood routine results were normal, whereas in one case the white blood cell count was elevated. In four cases, CT findings of the lungs showed light ground-glass opacities, one case showed changes similar to bronchopneumonia, and the remaining cases were normal. All were treated with symptomatic support without complications. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children. The results of stool swab tests should be considered for discharge and release from isolation.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Yu-pin; Tan, Bo-yu; Pan, Jia; Wu, Jing; Zeng, Sai-zhen; Wei, Hong-yan","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a53d30adbd13d943afa8fe9bcd6b92bd794f0dd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195108.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302953/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104353; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220300950; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220300950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["characteristics of children","remaining cases","COVID","key results","blood routine results","nucleic acid","high-resolution CT findings","Stool swabs","Coronavirus Disease","results of stool swab tests","Wuhan","China","Changsha","intrafamily transmission","throat swabs","days of fever","new coronavirus","Clinical manifestations","onset of disease","main form of transmission","white blood cell count","lungs","light ground-glass opacities","respiratory symptoms","changes similar","laboratory","bronchopneumonia","persistent intestinal excretion of virus","febrile convulsions","discharge","adults","admission","history of close contact","abdominal pain","asymptomatic infection","outbreak","retrospective study","Hubei Province","Qualitative descriptive analysis","symptomatic support","complications","release","isolation","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","SARS-COV","Information","female","world"],"language":"en"},

The sizes of coding regions of some genes varied among IBV isolates due to deletion or insertion of nucleotides; the nucleotide similarities of S1, S2, 3a, 3b and E genes among the 27 isolates were 75.9%\u2013100.0%, 85%\u2013100.0%, 64.0%\u2013100.0%, 60.4%\u2013100.0% and 83.1%\u2013100.0%, respectively. According to phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene, the 27 isolates were divided into five genotypes, Mass, Korean-I (K-I), QX-like, KM91-like and New cluster 1. The phylogenetic trees based on the S2, 3a, 3b, E genes and S1-S2-3a-3b-E (S1-E) region nucleotide sequences did not closely follow the clustering based on the S1 sequence. The New cluster 1 prevalent during 2009 and 2010 was not found in 2011 but QX-like viruses became prevalent in 2011. The recombination analysis revealed two new S gene recombinants, 11036 and 11052 which might have been derived from recombinations between the New cluster 1 and QX-like viruses and between the K-I and H120 (vaccine) viruses, respectively.

IFN-\u03BBs act by binding to the heterodimeric IFN-\u03BB receptor (IFNLR), activating a STAT phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascade. Thereby hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes are induced, which modulate various immune functions via complex forward and feedback loops. When compared to the well-characterized IFN-\u03B1 signaling cascade, three important differences have been discovered. First, the IFNLR is not ubiquitously expressed: in particular, immune cells show significant variation in the expression levels of and susceptibilities to IFN-\u03BBs. Second, the binding affinities of individual IFN-\u03BBs to the IFNLR varies greatly and are generally lower compared to the binding affinities of IFN-\u03B1 to its receptor. Finally, genetic variation in the form of a series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to genes involved in the IFN-\u03BB signaling cascade has been described and associated with the clinical course and treatment outcomes of hepatitis B and C virus infection. The clinical impact of IFN-\u03BB signaling and the SNP variations may, however, reach far beyond viral hepatitis. Recent publications show important roles for IFN-\u03BBs in a broad range of viral infections such as human T-cell leukemia type-1 virus, rotaviruses, and influenza virus. IFN-\u03BB also potentially modulates the course of bacterial colonization and infections as shown for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the immunological processes involved in controlling viral and bacterial infections are distinct, IFN-\u03BBs may interfere at various levels: as an innate immune cytokine with direct antiviral effects; or as a modulator of IFN-\u03B1-induced signaling via the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 inhibitory feedback loops. In addition, the modulation of adaptive immune functions via macrophage and dendritic cell polarization, and subsequent priming, activation, and proliferation of pathogen-specific T- and B-cells may also be important elements associated with infectious disease outcomes. This review summarizes the emerging details of the IFN-\u03BB immunobiology in the context of the host immune response and viral and bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Syedbasha, Mohammedyaseen; Egli, Adrian","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ed1dcfad7266bfda122685c0009ec526f77909f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5328987.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293236/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modulator of IFN","hundreds of IFN","IFN-\u03BBs act","IFN-\u03BB immunobiology","binding affinities of IFN","clinical impact of IFN","heterodimeric IFN-\u03BB receptor","binding affinities of individual IFN-\u03BBs","well-characterized IFN-\u03B1","bacterial infections","immune cells","context of infections","various immune functions","viral hepatitis","cascade","IFNLR","broad range of viral infections","innate immune cytokine","host immune response","network of induced genes","modulation of adaptive immune functions","B-cells","specific T","various levels","important elements","important roles","influenza virus","course of bacterial colonization","important differences","clinical course","stimulated genes","treatment outcomes of hepatitis B","C virus infection","inhibitory feedback loops","expression levels","significant variation","genetic variation","suppressor of cytokine","human T-cell leukemia type","dendritic cell polarization","ubiquitin-specific peptidase","infectious disease outcomes","macrophage","subsequent priming","complex forward","direct antiviral effects","proliferation of pathogen","activation","series of single","rotaviruses","nucleotide polymorphisms","Staphylococcus aureus","autoimmune diseases","emerging details","form","SNPs","Recent publications","IFNL1","susceptibilities","STAT phosphorylation-dependent","Interferon lambdas","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","addition","immunity","immunological processes","SNP variations","review"],"language":"en"},

We describe the seasonal variation in NHS Direct respiratory calls (a new source of primary care data) and estimate the contribution of specific respiratory pathogens to this variation. Methods Linear regression models were used to estimate the weekly contribution of specific respiratory pathogens to the volume of NHS Direct respiratory calls (England and Wales, 2002\u20132004, all ages and 0\u20134years). Results Annual peaks in NHS Direct cough and difficulty breathing calls occurred in late December, with peaks in \u2018cold/flu\u2019 and fever calls occurring between November and April. The main explanatory variables were influenza (estimated to account for 72.5 calls per 100,000/year; 22% of \u2018cold/flu\u2019 calls; 15% of cough; and 13% of fever) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.5 per 100,000; 33% of \u2018cold/flu\u2019 calls; 20% of cough; and 15% of fever (0\u20134years)).

In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections. First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic. Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk. Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on Streptococcus pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy). Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication. Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate. In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Micallef, Jo\u00EBlle; Soeiro, Thomas; Annie-Pierre, Jonville\u2010B\u00E9ra","journal":"Therapie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a70941946d1a1e95e19d91856ce83fe4718d1b08.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418728/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720300925?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720300925","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NSAID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe bacterial infections","NSAIDs","increased risk of severe bacterial complication","non-severe symptoms","symptomatic treatment of fever","well-known risk","case of infection","non-rheumatic pain","muscular pain","case of lung infections","experimental data","short NSAID treatment","underlying infection","Streptococcus pyogenes infections","immunomodulatory effects","causal link","clinical observations","range of clinical","recommendation of precaution","recommended doses","animal studies","pharmacoepidemiological studies","Summary Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data","French Pharmacovigilance Network","scientific arguments","safer drug alternative","paracetamol","ibuprofen","care","reduced antibiotics efficacy","biological mechanisms","optional prescription status","level of expression","common sense","frequent use","headaches","angiotensin","existence","cough","indications","protopathic bias","enzyme","pneumopathy","myalgia","emergence of COVID"],"language":"en"},

However, there is no effective anti-viral therapy or licensed vaccines currently available for these human pathogens. The envelope glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus, which mediates entry into target cells, is cytotoxic and this effect maps to a highly glycosylated mucin-like region in the surface subunit of GP (GP1). However, the mechanism underlying this cytotoxic property of GP is unknown. To gain insight into the basis of this GP-induced cytotoxicity, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with full-length and mucin-deleted (\u0394mucin) Ebola GP plasmids and GP localization was examined relative to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, early and late endosomes using deconvolution fluorescent microscopy. Full-length Ebola GP was observed to accumulate in the ER. In contrast, GP\u0394mucin was uniformly expressed throughout the cell and did not localize in the ER. The Ebola major matrix protein VP40 was also co-expressed with GP to investigate its influence on GP localization. GP and VP40 co-expression did not alter GP localization to the ER. Also, when VP40 was co-expressed with the nucleoprotein (NP), it localized to the plasma membrane while NP accumulated in distinct cytoplasmic structures lined with vimentin. These latter structures are consistent with aggresomes and may serve as assembly sites for filoviral nucleocapsids. Collectively, these data suggest that full-length GP, but not GP\u0394mucin, accumulates in the ER in close proximity to the nuclear membrane, which may underscore its cytotoxic property.","publish_time":"2011-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhattacharyya, Suchita; Hope, Thomas J","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/464e498ad4c25f88b02533864c5415900e53e412.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3024955.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21223600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola GP","NP"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["GP localization","full-length GP","Full-length Ebola GP","Ebola GP plasmids","cytotoxic property of GP","GP-induced cytotoxicity","surface subunit of GP","Ebola virus","VP40 co-expression","Ebola major matrix protein VP40","NP","GP\u0394mucin","HEK293T cells","target cells","glycosylated mucin","nuclear membrane","plasma membrane","distinct cytoplasmic structures","licensed vaccines","late endosomes","Golgi","effective anti-viral therapy","endoplasmic reticulum","nucleus","region","entry","deconvolution fluorescent microscopy","effect maps","assembly sites","aggresomes","basis","close proximity","human pathogens","Filoviridae family","Marburg viruses","envelope glycoprotein","filoviral nucleocapsids","vimentin","GP1","nucleoprotein","mechanism","influence","lethal hemorrhagic fever","insight","data","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The etiological pathogens and prognostic factors of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infections were prospectively investigated. METHODS: Enrolled children fulfilled the following criteria: (1) PICU admission; (2) age of 1 month to 16 years; (3) diagnosis of infectious pneumonia and respiratory virus infection; and (4) development of severe ARDS within 72 h after PICU admission. Pathogens were detected in the blood and tracheal lavage fluid using molecular techniques and a conventional culture system. The serum levels of inflammatory mediators on the day of PICU admission were examined. RESULTS: Fifty\u2010seven patients (32 boys; median age, 9 months) were enrolled. Multiple virus infections, co\u2010infection with bacteria/fungus, and bacteremia/fungemia were observed in 60%, 49%, and 32% of children, respectively. Adenovirus\u2010B, measles virus, and cytomegalovirus were detected predominantly in tracheal lavage fluid. There were no statistically significant differences between non\u2010survivors and survivors regarding the types of pathogen, incidence of multiple virus infection, gender, age, clinical features, and treatment. The serum levels of interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03B3 and the IFN\u2010\u03B3/interleukin (IL)\u201010 ratio were higher in non\u2010survivors. CONCLUSIONS: IFN\u2010\u03B3 upregulation as detected on the day of PICU admission was found to be one of the possible prognostic factors affecting a fatal outcome.

Significant references lead to a delineation of a hypothetical ecosystem of Filoviridae including Chiroptera. IgG-specific Ebola-Zaire antibodies were detected in Hammer-headed Bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus), Epauletted Fruit Bats (Epomops franqueti), and Little Collared Fruit Bats (Myonycteris torquata) during Ebola outbreaks between 2001 and 2005 in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo. The discovery of IgG-specific-Marburg virus antibodies and virus-specific ribonucleic acid in Egyptian Fruit Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) provided further indication for the exploration of the reservoir host. In 2007, the Marburg virus isolation could for the first time be accomplished directly from apparently healthy and naturally infected Egyptian Fruit Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in Kitaka Mine (Uganda). Risk groups can be defined through chronological reprocessing and interpretation of existing epidemic-outbreaks on the African continent and the search for infection reasons of the index cases.

At concentrations ranging from physiological to supraphysiological (3.7\u2013370 \u03BCM), flavonoids, including genistein, have been shown to reduce the infectivity of a variety of viruses affecting humans and animals, including adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and rotavirus. Although the biological properties of the flavonoids are well studied, the mechanisms of action underlying their antiviral properties have not been fully elucidated. Current results suggest a combination of effects on both the virus and the host cell. Isoflavones have been reported to affect virus binding, entry, replication, viral protein translation and formation of certain virus envelope glycoprotein complexes. Isoflavones also affect a variety of host cell signaling processes, including induction of gene transcription factors and secretion of cytokines. The efficacy of isoflavones and related flavonoids in virus infectivity in in vitro bioassays is dependent on the dose, frequency of administration and combination of isoflavones used.

The capacity of coronaviruses to undergo recombination may be related to its mRNA transcription mechanism, which involves discontinuous RNA synthesis, suggesting the nonprocessive nature of the viral polymerase.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether an individualized titration of mechanical ventilation according to cardiopulmonary physiology reduces the mortality in patients with class III obesity and ARDS. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled adults admitted to the ICU from 2012 to 2017 who had class III obesity and ARDS and received mechanical ventilation for \u003E 48 h. Enrolled patients were divided in two cohorts: one cohort (2012\u20132014) had ventilator settings determined by the ARDSnet table for lower positive end-expiratory pressure/higher inspiratory fraction of oxygen (standard protocol-based cohort); the other cohort (2015\u20132017) had ventilator settings determined by an individualized protocol established by a lung rescue team (lung rescue team cohort). The lung rescue team used lung recruitment maneuvers, esophageal manometry, and hemodynamic monitoring. RESULTS: The standard protocol-based cohort included 70 patients (BMI = 49 \u00B1 9 kg/m(2)), and the lung rescue team cohort included 50 patients (BMI = 54 \u00B1 13 kg/m(2)). Patients in the standard protocol-based cohort compared to lung rescue team cohort had almost double the risk of dying at 28 days [31% versus 16%, P = 0.012; hazard ratio (HR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI95%) 0.13\u20130.78] and 3 months (41% versus 22%, P = 0.006; HR 0.35; CI95% 0.16\u20130.74), and this effect persisted at 6 months and 1 year (incidence of death unchanged 41% versus 22%, P = 0.006; HR 0.35; CI95% 0.16\u20130.74).

However, identification of infectious agents in severe pneumonia remains a major challenge so far. In this study, the potential utility of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in detecting nonbacterial pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia was retrospectively evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 106 patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia at our hospital from September 2015 to December 2017 were included, and their baseline clinical characteristics were collected. Nonbacterial infectious agents detected by TEM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serological tests were summarized. The detection rates were further compared between TEM and serological tests. RESULTS: BALF examination under the transmission electron microscope revealed 24 viruses, 16 mycoplasmas, 18 chlamydia, 2 fungi and 74 bacteria in 99 samples, among which 61 samples were mixed infections. The combined use of serological tests and TEM significantly improved the detection rate of nonbacterial infectious agents in patients with severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that implementation of TEM could improve the sensitivity for detecting viruses, atypical pathogens and mixed infections in BALF from patient of severe pneumonia. Therefore, TEM may be used as an auxiliary diagnostic method of other microbiological tests in severe pneumonia.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Juan; Hu, Chengping; Li, Yuanyuan; Pan, Pinhua; Su, Xiaoli; Deng, Pengbo; Wang, Junpu; Wu, Xiaoying","journal":"Am J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093854/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TEM","BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patient of severe pneumonia","implementation of TEM","nonbacterial pathogens","microbiological tests","prognosis of patients","detection rate of nonbacterial infectious agents","identification of infectious agents","combined use of serological tests","BALF examination","viruses","mixed infections","samples","transmission electron microscope","atypical pathogens","detection rates","potential utility of transmission electron microscopy","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","sensitivity","great mortality","auxiliary diagnostic method","fungi","chlamydia","mycoplasmas","data support","total","effective anti-infective therapy","major challenge","CONCLUSIONS","morbidity","study","METHODS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","baseline clinical characteristics","MATERIALS","hospital"],"language":"en"},

The response of bats to this process is highly species-specific: some species tolerate urban habitat or are even favoured by its roosting or foraging opportunities, others are affected by the loss or fragmentation of key natural habitat, or by the physical and chemical pollution associated with urbanization. Species responses generally translate into altered community structures, with few markedly dominating species. We propose different hypothetical models of bat fitness along an urbanization gradient and discuss why bat population density may not be an effective fitness proxy to assess the reactions of these mammals to urban expansion. We also suggest that urban habitat may act as an ecological trap even for apparently synurbic species. Overall, bat sensitivity to urbanization makes these mammals promising candidates to track the effects of this process of land use change on the biota, but more studies, specifically tailored to explore this role, are needed.","publish_time":"2014-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russo, Danilo; Ancillotto, Leonardo","journal":"Mamm Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4fcb3e9db0176f59bcceffda3c6171dca7b0bad.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urban habitat","effects of urban expansion","urbanization gradient","bioindicators of urbanization","Species responses","synurbic species","bat sensitivity","bat population density","mammals promising candidates","different hypothetical models of bat fitness","fragmentation of key natural habitat","response of bats","effective fitness proxy","process of land use change","reactions","current knowledge","ecological trap","biota","loss","altered community structures","potential","chemical pollution","roosting","foraging opportunities","article","studies","role"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This prospective study compared clinical presentation, outcomes, microbial etiology, and treatment of HCAP, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and immunocompromised patients (ICP) with severe pneumonia admitted to 34 Spanish ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 726 patients with pneumonia (449 CAP, 133 HCAP, and 144 ICP) were recruited during 1 year from April 2011. HCAP patients had more comorbidities and worse clinical status (Barthel score). HCAP and ICP patients needed mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy more frequently than CAP patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all three groups (CAP, 34.2 %; HCAP, 19.5 %; ICP, 23.4 %; p = 0.001). The overall incidence of Gram-negative pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low, but higher in HCAP and ICP patients than CAP. Empirical treatment was in line with CAP guidelines in 73.5 % of patients with CAP, in 45.5 % of those with HCAP, and in 40 % of those with ICP. The incidence of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was 6.5 % in CAP, 14.4 % in HCAP, and 21.8 % in ICP (p \u003C 0.001). Mortality was highest in ICP (38.6 %) and did not differ between CAP (18.4 %) and HCAP (21.2 %). CONCLUSIONS: HCAP accounts for one-fifth of cases of severe pneumonia in patients admitted to Spanish ICUs. The empirical antibiotic therapy recommended for CAP would be appropriate for 90 % of patients with HCAP in our population, and consequently the decision to include coverage of multidrug-resistant pathogens for HCAP should be cautiously judged in order to prevent the overuse of antimicrobials.

Between\u2010weir gradients in the amplitude of water level fluctuations were reflected in the typical distributions of plants, with a 4\u20136 m elevational range in upper\u2010pool sites, where levels fluctuate most, and a 1\u20131.5 m band in the lower\u2010pool sites, where levels are more stable. Forty\u2010one of 48 species occurred across much of the longitudinal\u00D7elevational site matrix within this cone\u2010shaped distribution, indicating considerable tolerance to flooding and exposure; this was especially apparent for Phragmites australis, Cyperus spp. and Centipeda spp. The 41 species were represented in seven of nine water\u2010regime groups identified by cluster analysis. The remainder, found within \u00B11 m of the water surface in lower\u2010pool reaches, were aquatic macrophytes such as Vallisneria americana and Typha spp. and amphibious \u2018mudmats\u2019 such as Glossostigma elatinoides. Water regimes at given sites were measured by the number of days in 2 years flooded to any depth (\u003E0 cm), or to 0\u201330 cm, and by days exposed by \u003E100 cm. Inter\u2010pool differences in the median number of days flooded to \u003E0 cm and 0\u201330 cm were 3\u201330% and \u003C8%, respectively, for all species except Typha spp. but an order of magnitude for the number of days exposed by \u003E100 cm. However, eight of 14 common or representative species analysed showed significant inter\u2010pool differences in the number of days flooded to \u003E0 cm, indicating that sufficient variation exists to necessitate considerable intra\u2010pool replication to allow for the detection of statistical differences in a multi\u2010pool experiment. The practice of maintaining stable weir pool levels limits vegetation processes, e.g. germination, recruitment, decomposition. An increase in the amplitude of river level fluctuations during low flows, from the current 10\u201320 cm range to 20\u201350 cm, would reinstate water regimes suitable to the majority of species surveyed.

We examined cytokine production and phenotypic change after in vitro stimulation of T cells from healthy volunteers using different probiotic strains. Methods: T cells were cultured from colonic biopsies from eight healthy volunteers (Agnholt and Kaltoft, Exp Clin Immunogenet 2001;18:213\u201325), and dendritic cells were matured from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T\u2010cell cultures were stimulated with autologous bacterial sonicate or strains of Lactobacillus spp., with and without the addition of dendritic cells. Cytokine levels (TNF\u2010\u03B1, IFN\u2010\u03B3, IL\u201010 and GM\u2010CSF) and phenotype (CD3, CD4, CD25 and CD69) were measured on day 4. Results: Lactobacillus spp. induced higher productions of TNF\u2010\u03B1 and IL\u201010 than did autologous bacteria. In presence of dendritic cells, the production of all cytokines increased. However, the increases of IFN\u2010\u03B3 and TNF\u2010\u03B1 were more pronounced in wells with autologous bacteria than in wells with Lactobacillus spp. The addition of dendritic cells upregulated CD25 expression without simultaneous upregulation of CD69. The upregulation was pronounced after stimulation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG compared with autologous bacteria and other lactobacilli. Discussion: In presence of dendritic cells, autologous bacteria induced inflammatory cytokines, while probiotics mainly induced regulatory cytokines. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG induced a regulatory phenotype (cd25(\u002B)), in part mediated by dendritic cells. Future studies will address whether this shift to a CD25(\u002B) phenotype represents a differentiation into competent regulatory T cells. In a clinical context, such cells might be used for treatment of inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hvas, C.

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori in patients with end\u2010stage renal disease (ESRD), receiving long\u2010term haemodialysis treatment. Methods: This study included 40 sera from patients with ESRD (29 male and 11 female) undergoing periodic haemodialysis; mean time of treatment was 42.6 months. Using ELISA technique, we investigated the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against H. pylori as well as IgG CagA (antibodies specific for CagA(\u002B) strains of H. pylori). Sera from 40 healthy blood donors were used as a control group. Results: H. pylori IgG antibodies were detected in 32 out of 40 (80%) patients in the dialysis group, while 31/40 (77.5%) tested positive for IgA. IgG CagA antibodies were present in 13 out of 40 (32.5%). Prevalence of H. pylori IgG, IgA and CagA IgG antibodies in the control group was 33, 7 and 15%, respectively. Conclusions: Although international data suggest that prevalence of H. pylori infection is the same in ESRD patients as in healthy individuals, in our study that seems not to be the case. The higher blood and gastric juice urea levels may be a risk factor (among many others), but more studies are required in order to understand the relation of H. pylori infection in this group of patients.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Astrinidou\u2010Vakaloudi, A.; Xytsas, S.; Diamanti, I.; .

High amounts of nitric oxide (NO) released by activated macrophages induce tumour cell death. Therefore, we explored the capacity of AE to modulate NO\u2010mediated antitumour response in vitro. Interestingly, while AE markedly suppressed NO release from macrophages alone, it significantly potentiated NO production in cocultures of macrophages and C6 cells, after 48 h of cultivation. Accordingly, the viability of C6 cells cocultivated with macrophages was reduced in the presence of AE. Moreover, the observed AE\u2010imposed potentiation of NO production in macrophages was closely related to macrophage culture cell density.

The pathogenesis of AE is not fully understood. A combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors like microorganisms seems to contribute to the symptoms. The yeast Malassezia sympodialis is part of our normal skin micro flora but can act as an allergen and elicit specific IgE and T\u2010cell reactivity in patients with AE. Recently, we identified a novel major M. sympodialis allergen, designated Mala s 11 (22.4 kDa), with sequence similarity to the mitochondrial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Interestingly, Mala s 11 has a high degree of homology to human MnSOD. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of recombinant Mala s 11 on antigen\u2010presenting dendritic cells. Monocyte\u2010derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from healthy blood donors were cultured with or without Mala s 11 for different time periods. It was found that the maturation marker CD83 and the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were upregulated on the MDDCs exposed to Mala s 11 for 24 h, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Furthermore, coculture of MDDCs with Mala s 11 for 9 h induced an increased production of the inflammatory cytokines IL\u20106 (200\u2010fold), TNF\u2010\u03B1 (100\u2010fold) and IL\u20108 (sixfold), as detected by the cytometric bead array (CBA) analysis. Our results suggest that Mala s 11 affects the immune response through DC maturation and production of inflammatory cytokines. The potential cross\u2010reactivity with human MnSOD needs to be explored and the exact role of Mala s 11 in the pathogenesis of AE assessed in clinical studies involving skin prick and atopy patch tests.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vilhelmsson, M.; Ekman, G.

Initially, a time\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent study was carried out to find the optimal stimulation conditions for the TNF\u2010\u03B1 response.

B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells and endothelial cells express ICOSL. Inducible costimulator (ICOS) interacts with ICOSL, and this interaction leads to signals involved in isotype switching and the development of immunological memory. Hitherto, no polymorphisms of this gene have been described. The aim of this study was to reveal variation of the ICOSL gene in normal individuals. All eight exons, except exon 1, were sequenced with flanking introns in 10 healthy blood donors. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two length polymorphisms were found. One of the SNPs was found in the coding regions of the gene. The base involved was located in exon 3 and caused a conservative amino acid change from valine (GTT) to isoleucine (ATT). Three individuals were heterozygous G/A for the exon polymorphism, while the remaining seven individuals were homozygous for the wildtype G/G. Exon 3 encodes the immunoglobulin variable (IgV)\u2010like domain of the molecule which is situated outside the cell. This means that the amino acid could be critical for the stability of the molecule or could constitute part of the binding site for ICOS. The results form the basis for further experiments to find possible associations of the alleles to diseases caused by immune dysregulation. Especially, the exon 3 variant is interesting and could play a role for the development of immunological diseases. Besides, it would be interesting to see whether both exon 3 alleles are expressed or only the wildtype allele is functional.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobsen, K.; Ohm\u2010Laursen, L.; Barington, T.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf016e1e5f839797e311c0f3191e8b974e578f10.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICOSL gene","exon polymorphism","endothelial cells express ICOSL","dendritic cells","B cells","wildtype G","SNPs","alleles","normal individuals","development of immunological diseases","costimulatory molecule","B7","length polymorphisms","Inducible costimulator ligand","development of immunological memory","single nucleotide polymorphisms","conservative amino acid change","heterozygous G","wildtype allele","GTT","valine","monocytes","flanking introns","possible associations","experiments","healthy blood donors","isotype","variation","role","immunoglobulin variable","basis","IgV","isoleucine","domain","interaction","immune dysregulation","coding regions","stability","study","results","signals","ATT","binding site","CD80","variant","aim","CD86","exons","base"],"language":"en"},

Die aussagenlogische Analyse macht also auf der Ebene von Satzbestandteilen halt, die wiederum S\u00E4tze sind. Dabei werden nur solche Teils\u00E4tze als logisch relevante Elemente anerkannt, deren Wahrheitswert einen Einfluss auf den Wahrheitswert des urspr\u00FCnglichen Satzes hat. Im Extremfall ist der einzige solche Teilsatz, aus dem ein gegebener Satz B aufgebaut ist, der Satz B selbst. Dies gilt zum Beispiel f\u00FCr den Satz \u00BBPaul ist w\u00FCtend\u00AB. In solchen F\u00E4llen spricht man allerdings besser davon, der Satz B habe gar keine aussagenlogische Struktur.

Multiplication of HRVs occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. To produce infection, HRVs must first attach to specific cellular receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes. The resulting molecular models are useful to address questions about receptor recognition, binding specificity, and mechanisms by which ICAM-1 induces virus uncoating.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bella, Jordi; Rossmann, Michael G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/840aca7ec71132da88fb88b85456251814c6d445.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICAM","Multiplication of HRVs","percent of HRVs immunogenic variants","combination of crystal structures of HRVs","receptor recognition","cytoplasm","HRV receptor","virus uncoating","receptor intercellular adhesion molecule","plasma membrane","host cell","viral RNA genome","positive RNA strand","cell surface glycoprotein","questions","small viruses","important etiologic agent of common colds","binding specificity","icosahedral protein shell","fragments","electron microscopy reconstructions","specific cellular receptors","processes","mechanisms","delivery","resulting molecular models","complexes","striking distance","inflammation response","conformational change","Human rhinoviruses","lipid bilayer","interaction","infection"],"language":"en"},

Apes are susceptible to many of the same diseases as humans and other nonhuman primates. Trauma and infectious diseases, such as Ebola, respiratory infections and parasitism affect apes in range countries. Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are also important in wild as well as captive populations. Degenerative diseases of older age, especially cardiovascular disease and renal disease, are more important in zoo-housed apes than in their wild counterparts. Infections described only in zoo-housed apes include coccidiodomycosis, tularemia, dysentery due to balantidiasis, and systemic amoebiasis due to balamuthia. Those reported only in apes in range countries include yaws, leprosy, Ebola, anthrax-like bacillary septicemia, and gapeworms.","publish_time":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lowenstine, Linda J.; McManamon, Rita; Terio, Karen A.","journal":"Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19a87b98a58d1a2e35794e965dffd5164c4223c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["great apes","zoo-housed apes","understanding diseases","infectious diseases","respiratory infections","chapter highlights diseases","Ebola","Degenerative diseases of older age","range countries","gastrointestinal infections","cardiovascular disease","renal disease","wild counterparts","free-living populations","captive populations","gibbons","yaws","parasitism","anthrax","gorillas","dysentery","chimpanzees","bonobos","leprosy","tularemia","coccidiodomycosis","balantidiasis","bacillary septicemia","conservation","systemic amoebiasis","orangutans","emphasis","humans","nonhuman primates","balamuthia"],"language":"en"},

The SARS coronavirus genome encodes for proteins that are common to all members of the coronavirus, i.e. replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) and structural proteins (spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope), as well as eight accessory proteins. The accessory proteins have been designated as open reading frames (ORF) 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b, and they do not show significant homology to viral proteins of other known coronaviruses. Epidemiological studies have revealed that the part of the viral genome that encodes for ORF8a and ORF8b showed major variations and the animal isolates contain an additional 29-nucleotide sequence which is absent in most of the human isolates. As a result, ORF8a and ORF8b in the human isolates become one ORF, termed ORF8ab. In this chapter, we will discuss the genetic variation in the ORF8 region, expression of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab during infection, cellular localization and posttranslational modification of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab, participation of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab in viral\u2013viral interactions, their effects on other viral proteins and impact on viral replication and/or pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keng, Choong-Tat; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83494d320178b98a3ffb6128b8833c3ffe5972e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","ORF8b","viral genome","accessory proteins","viral replication","viral interactions","structural proteins","expression of ORF8a","participation of ORF8a","termed ORF8ab","human isolates","posttranslational modification of ORF8a","SARS coronavirus genome","animal isolates","novel coronavirus","infection","global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","cellular localization","spike","pp1b","pp1a","effects","ORF8 region","aetiological agent","membrane","major variations","impact","replicase polyproteins","genetic variation","nucleocapsid","open reading frames","members","nucleotide sequence","significant homology","known coronaviruses","envelope","beginning","pathogenesis","result","Epidemiological studies","century","chapter"],"language":"en"},

At the beginning of the 20th century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.). Thanks to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (by Paul Ehrlich) and antibiotics (by Sir Alexander Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimised. Large scale vaccination programmes against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough and polio), started in the early 1950s, raised hopes of finally being able to eradicate these diseases from the planet.","publish_time":"2011-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verhoef, Jan; van Kessel, Kok; Snippe, Harm","journal":"Principles of Immunopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bafa2173dd5ac540e0d606352a73db4d29527cde.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Paul Ehrlich","Alexander Fleming"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["childhood diseases","threat of infectious diseases","diphtheria","century","PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS","active vaccination procedures","Large scale vaccination programmes","antibiotics","Paul Ehrlich","whooping cough","question","discovery of antimicrobial chemicals","Sir Alexander Fleming","polio","number","prevention","rabies","proper hygienic means","hopes","Thanks","time","tetanus","beginning","Effective treatment","middle","planet"],"language":"en"},

The viruses spread and replicate under the following conditions: (1) the viruses enter the human body and duplicate there; (2) the viruses cause diseases; and (3) the viruses can easily spread from person to person. The H1N1 influenza viruses replicate is within only respiratory epithelial cells. The virus entering into the cells causes complex pathological changes of the cells.

All transfusions offer benefits, and the clinician must comprehend the possible adverse events, especially those related to TRALI, which continues to be the most common cause of transfusion-related death reported to FDA, with TACO as the second most-commonly reported event. Transfusing in the setting of hemorrhagic blood loss adds additional challenges regarding volume overload, coagulopathy, and optimum transfusion ratios of red cells, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. The information imparted in this chapter will help equip the clinician with the knowledge needed to make the best decisions for patients requiring blood products, especially injured patients.","publish_time":"2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"West, F.

Extracellular entities are coated in antibody and cleared by antibody- and complement-mediated mechanisms. Parasitic worms are prevented from anchoring in the host by IgA and IgE antibodies. IgE triggers mast cell, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and the release of toxic mediators. Intracellular bacteria and parasites as well as viruses are eliminated by CTLs, NK cells, NKT cells and \u03B3\u03B4 T cells secreting cytotoxic cytokines and/or carrying out target cell cytolysis. Macrophage hyperactivation and granuloma formation may be triggered to confine persistent invaders. Th1 and Th17 responses support cell-mediated immunity against internal threats, whereas Th2 responses support humoral immunity against external threats.

One potential mechanism by which these microorganisms may cause PPROM is by increasing the concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the membranes and amniotic fluid. We tested this hypothesis in a well\u2010defined model system of genital infection with M. pulmonis, a natural reproductive pathogen of rats. METHOD OF STUDY: Timed\u2010pregnant, specific pathogen\u2010free, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were infected with 10(7) CFU M. pulmonis at gestation day (gd) 14. Controls received an equivalent volume (100 \u03BCL) of sterile medium. At gd 18, rats were euthanized, and membranes and amniotic fluids were harvested and stored at \u221270\u00B0C until analysis. Proteinase activity of amniotic fluid and membranes was resolved on discontinuous 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gelatin zymography gels. Band intensity was determined using a digital gel documentation system and the manufacturer\u0027s software (Kodak). RESULTS: Gelatinolytic activity associated with a band similar in molecular weight to ProMMP\u20109 (92 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP\u20109) was significantly increased in amniotic fluids and membranes harvested from M. pulmonis\u2010treated pups at gd 18 when compared with tissues harvested from control pups. Both ProMMP\u20109 and ProMMP\u20102 (72 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP\u20102) were increased in infected animals at gd 21. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the genital mycoplasmas can increase MMP\u20109 production in vivo.","publish_time":"2007-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peltier, Morgan R.; Barney, Brandon M.; Brown, Mary B.","journal":"Am J Reprod Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33020c2cf6e00ec7bf227a68a5889888e298abe0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kodak"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gd","pulmonis","ProMMP","amniotic fluids","genital mycoplasmas","premature rupture of membranes","inactive precursor of MMP","Proteinase activity of amniotic fluid","PPROM","kDa","Dawley rats","well\u2010defined model system of genital infection","natural reproductive pathogen of rats","digital gel documentation system","specific pathogen","band similar","Gelatinolytic activity","Band intensity","METHOD OF STUDY","treated pups","control pups","infected animals","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gelatin zymography gels","sodium dodecyl sulfate","Ureaplasma parvum","manufacturer\u0027s software","Mycoplasma hominis","Sprague","MMPs","\u03BCL","molecular weight","gestation day","concentration of matrix metalloproteinases","dire pregnancy outcome","equivalent volume","PROBLEM","microorganisms","hypothesis","Kodak","CFU","tissues","sterile medium","potential mechanism","Controls","urealyticum","RESULTS","production","analysis","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally conceptualized as a type of political risk experienced by multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in conflictive areas, terrorism has evolved in recent years. The global terrorist networks that dominate the international scene today have different motivations, strategies, tactics, and organizational structures than their secular and ethnic\u2010separatist predecessors and these differences matter for IB theory and practice. Moreover, these groups have shown themselves adaptive, resilient, and capable of striking targets of strategic and symbolic importance in global business and financial centers. This paper examines the changing nature of the terrorist threat to MNEs and the implications for a sector that has been a target of recent attacks: the luxury hotel industry. Structured as a case study of Marriott International, a leading global hospitality provider, the paper analyzes ways the firm is adapting to the evolving threat and the measures it has introduced to safeguard guests, staff, property, and brand.

Moreover, it is now widely held that the pathophysiologic mechanisms causing nasal allergy contribute, or predispose many individuals, to the development of other airway diseases, including asthma. Allergic rhinitis may well be a factor in 24% of children with otitis media with effusion (OME), and perhaps 28% of cases of chronic sinusitis. As many as 78% of persons with asthma aged 15 to 30 years have elevated serum IgE antibodies to five common aeroallergens. In many instances, nasal allergy signals the presence of more severe disease. Considerable evidence now suggests that early and appropriate intervention can improve the quality of life and productivity of patients with allergic rhinitis, enhance the academic performance of children, and reduce the prevalence of airway complications. The goal of treatment has shifted from mere symptom alleviation to blocking the pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause chronic allergic inflammation and leave patients vulnerable to airway infections. The earlier in a patient\u0027s life that this can be accomplished, the better the anticipated consequences. A panel of experts was convened in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on 2 September 1996, to explore these issues and their impact on allergy prevention and treatment in primary care.

Information was retrieved through key words and key questions covering the stability and degradation of ncRNAs after oral ingestion, the passage of ncRNAs from food and feed to human and animal organs and tissues via the gastrointestinal tract and other barriers, as well as the potential effects on the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system or the entire organism.Full description of the strategy used for the literature search and for studies selectionis provided and the number of retrieved publications is reported. This report is divided into four partsdiscussing the kinetics of exogenous ncRNAs in humans and animals, with focus on ingested ncRNAs (Part 1); the possible effects of ncRNAs on the gastrointestinal tract (Part 2), systemically(Part 3)and on the immune system (Part 4). This report suggests that some plant ncRNAs (e.g miRNAs and siRNAs) show higher stability as compared to other ncRNAs due to peculiar chemical characteristics (2\u2019\u2010O\u2010methylation at 3\u2019 end).However, ingested or administered ncRNA must overcome many extracellular and cellular barriers to reach the intended target tissue or functional location in sufficient amount to exert any biological effect. Literature data indicate that chemically unmodified and unformulated ncRNAs exhibit very low stability in the gastrointestinal tract and in biological fluids and, in general, do not elicit major biological effects.This report also provides an overview of the RNA content in plant\u2010derived foods and diets and discusses the controversies on the presence of dietary exogenous RNAs in the biological fluids of humans and animals and their effects.

A toxoid vaccine for use in sows has been developed and studied in field trials. The European Pharmacopoeia Monograph on vaccines for use in animals lays down a method of the efficacy testing based on the immunization of rabbits, the collection of pooled sera and the subsequent assay of anti\u2010toxin antibodies in mice using an appropriate test toxin. The vaccine is regarded as effective if it induces a minimum of 10 IU of \u03B2\u2010anti\u2010toxin per ml of rabbit serum. We have established a range of 17.14\u201398.23 IU \u03B2\u2010anti\u2010toxin per ml rabbit serum induced by a sample of C. perfringens toxoid vaccine. The vaccine has been used under field conditions in different rearing units at the same time, mostly in the form of emergency vaccinations following the outbreak of disease. The outcome of vaccination was evaluated by recording the total numbers of piglets born alive and the piglet losses. Use of the vaccine, coupled with other measures, resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in the number of losses.","publish_time":"2006-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Springer, S; Selbitz, H.\u2010J","journal":"FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0eed4509faf6b54de87a76f754333bce7fd8012.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use","perfringens toxoid vaccine","IU of \u03B2","IU \u03B2","appropriate test toxin","subsequent assay of anti\u2010toxin antibodies","rabbit serum","piglet losses","outbreak of disease","different rearing units","sucking piglets","field conditions","number of losses","field trials","Clostridium perfringens type","total numbers of piglets","mice","serious problem","collection of pooled sera","primary causal agent","vaccines","sample of","immunization of rabbits","high morbidity","decisive role","European Pharmacopoeia Monograph","form of emergency vaccinations","method","animals","time","mortality","efficacy testing","Necrotic enteritis","pathogenesis","minimum","sows","reduction","range","outcome of vaccination","measures"],"language":"en"},

Total genetic variance of a species consists of within population genetic diversity, and the differences found among populations; both types of variance should be maintained to maximize adaptive flexibility of endangered fishes. Forces that erode genetic variation include small population size, population bottlenecks, genetic drift, inbreeding depression, artificial selection in captivity, and mixing of distinct genetic stocks. These can lead to increased homozygosity, loss of quantitative variation, and exposure of deleterious recessive alleles, all of which may reduce fitness.

In order to investigate these taxonomic relationships, we sequenced the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene of Pfiesteria piscicida (Steidinger et Burkholder), a Pfiesteria\u2010like dinoflagellate, Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., and Amyloodinium ocellatum (Brown) and submitted those sequences to GenBank. Pfiesteria piscicida and Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp. are heterotrophic dinoflagellates, purportedly pathogenic to fish, and A. ocellatum, a major fish pathogen, has caused extensive economic losses in both the aquarium and aquaculture industries. The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria\u2010like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P. piscicda. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full\u2010length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., P. piscicida, and the Pfiesteria\u2010like dinoflagellate are closely related and group into the class Blastodiniphyceae, as does A. ocellatum. None of the species examined were closely related to the apicomplexans or to Perkinsus marinus, the parasite that causes \u201CDermo disease\u201D in oysters. The overall phylogenetic analyses largely supported the current class and subclass groupings within the dinoflagellates.","publish_time":"2002-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Litaker, R.

DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: \u201Ccommunity\u2010acquired pneumonia\u201D AND \u201Cchild\u201D AND \u201Cetiology\u201D OR \u201Cdiagnosis\u201D OR \u201Cseverity\u201D OR \u201Cantibiotic\u201D. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community\u2010acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation \u2264 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community\u2010acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X\u2010ray and serum procalcitonin \u003C 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77\u201098%) and 93% (90\u201099%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation \u003C 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients.

Even this is complicated, as it is impossible to generalize with this virus, due to marked differences in the biologic behavior of the myriad virus strains, plus the marked effects of a large number of host factors. It is now known that the MHV group is represented by numerous variants that are constantly mutating, and that these viruses can be biologically separated into respiratory (polytropic) MHVs and enterotropic MHVs, with distinctly different patterns of tissue tropism. This dichotomy is emphasized for discussion, but biology is never absolute. Many of the early MHV isolations are made as a result of contamination of biological materials that correlated with their polytropic biologic behavior. Their stated tropisms frequently were the result of the investigators\u0027 research interests and many have therefore been subjected to selective passage that favors a particular tissue tropism. All MHV isolates are related genetically and antigenically, but isolates can be differentiated by genetic sequencing, cross-serum neutralization, or with monoclonal antibodies. Genetic and antigenic relationships are not predictive of biologic behavior.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"W. Barthold, Stephen; L.

The picornaviral 3C proteinases constitute an ideal target for the rational design of antiviral drugs. The chapter discusses the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases, which constitute a unique class of enzymes with a distinct substrate specificity, and are so far only found in \u002BRNA viruses. Within these viruses the 3C proteinases perform a central and indispensable role during the viral life cycle and 3C proteinase inhibitors have the potential to limit the spread of viral infections. The chapter concludes that there is a wealth of experimental information available for the best-studied examples of the viruses of the Picornaviridae. This information provides an opportunity to design inhibitors against the viral 3C proteinase. Effective inhibitors of the picornaviral 3C proteinase have the potential to become effective antiviral drugs against human diseases such as the common cold, HAV, enteroviral infections, and diseases caused by related \u002B RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bergmann, Ernst M.; James, Michael N.G.","journal":"Proteases of Infectious Agents","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C proteinases","C proteinase inhibitors","RNA viruses","chapter","Effective inhibitors","potential","effective antiviral drugs","cysteine proteinases","spread of viral infections","picornaviral","rational design of antiviral drugs","viral life cycle","human diseases","enteroviral infections","proteolytic enzymes","family picornaviridae","unique class of enzymes","wealth of experimental information available","indispensable role","ideal target","HAV","best","distinct substrate specificity","examples","chymotrypsin","opportunity"],"language":"en"},

One is required to culture exponentially growing ES cells on the inactivated PEFs with changes of culture medium once or twice a day. Carry out subculturing of the ES cells every 2 days by a 1:4 split. Trypsinize ES cells and remove excess trypsin quickly. Add 3 ml of ES medium to inactivate the trypsin and dissociate the cells into a single-cell suspension by gentle pipetting. Plate them on a new gelatin-coated 60-mm culture dish. Use the automatic operation switch to initiate AC followed by DC. AC is utilized to induce an inhomogeneous or divergent electric field, resulting in cell alignment and pearl chain formation.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tada, Masako; Tada, Takashi","journal":"Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155568/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Trypsinize ES","AC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hybrid cells","growing ES cells","Trypsinize ES cells","pluripotential stem cells","nuclear programming of somatic cells","ES medium","cell hybridization","cell alignment","chapter","changes of culture medium","culture dish","single-cell suspension","excess trypsin","use of virus","inactivated PEFs","electrofusion","divergent electric field","practical procedure","pearl chain formation","gentle pipetting","automatic operation switch","chemicals","days","new gelatin","Plate","DC","subculturing","split"],"language":"en"},

The biomedical literature contains numerous reports of zoonotic diseases and parasitic infestations from laboratory mice and their wild counterparts. The extended maintenance of the laboratory mouse over a number of generations under controlled and increasingly sophisticated laboratory animal housing conditions with veterinary oversight and effective infection control measures has markedly reduced the likelihood that zoonotic agents would be encountered in a modem animal care and use environment. Wild caught mice that are maintained in naturalistic housing environments in the laboratory, laboratory mice that have contact with wild or feral mice, and mice kept as pets in the home environment are examples of animal management conditions that would be conducive to the expression and transmission of zoonotic diseases and other mouse-associated hazards. In addition to the zoonoses, mice are capable of inflicting bites on inadequately trained personnel and are a rich source of allergens for a substantial number of persons predisposed to develop mouse-associated allergic sensitivities. This chapter discusses the mouse-associated zoonotic diseases and other health hazards and explains the strategies that are helpful for reducing or eliminating the risk of personnel exposure to these conditions.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"E.

Negative staining with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) or uranyl acetate has facilitated the detection of many viruses in clinical specimens. Enhancement procedures have included the use of centrifugation and agar diffusion for concentrating virus particles, the use of solid phase capture reagents to trap virus particles and the use of secondary antibodies and electron dense markers to help visualize them. Techniques currently in use and employing negative staining include direct EM, immune electron microscopy (IEM), solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM), colloidal gold-labeled protein A (PAG), solid phase IEM employing a second decorator antibody (SPIEMDAT), and solid phase IEM using colloided gold-labeled secondary antibodies (SPEIMDAGT). IEM methods assist with the detection of small viruses or viruses present in low numbers while PAG offers increased sensitivity over direct EM and IEM. In our experience the serum-in-agar (SIA) method is the most sensitive of the PAG IEM techniques for detection of rotavirus particles in clinical specimens. SPIEMDAT enhances the detection of small viruses which are often missed by other techniques due to background staining in specimens. SPEIMDAGT employing colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody has increased sensitivity and offers the advantage of detecting viral antigen when whole virus particles are not visible. IEM techniques have recently been used for typing viruses using either monospecific antisera or monoclonal antibodies and colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody.","publish_time":"2002-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahony, James B.; Chernesky, Max A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAG","PAG IEM","SPIEMDAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["solid phase IEM","PAG IEM techniques","IEM methods","detection of small viruses","use of secondary antibodies","colloidal gold","secondary antibody","negative staining","solid phase immune electron microscopy","detection of rotavirus particles","use of solid phase capture reagents","concentrating virus particles","use of centrifugation","colloided gold","background staining","clinical specimens","direct EM","monoclonal antibodies","increased sensitivity","decorator antibody","SPIEMDAT","SPEIMDAGT","electron dense markers","agar diffusion","low numbers","PTA","phosphotungstic acid","monospecific antisera","good candidates","uranyl acetate","SIA","unique morphology","viral antigen","protein","serum","advantage","Enhancement procedures","experience"],"language":"en"},

Malignant tumors caused by esophageal cancer, and the relationship to environmental factors has been the focus of many public health studies.

We employed two datasets, including a national investigation of esophageal cancer rates and distribution, and national water quality grades in China\u2019s primary rivers and lakes. Esophageal cancer data were grouped based on different water quality grades, which included a scaled buffer distance from rivers and lakes.

It is vital, therefore, that stringent measures are taken to counter acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Following a diplomatic conference, held in Beijing from 30 August to 10 September 2010 under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, representatives from more than 80 States adopted two international air law instruments for the suppression of unlawful acts relating to civil aviation. The two instruments are the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation and the Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. The Beijing Convention serves international civil aviation well, by requiring parties to criminalize a number of new and emerging threats to the safety of civil aviation, including using aircraft as a weapon and organizing, directing and financing acts of terrorism. These new treaties reflect the international community\u2019s shared effort to prevent acts of terrorism against civil aviation and to prosecute and punish those who would commit them. The treaties promote cooperation between States while emphasizing the human rights and fair treatment of terrorist suspects. The Convention also obligates States to criminalize the transport of biological, chemical, nuclear weapons and related material. However, many provisions of the Convention, which is a new comer to aviation security in the context of some new provisions it introduces, need interpretation. This article discusses the areas in the treaty which need interpretation and clarity.","publish_time":"2011-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abeyratne, Ruwantissa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f5266d81f3e8ed0bfead893e5853acf7ee416cb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Civil Aviation Organization","Unlawful Acts Relating","International Civil Aviation","Convention"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["safety of civil aviation","International Civil Aviation Organization","aviation security","suppression of unlawful acts","Beijing Convention","States","new treaties","new provisions","counter acts of unlawful interference","financing acts of terrorism","Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft","new comer","number of new","international air law instruments","international community\u2019s shared effort","interpretation","global economy","important global business","chemical","human rights","significant driver","nuclear weapons","emerging threats","Protocol Supplementary","fair treatment of terrorist suspects","context","representatives","transport of biological","related material","treaty","stringent measures","parties","auspices","areas","cooperation","article","diplomatic conference","clarity"],"language":"en"},

It addresses the most relevant health and welfare problems and reviews their potential hazards and associated risk factors. Regarding health, problems related to post weaning diarrhoea, cold stress, skin lesions, endoparasites and post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome are described. Reasons for distress and frustration in weaned piglets are identified as mainly separation from the mother, a new environment, mixing and fear of humans. Finally, hazards and risk factors for health and welfare in organic weaners are related to animal characteristics, housing systems, feed/nutrition and management. Generally, it is concluded that diseases around weaning are multifactorial in nature, with several factors contributing simultaneously as stressors at the time of weaning. In order to solve problems around weaning, the complexity and the individuality of farm systems need to be taken into account.","publish_time":"2013-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leeb, Christine; Hegelund, Lene; Edwards, Sandra; Mejer, Helena; Roepstorff, Allan; Rousing, Tine; Sundrum, Albert; Bonde, Marianne","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f94acdd84030c6f0c6ab3f611caa03623f17960c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149107/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weaning diarrhoea","weaning multisystemic","time of weaning","welfare problems","different health","relevant health","animal welfare issues","associated risk factors","animal characteristics","organic pigs","organic weaners","housing systems","potential hazards","individuality of farm systems","endoparasites","skin lesions","feed","cold stress","complexity","weaned piglets","available information","new environment","separation","distress","frustration","nutrition","relation","nature","mother","Reasons","management","diseases","syndrome","stressors"],"language":"en"},

Skewed distributions of key epidemiological parameters of the virus and patient care are a challenge for the control of the outbreak as well as keeping the system functional. METHODS: The skewed parameters\u2014pre-patency period, incubation period, duration of viral shedding and time to admission to hospital\u2014are analyzed in regard to their impact and possible countermeasures. RESULTS: The skewed distributions are exclusively time related variables. They are a handicap for outbreak control as well patient management. Optimization between residual open flanks and the efforts to close them is difficult. The main stakeholders are the local health departments, the diagnostic laboratories, the health care infrastructure and finally the citizens in regard to the burden due to non-pharmaceutical interventions including quarantine and isolation. The duration of quarantine and isolation should urgently be shortened for health care workers (HCW) as well as people in critical infrastructure by ready (re-) testing. Calculated risks have to be taken within a phase 3 of a pandemic to keep a system going. CONCLUSIONS: The skewed distributions are a special challenge for infectious disease control.

The impression that viral infections dominate is strengthened if the abundance of subclinical virus infections is considered, in particular those in children. The most serious medical consequences of viral pneumonia are encountered in the old, the newborn, or the patient with a circulatory or respiratory handicap. Influenza is a cause of increased mortality among the old, while RS virus is the most important respiratory virus infection in small children. Fever and a reddened sore throat are among the most common symptoms of infection, and are seen in association with many virus infections. The predominant number of cases of pharyngitis in children and young adults are because of virus infections. Rotavirus is recognized by its characteristic double-layered capsid with cubical symmetry and by its size, 70 nm in diameter. There are rotaviruses of many different animal species, and some have antigenic and biological properties in common with the three human serotypes.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lycke, Erik","journal":"Textbook of Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151927.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151927/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","RS virus","abundance of subclinical virus infections","important respiratory virus infection","small children","viral syndromes","common symptoms of infection","respiratory handicap","serious medical consequences of viral pneumonia","pharyngitis","cubical symmetry","characteristic double-layered capsid","young adults","cause of increased mortality","size","reddened sore throat","patient","predominant number of cases","different animal species","biological properties","rotaviruses","Fever","Influenza","association","human serotypes","nm","diameter","newborn","chapter","impression"],"language":"en"},

Proteases represent the largest segment of the industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in leather and fabric upgrading, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Microbial protease overproducing strains have been developed by conventional screening, mutation/selection strategies and genetic engineering, and wholly new enzymes, with altered specificity or stability have been designed through techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Complete sequencing of the genomes of key Bacillus and Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers and other species of interest has contributed to enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases as well as to production of heterologous proteases. With annual protease sales of about $1.5\u20131.8 billion, proteases account for 60% of the total enzyme market. Detergent proteases, with an annual market of about $1 billion account for the largest protease application segment. Subtilisin Carlsberg and related subtilisin serine proteases represent the first generation of detergent proteases with pH optima of 9\u201310. The second generation, having higher pH optima (10\u201311) and greater temperature stability, is produced from alkalophilic strains including Bacillus clausii and B. halodurans. The third generation consists of detergent proteases whose active sites and/or stability have been modified by protein engineering. The principal applications of proteases in food processing are in brewing, cereal mashing, and beer haze clarification, in the coagulation step in cheese making, in altering the viscoelastic properties of dough in baking and in production of protein hydrolysates. In organic synthesis, proteases have application in synthesis and/or hydrolysis of peptide, ester, and amide bonds involving carboxylic acids and are effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers. Proteases have applications in nutrition as digestive aids and in therapy in thrombosis and cancer treatment. Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity may play significant roles in abnormal physiological functioning as well as in microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions and this has created substantial momentum for development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causing proteases.","publish_time":"2011-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, O.P.","journal":"Comprehensive Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Subtilisin Carlsberg"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteases account","disease-causing proteases","generation of detergent proteases","production of heterologous proteases","principal applications of proteases","related subtilisin serine proteases","enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases","Microbial protease","largest protease application segment","organic synthesis","annual market","industrial enzyme market","total enzyme market","annual protease sales","food processing","development of protease inhibitors","largest segment","production of protein hydrolysates","protein engineering","greater temperature stability","higher pH optima","significant roles","diverse roles","Bacillus clausii","Subtilisin Carlsberg","genetic engineering","alkalophilic strains","directed evolution","Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers","genomes of key Bacillus","abnormal physiological functioning","cereal mashing","therapy","effective tools","carboxylic acids","beer haze clarification","mutation","selection strategies","baking","therapeutic agents","brewing","amide bonds","new enzymes","substantial momentum","digestive aids","thrombosis","ester","conventional screening","species","fabric","nutrition","regulatory aspects of cells","resolution of pairs","coagulation step","hydrolysis of peptide","Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity","active sites","mutagenesis","viral pathophysiological conditions","altered specificity","leather","catalysts","biosystems","viscoelastic properties of dough","Complete sequencing","cheese","cancer treatment","organisms","enantiomers","techniques","halodurans","detergents","therapeutics"],"language":"en"},

The rule of the ROC in Taiwan is outlined as is the position of the United States and the United Nations towards the international status of the ROC and People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in representing the State of China. The chapter then discusses the reforms of the ROC under the Presidency of Lee Teng-hui and the \u201Cspecial state-to-state relationship,\u201D followed by the position of the next President Chen Shui-bian regarding the international status of the ROC.

The only mammals capable of self-powered flying, many can catch insects in complete darkness, using sophisticated echolocation. They are ecologically important in controlling insects, pollinating fruit trees, distributing seeds, and are widely eaten. Many viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites have been isolated from bats. In some cases, direct bat-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Lyssavirus infections transmissible to humans by bats include classic rabies, Duvenhage, European bat lyssaviruses, and Australian bat lyssavirus. Vampire bats (Desmodontinae) transmit classic rabies to humans and domestic animals in Latin America. Insectivorous and frugivorous bats are vectors or reservoirs of at least five Lyssaviruses species, Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg), Henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah), and some other viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Bat-transmitted rabies infections can be prevented by vaccination. Vampire bat rabies can be controlled by vaccinating the bats or killing them with anti-coagulants.","publish_time":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warrell, David A.","journal":"Hunter\u0027s Tropical Medicine and Emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Vampire"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Antarctica","Latin America"],"keyphrases":["species of bats","Vampire bats","Vampire bat rabies","frugivorous bats","classic rabies","direct bat","Bat-transmitted rabies infections","European bat lyssaviruses","Australian bat lyssavirus","Lyssaviruses species","humans","insects","mammalian species","bacteria","fungi","Lyssavirus infections transmissible","domestic animals","Duvenhage","Marburg","Ebola","Desmodontinae","pollinating fruit trees","mammals capable of self-powered flying","Henipaviruses","complete darkness","Latin America","Filoviruses","reservoirs","sophisticated echolocation","Hendra","seeds","Nipah","continents","human transmission","parasites","cases","anti-coagulants","vaccination","Antarctica"],"language":"en"},

Cellular binding and entry by all RV-C, which trigger these episodes, is mediated by the first extracellular domain (EC1) of cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3), a surface cadherin-like protein expressed primarily on the apical surfaces of ciliated airway epithelial cells. Although recombinant EC1 is a potent inhibitor of viral infection, there is no molecular description of this protein or its binding site on RV-C. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (EM) data resolving the EC1 and EC1\u002B2 domains of human CDHR3 complexed with viral isolate C15a. Structure-suggested residues contributing to required interfaces on both EC1 and C15a were probed and identified by mutagenesis studies with four different RV-C genotypes. In contrast to most other rhinoviruses, which bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptors via a capsid protein VP1-specific fivefold canyon feature, the CDHR3 EC1 contacts C15a, and presumably all RV-Cs, in a unique cohesive footprint near the threefold vertex, encompassing residues primarily from viral protein VP3, but also from VP1 and VP2. The EC1\u002B2 footprint on C15a is similar to that of EC1 alone but shows that steric hindrance imposed by EC2 would likely prevent multiprotein binding by the native receptor at any singular threefold vertex. Definition of the molecular interface between the RV-Cs and their receptors provides new avenues that can be explored for potential antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yingyuan; Watters, Kelly; Hill, Marchel G; Fang, Qianglin; Liu, Yue; Kuhn, Richard J; Klose, Thomas; Rossmann, Michael G; Palmenberg, Ann C","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921640117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant EC1","RV-Cs","CDHR3 EC1 contacts C15a","viral protein VP3","different RV-C genotypes","cadherin-related protein","viral isolate C15a","Rhinovirus-C","receptors","multiprotein binding","Cellular binding","binding site","potent inhibitor of viral infection","capsid protein VP1-specific fivefold canyon feature","domains of human CDHR3","singular threefold vertex","molecular interface","molecular description","surface cadherin","unique cohesive footprint","Structure-suggested residues","EM","native receptor","apical surfaces of ciliated airway epithelial cells","present cryo-electron microscopy","intercellular adhesion molecule","data","rhinoviruses","EC2","mutagenesis studies","interfaces","entry","new avenues","species of Picornaviridae Enterovirus","steric hindrance","extracellular domain","childhood asthma exacerbations","potential antiviral therapies","Definition","contrast","VP2","episodes"],"language":"en"},

The magnitude of the impact of this public health emergency on the care of patients with DBMD is unclear as they are suspected of having an increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. In this paper, the authors discuss their consensus recommendations pertaining to care of these patients during the pandemic. We address issues surrounding corticosteroid and exon skipping treatments, cardiac medications, hydroxychloroquine use, emergency/respiratory care, rehabilitation management, and the conduct of clinical trials.

Although the pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial, growing evidence has demonstrated that gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to the development of UC. Lizhong decoction (LZD), a well-known classical Chinese herbal prescription, has been used to clinically treat UC for long time, but its mechanism is not clear. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combining with untargeted metabolomics profiling was used to investigate how LZD worked. Results indicated that LZD could shape the gut microbiota structure and modify metabolic profiles. The abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Enterobacter, and Escherichia-Shigella correlated with intestinal inflammation markedly decreased, while the levels of beneficial bacteria including Blautia, Muribaculaceae_norank, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and Ruminiclostridium 9 elevated in various degrees. Additionally, fecal metabolite profiles reflecting microbial activities showed that adenosine, lysoPC(18:0), glycocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid notably decreased, while cholic acid, \u03B1-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, and L-tryptophan significantly increased after LZD treatment. Hence, based on the systematic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics of gut flora, the results provided a novel insight that microbiota and its metabolites might be potential targets for revealing the mechanism of LZD on amelioration of UC.Key Points \u2022 The potential mechanism of LZD on the amelioration of UC was firstly investigated.\u2022 LZD could significantly shape the structure of gut microbiota.\u2022 LZD could notably modulate the fecal metabolic profiling of UC mice.

Purpose To report abdominal imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from 3/27/2020 to 4/10/2020 who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed and salient findings recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results 412 patients (average age 57 years; range 18-\u003E90 years; 241 men, 171 women) were evaluated. 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiographs, n=137; ultrasound, n=44; CT, n=42; MRI, n=1) in 134 patients (33%). Abdominal imaging was associated with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per year increase, p=0.001) and ICU admission (OR 17.3, p\u003C0.001). Bowel wall abnormalities were seen on 31% of CT scans (13 of 42) and were associated with ICU admission (OR 15.5, p=0.01). Bowel findings included pneumatosis or portal venous gas, seen on 20% of CT scans in ICU patients (4 of 20). Surgical correlation (n=4) revealed unusual yellow discoloration of bowel (n=3) and bowel infarction (n=2). Pathology demonstrated ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis and fibrin thrombi in arterioles (n=2). Of right upper quadrant ultrasounds, 87% (32 of 37) were performed for liver laboratory findings, and 54% (20 of 37) demonstrated a dilated sludge-filled gallbladder suggestive of cholestasis. Patients with a cholecystostomy tube placed (n=4) had negative bacterial cultures. Conclusion Bowel abnormalities and cholestasis were common findings on abdominal imaging of inpatients with COVID-19. Patients who went to laparotomy often had ischemia, possibly due to small vessel thrombosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhayana, Rajesh; Som, Avik; Li, Matthew D; Carey, Denston E; Anderson, Mark A; Blake, Michael A; Catalano, Onofrio; Gee, Michael S; Hahn, Peter F; Harisinghani, Mukesh; Kilcoyne, Aoife; Lee, Susanna I; Mojtahed, Amirkasra; Pandharipande, Pari V; Pierce, Theodore T; Rosman, David A; Saini, Sanjay; Samir, Anthony E; Simeone, Joseph F; Gervais, Debra A; Velmahos, George; Misdraji, Joseph; Kambadakone, Avinash","journal":"Radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020201908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bowel findings","ICU patients","abdominal imaging findings","Abdominal imaging studies","abdominal imaging of inpatients","small bowel","abdominal viscera","bowel infarction","common findings","salient findings","Conclusion Bowel abnormalities","Bowel wall abnormalities","ICU admission","CT scans","liver laboratory findings","unusual yellow discoloration of bowel","target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","years","COVID","average age","gallbladder suggestive of cholestasis","small vessel thrombosis","patchy necrosis","fibrin thrombi","lung","ischemic enteritis","ACE2","arterioles","pneumatosis","vasculature","radiographs","retrospective cross-sectional study","portal venous gas","Methods","Pathology","highest surface expression","range","dilated sludge","single quaternary care center","Medical records","clinical data","Univariable analysis","logistic regression","right upper quadrant ultrasounds","Background Angiotensin","enzyme","Materials","ischemia","odds ratio","injury","Results","cholecystostomy tube","Purpose","MRI","negative bacterial cultures","year increase","women","laparotomy","Surgical correlation"],"language":"en"},

We isolated a highly virulent IBV strain (CK/CH/JS/TAHY) from kidneys of diseased chickens. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/JS/TAHY clustered with the QX-like type. The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect.

Current guidelines for CVT management support the initial use of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by longer-term oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA). There has been increasing, albeit limited, evidence for the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) as an alternative to VKA. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared the safety and efficacy of DOACs to VKA in treating CVT. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register using a suitable keyword/MeSH term search strategy. All studies published in English comparing outcomes of patients with CVT treated with DOAC or VKA were included. In total, 6 studies (5 observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial) comprising 412 patients (age range 16-83 years) were analyzed. DOAC was used in 151 patients, while 261 received VKA. The follow-up period was 3-11 months. The efficacy of DOACs was comparable with VKA in terms of partial or full thrombus recanalization (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.16) and excellent functional recovery with modified Rankin scale \u003C 2 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.13). Patients treated with DOAC developed lower major bleeding events when compared to VKA, although this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12-1.59).

MATERIAL \u0026 METHODS Twenty adult patients with slight-moderate chronic periodontitis received periodontal probing using controlled-force electronic probe at 2 visits. In visit 1, a random arch was probed with either a ball-end (0.6mm diameter, 408 kPa; Test) or straight (0.45mm diameter, 726 kPa; Control) probe tip. The opposing arch was then probed using the other probe tip. Discomfort associated with each probing episode was recorded using visual analogue scale (VAS). 7 days later, tip assignments were alternated from visit 1 and VAS re-scored. VAS scores were compared by probe tip, arches and visits. RESULTS Both tips provided similar VAS scores (median 13.5 for ball-end and 14 for straight, p=0.3713). However, the straight tip was associated with decreased VAS scores in the maxilla (p=0.01). Overall, VAS values did not differ by arch or study visit. Individual VAS scores showed high levels of correlation between study visits and between tips used (R2 =0.86 and 0.64, respectively, P\u003C0.0001).

Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a US health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants Case series of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, New York, within the Northwell Health system. The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates. Exposures Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected. Results A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%). At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/minute, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died. Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).

The aim of the study is to elucidate the characteristics and risk factors of late complications associated with TIVAP implantation via the IJV. METHODS The study included 482 patients who underwent TIVAP implantation for long-term chemotherapy and/or nutritional support between April 2012 and December 2017. Most patients (95.2%) had malignant diseases. Events requiring TIVAP removal were defined as TIVAP-related complications. RESULTS The median TIVAP and global follow-ups were 319 days (IQR 152-661) and 218,971 catheter days, respectively. The 3-year cumulative TIVAP availability rate was 70%. There were 44 complications (incidence of 9.1%; 0.201 complications/1000 catheter days). Infectious, catheter-related, and port-related complications occurred in 21, 14, and 9 patients, respectively with infectious complications occurring earlier and more frequently than catheter- and port-related complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that age \u003C 65 years and presence of non-gastrointestinal diseases were significant unfavorable factors for TIVAP-related complications. Patients with 1 and 2 of these factors had an elevated risk (2.2 and 5.4 times, respectively) compared with those without. CONCLUSIONS Among the late complications associated with TIVAP implantation via the IJV, infectious complications occur earlier and more frequently than catheter- and port-related complications. Patients with an age \u003C 65 years and having non-gastrointestinal diseases have a significantly high risk of TIVAP-related complications.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsuruta, Shigeaki; Goto, Yasutomo; Miyake, Hideo; Nagai, Hidemasa; Yoshioka, Yuichiro; Yuasa, Norihiro; Takamizawa, Junichi","journal":"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-019-05122-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31724073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IJV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TIVAP-related complications","infectious complications","port-related complications","TIVAP implantation","catheter-related","TIVAP removal","median TIVAP","risk factors of late complications","patients","high risk of TIVAP","catheter days","IJV","year cumulative TIVAP availability rate","presence of non-gastrointestinal diseases","years","malignant diseases","elevated risk","age","study","significant unfavorable factors","reported results","implantable venous access ports","long-term chemotherapy","global follow-ups","characteristics","internal jugular vein","nutritional support","IQR","PURPOSE","studies","Multivariate analysis","times","Events","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","incidence","aim"],"language":"en"},

As such, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) is empirically recommended until age of toilet training; however, there are limited data to support this. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the existing data and compare UTI rates in infants with asymptomatic VUR on CAP during the first year of life, to those not on CAP. Secondary objectives were to determine associated risk factors with UTI development. METHODS A systematic search of all relevant studies and abstracts was conducted using 4 electronic databases by utilizing appropriate key words by an expert hospital librarian. Eligible studies included children with prenatal hydronephrosis, asymptomatic VUR with or without CAP, and reported on development of UTI in the first year. RESULTS Of 6903 citations screened, 18 were selected, giving a total population of 829 (69.4% male, median age 57 days) who met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were retrospective and of low-quality evidence. Overall, 15.4% of patients developed at least one breakthrough UTI and females had a higher risk of UTI (odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.7).

The present study aimed to analyze the characteristics of severe COVID-19 and identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction. METHODS In total, 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 75 patients with flu were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical parameters were collected from electronic medical records. The disease course was divided into four stages: initial, progression, peak, and recovery stages, according to computed tomography (CT) progress. RESULTS Compared to mild COVID-19, the lymphocytes in the severe COVID-19 progressively decreased at the progression and the peak stages, but rebound in the recovery stage. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the severe group at the initial and progression stages were higher than those in the mild group. Correlation analysis showed that CRP (R=0.62, P\u003C0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (R=0.55, P\u003C0.01) and granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio (R=0.49, P\u003C0.01) were positively associated with the CT severity scores. In contrast, the number of lymphocytes (R=-0.37, P\u003C0.01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID-19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10-1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut-off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS CRP in severe COVID-19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, prior to CT findings. Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of the current study was to explore the intracellular and potent systemic effects of TcdB on human colon epithelial cells utilizing Gene Expression Omnibus and bioinformatic methods. METHODS Two datasets (GSE63880 and GSE29008) were collected to extract data components of mRNA of TcdB-treated human colon epithelial cells; \u0022limma\u0022 package of \u0022R\u0022 software was used to screen the differential genes, and \u0022pheatmap\u0022 package was applied to construct heat maps for the differential genes; Metascape website was utilized for protein-protein interaction network and Molecular Complex Detection analysis, and Genome Ontology (GO) was used to analyze the selected differential genes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to validate the expression of hub genes. RESULTS GO terms involved in DNA replication and cell cycle were identified significantly enriched in TcdB-treated human colon epithelial cells. Moreover, the decreased expression of DNA replication-related genes, MCM complex, and CDC45 in C. difficile (TcdA-/TcdB\u002B)-infected Caco-2 cells were validated via qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the integrated analysis of different gene expression datasets allowed us to identify a set of genes and GO terms underlying the mechanisms of CDI induced by TcdB.

This multicenter, propensity score-matched study was performed to assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic caudate lobectomy (LCL). METHODS A multicenter retrospective study was performed including all patients who underwent LCL and open caudate lobectomy (OCL) in four institutions from January 2013 to December 2018. In total, 131 patients were included in this study and divided into LCL (n = 19) and OCL (n = 112) groups. LCLs were matched to OCLs (1:2) using a propensity score matching (PSM) based on nine preoperative variables, including patient demographics and tumor characteristics. The pathological results, perioperative and postoperative parameters, and short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS After PSM, there were 18 and 36 patients in the LCL and OCL groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics were comparable after matching. LCL was associated with less blood (100 vs. 300 ml, respectively; P \u003C 0.001) and a shorter postoperative stay (6.0 vs 8.0 days, respectively; P = 0.003). Most patients\u0027 resection margins were \u003E 10 mm in the LCL group (P = 0.021), and all patients with malignancy in both groups achieved R0 resection. In terms of early postoperative outcomes, the overall morbidity rate was identical in each group (11.1% vs. 11.1%, respectively; P = 1.000). No mortality occurred in either group.

Weight, height, and weight discrimination were assessed in the February survey. Psychological, behavioral, and interpersonal responses to the coronavirus were assessed in the March survey. RESULTS Pre-pandemic experiences with weight discrimination were associated with greater concerns about the virus, engaging in more preventative behaviors, less trust in people and institutions to manage the outbreak, and greater perceived declines in connection to one\u0027s community.

However, whether copy number variants (CNVs) in PCP genes contribute to NTDs is unknown. Considering that CNVs are implicated in several human developmental disorders, we hypothesized that CNVs in PCP genes may be causative factors to human NTDs. DNA from umbilical cord tissues of NTD-affected fetuses and parental venous blood samples were collected. We performed a quantitative analysis of copy numbers of all exon regions in the VANGL1, VANGL2, CELSR1, SCRIB, DVL2, DVL3, and PTK7 genes using a CNVplex assay. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out to confirm the results of CNV analysis. As a result, 16 CNVs were identified among the NTDs. Of these CNVs, 5 loci were identified in 11 NTD probands with CNVs involving DVL2 (exons 1-15), VANGL1 (exons 1-7, exon 8), and VANGL2 (exons 5-8, exons 7 and 8). One CNV (DVL2 exons 1-15) was a duplication and the remaining 15 CNVs were deletions. Eleven CNVs were confirmed by qPCR. One de novo CNV in VANGL1 and one DVL2 were detected from two cases. Compared with unaffected control populations in 1000 Genome, ExAC, MARRVEL, DGV, and dbVar databases, the frequencies of de novo deletion in VANGL1 (1.14%) and de novo duplication in DVL2 (0.57%) were significantly higher in our NTD subjects (p \u003C 0.05). This study demonstrates that de novo CNVs in PCP genes, notably deletions in VANGL1 and gains in DVL2, could contribute to the risk of NTDs.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Tian; Lei, Yunping; Chen, Yongyan; Guo, Yinnan; Jin, Lei; Finnell, Richard H; Wang, Linlin; Ren, Aiguo","journal":"Neurogenetics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10048-020-00613-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388773/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novo CNVs","DVL2 exons","VANGL1","PCP genes","risk of NTDs","human NTDs","PTK7 genes","novo duplication","novo deletion","NTD probands","NTD subjects","VANGL2","deletions","results of CNV analysis","qPCR","quantitative analysis of copy numbers","umbilical cord tissues of NTD","increased risk","exon regions","number variants","single-nucleotide variants","human developmental disorders","Quantitative real-time PCR","fetuses","planar cell polarity","Genome","causative factors","ExAC","MARRVEL","DGV","neural tube defects","frequencies","DVL3","CELSR1","SCRIB","parental venous blood samples","dbVar databases","DNA","unaffected control populations","CNVplex assay","loci","gains","study","cases"],"language":"en"},

As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.

The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January 7, 2019 and April 24, 2020. The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians\u0027 attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3,943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72070 files (including 30127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8 % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23 % in the following month and even more by 33 % in the third period. The physicians\u0027 number who attended MTM also decreased by 25 %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grosclaude, Pascale; Azria, David; Guimbaud, Rosine; Thibault, S\u00E9verine; Daubisse, Laetitia; Cartron, Guillaume; Renaudie, Marie-Jos\u00E9; Dalbies, Pierre-Adrien; Delord, Jean-Pierre; Bauvin, Eric","journal":"Bulletin du cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bulcan.2020.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTM"],"locations":["Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["number of meetings","average MTM activity","study of tumor board activity","physicians\u0027 number","average number of files","tumor boards","tumor board sheets","pre-containment activity","average number of physicians\u0027 attendance","real impact","negative impact","TB","containment periods","submissions","moderate decrease","multidisciplinary team meetings","organizational recommendations","equivalent periods","large region","SARS-CoV2 epidemic","presentations","potential delay","oncologic electronic file","quantitative works","evaluation criteria","patient management","carcinologic outcomes","participation","pandemic","addition","following month","quorum"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of dry-bulb temperature, when vapor pressure was matched, on the thermoregulatory, perceptual and performance responses to a 30-min cycling work trial. METHODS Fourteen trained male cyclists (age: 32 \u00B1 12 year; height: 178 \u00B1 6 cm; mass: 76 \u00B1 9 kg; [Formula: see text]: 59 \u00B1 9 mL kg-1 min-1; body surface area: 1.93 \u00B1 0.12 m2; peak power output: 393 \u00B1 53 W) volunteered, and underwent 1 exercise bout in moderate heat (MOD: 34.9 \u00B1 0.2 \u00B0C, 50.1 \u00B1 1.1% relative humidity) and 1 in mild heat (MILD: 29.2 \u00B1 0.2 \u00B0C, 69.4 \u00B1 0.9% relative humidity) matched for vapor pressure (2.8 \u00B1 0.1 kPa), with trials counterbalanced. RESULTS Despite a higher weighted mean skin temperature during MOD (36.3 \u00B1 0.5 vs. 34.5 \u00B1 0.6 \u00B0C, p \u003C 0.01), none of rectal temperature (38.0 \u00B1 0.3 vs. 37.9 \u00B1 0.4 \u00B0C, p = 0.30), local sweat rate (1.0 \u00B1 0.3 vs. 0.9 \u00B1 0.4 mg cm-2 min-1, p = 0.28), cutaneous blood flow (283 \u00B1 116 vs. 287 \u00B1 105 PU, p = 0.90), mean power output (206 \u00B1 37 vs. 205 \u00B1 41 W, p = 0.87) or total work completed (371 \u00B1 64 vs. 369 \u00B1 70 kJ, p = 0.77) showed any difference between environments during the work trial. However, all perceptual measures (perceived exertion, thermal discomfort, thermal sensation, skin wettedness, pleasantness, all p \u003C 0.05) were affected detrimentally during MOD compared to MILD. CONCLUSION In a warm and compensable environment, dry-bulb temperature did not influence high-intensity cycling performance when vapor pressure was maintained, whilst the perceptual responses were affected.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Tze-Huan; Schlader, Zachary J; Che Muhamed, Ahmad Munir; Zheng, Huixin; Stannard, Stephen R; Kondo, Narihiko; Cotter, James D; M\u00FCndel, Toby","journal":"European journal of applied physiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-020-04322-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32072226/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dry-bulb temperature","manipulated temperature","rectal temperature","vapor pressure","relative humidity","ambient humidity","humidity constant","performance responses","mild heat","perceptual responses","work trial","higher weighted mean skin temperature","contribution of dry","aerobic performance","warm environments","mean power output","perceptual measures","total work","PURPOSE Recent studies","peak power output","thermal discomfort","thermal sensation","skin wettedness","moderate heat","perceived exertion","important role","compensable environment","age","m2","pleasantness","high-intensity","METHODS","trained male cyclists","RESULTS","exercise bout","difference","CONCLUSION","kPa","body surface area","local sweat rate","cutaneous blood flow","year","study","Formula","text","height","trials","kJ","mass"],"language":"en"},

The crystallographic structure of Mpro in an apo form was retrieved from Protein Data Bank and marine compounds from PubChem. These structures were prepared for docking and the complex with good docking score was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100ns. To measure the stability, flexibility, and average distance between the target and compounds, root means square deviations (RMSD), root means square fluctuation (RMSF), and the distance matrix were calculated. Among five marine compounds, C-1 (PubChem CID 11170714) exhibited good activity, interacting with the active site and surrounding residues, forming many hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The C-1 also attained a stable dynamic behavior, and the average distance between compound and target remains constant.

The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information. Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. Using an event study framework for all US states, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away. However, the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures. Specifically, searches for \u0022coronavirus\u0022 increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse.

To reduce the spread of the infections and the pressure on Italian healthcare systems, since March 10, 2020, Italy has been under a total lockdown, forcing people into home confinement. Here we present data from 1,310 people living in the Italian territory (Mage = 23.91 \u00B1 3.60 years, 880 females, 501 workers, 809 university students), who completed an online survey from March 24 to March 28, 2020. In the survey, we asked participants to think about their use of digital media before going to bed, their sleep pattern and their subjective experience of time in the previous week (March 17-23, which was the second week of the lockdown) and up to the first week of February (February 3-10, before any restriction in any Italian area). During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, and associated with the feeling of elongation of time. Considering that the lockdown is likely to continue for weeks, research data are urgently needed to support decision making, to build public awareness and to provide timely and supportive psychosocial interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cellini, Nicola; Canale, Natale; Mioni, Giovanna; Costa, Sebastiano","journal":"Journal of sleep research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410272/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["people","sleep pattern","sleep difficulties","sleep timing","sleep habits","total lockdown","lower sleep quality","home confinement","Italian territory","Italian area","Italy","previous week","usage of digital media","subjective experience of time","use of digital media","Italian healthcare systems","research data","present data","online survey","higher level of depression","anxiety","pressure","public awareness","workers","stress symptomatology","infections","bedtime","weeks","change","decision making","supportive psychosocial interventions","university students","females","years","major COVID","Mage","increase","feeling of elongation","hotspots","spread","participants","restriction"],"language":"en"},

Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health. The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms\u00AE software was used. RESULTS One hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey. Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 \u003C 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 \u2265 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs. 79.2%, p=.025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs. 19.8%, p=.024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs. 23.8%, p=.049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 \u00B1 27.30 vs. 9.52 \u00B1 11.75, p=.041). Moreover, PHQ-9 \u2265 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 \u00B1 4.96 vs. 4.88 \u00B1 3.53 and 11.60 \u00B1 5.53 vs. 4.84 \u00B1 3.81, respectively; p\u003C.001), and a worse quality of life in both mental (34.60 \u00B1 7.45 vs. 46.01 \u00B1 7.83, p\u003C.001) and physical (43.50 \u00B1 9.37 vs. 52.94 \u00B1 4.78, p\u003C.001) component summary. CONCLUSIONS Our results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions.

C. Giulianotti in 2001 (Arch Surg 138(7):777-784, 2003). Since then, the complexity and lack of technique standardization has slowed down its widespread utilization. RPD has been increasingly adopted worldwide and in few centres is the preferred apporached approach by certain surgeons. Some large retrospective series are available and data seem to indicate that RPD is safe/feasible, and a valid alternative to the classic open Whipple. Our group has recently described a standardized 17 steps approach to RPD (Giulianotti et al. Surg Endosc 32(10): 4329-4336, 2018). Herin, we present an educational step-by-step surgical video with short technical/operative description to visually exemplify the RPD 17 steps technique. METHODS The current project has been approved by our local Institutional Review Board (IRB). We edited a step-by-step video guidance of our RPD standardized technique. The data/video images were collected from a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database (IRB approved). The narration and the images describe hands-on operative \u0022tips and tricks\u0022 to facilitate the learning/teaching/evaluation process. RESULTS Each of the 17 surgical steps is visually represented and explained to help the in-depth understanding of the relevant surgical anatomy and the specific operative technique. CONCLUSIONS Educational videos descriptions like the one herein presented are a valid learning/teaching tool to implement standardized surgical approaches. Standardization is a crucial component of the learning curve. This approach can create more objective and reproducible data which might be more reliably assessed/compared across institutions and by different surgeons. Promising results are arising from several centers about RPD. However, RPD as gold standard-approach is still a matter of debate. Randomized-controlled studies (RCT) are required to better validate the precise role of RPD.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo; Mangano, Alberto; Bustos, Roberto E; Fernandes, Eduardo; Masrur, Mario A; Valle, Valentina; Gangemi, Antonio; Bianco, Francesco M","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07383-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31953732/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P.

The present study aimed to measure the length of the extensor mechanism and to assess the effect of limb position on the quadriceps muscle length (QML)/femoral bone length (FL) ratio. STUDY DESIGN Three-dimensional computed tomography images were taken of 12 Beagle dogs. Each dog underwent computed tomographic imaging 24 times with different limb positions. The QML/FL was measured on each image, along with the hip flexion-extension, hip abduction-adduction and stifle flexion-extension angles. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effect of these angles on the QML/FL. RESULTS The QML/FL was increased with the hip extended (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.855 with linear plotting, 0.829 with log plotting) and with the stifle flexed (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.814 with linear plotting, 0.800 with log plotting). The partial regression coefficient of the hip abduction-adduction angle was small, indicating a small impact on the QML/FL. The 95% confidence range of the QML/FL with the hip extended and stifle flexed was 0.87 to 1.00 (mean \u00B1 standard deviation: 0.93 \u00B1 0.03). CONCLUSION The QML/FL was more influenced by joint angles when the hip was flexed or the stifle was extended. Hence, these positions should be avoided when evaluating the QML/FL so that the QML is less altered by slight positioning disparities.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murakami, Sawako; Nagahiro, Yukari; Shimada, Masakazu; Kanno, Nobuo; Suzuki, Shuji; Yogo, Takuya; Harada, Yasuji; Hara, Yasushi","journal":"Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1702235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408359/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QML/FL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["QML","hip flexion-extension","linear plotting","standardized partial regression coefficient","log plotting","hip abduction-adduction angle","stifle flexion-extension angles","Multiple regression analysis","joint angles","normal dogs","OBJECTIVES Dogs","Beagle dogs","femoral bone length","quadriceps muscle length","effect of limb position","shorter extensor mechanism","different limb positions","small impact","present study","computed tomographic imaging","STUDY DESIGN Three-dimensional computed tomography images","times","patella alta","ratio","slight positioning disparities","RESULTS","confidence range","mean","standard deviation","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, it is difficult to guarantee accuracy and avoid obstacles in puncture process. Therefore, developing a viable path planning method is particularly important. In this research, the bending deformation law of flexible needles during puncture was studied and the puncture path was planned to provide a feasible method for clinical application of flexible needles. METHODS According to the researchs that have been conducted, the path of the flexible needle in the tissue could be considered as a circular arc stitching. This research studied the calculation method of arc radius and obtained its actual value by the puncture experiments. Based on the arc model, the spatial transformation method of three-dimensional path planning was studied. In addition, a simplified particle swarm optimization (PSO) was applied into the process of path planning by changing the central angle of arc and the rotation angle of the needle body. RESULTS The results of Experiment 1 showed that the path radius of the flexible needle pierced into gelatin prosthesis was influenced by four parameters, which were needle diameter, tip angle, puncture speed and the weight ratio of gelatin powder. As the needle diameter and tip angle increased, the radius of needle path tended to increase, but when the puncture speed and gelatin mass ratio increased, the radius of needle path decreased. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the distances of needle tip apart from target point were 3.2 mm (barrier-free experiments) and 1.8 mm (obstacle experiments). CONCLUSIONS This research links the intelligent algorithm with the flexible needle puncture tissue process, which has high value in future clinical application. By setting the correct boundary conditions and parameters, the flexible needle can be planned to reach the target point accurately.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Chenxu; Sun, Chunsheng; Han, Ying; Zhang, Qinhe","journal":"Computer methods and programs in biomedicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flexible path","puncture path","radius of needle path","needle diameter","path radius","flexible needle puncture tissue process","needle body","puncture process","puncture experiments","puncture speed","distances of needle tip","process of path planning","viable path planning method","clinical application of flexible needles","tip angle","OBJECTIVE Percutaneous puncture","calculation method of arc radius","spatial transformation method of three-dimensional path planning","central angle of arc","bending deformation law of flexible needles","important value","rotation angle","feasible method","arc model","results of Experiment","future clinical application","high value","actual value","gelatin mass ratio","parameters","gelatin prosthesis","research links","circular arc stitching","obstacle experiments","target point","weight ratio of gelatin powder","barrier-free experiments","intelligent algorithm","low trauma","simplified particle swarm optimization","PSO","addition","CONCLUSIONS","correct boundary conditions","accuracy","obstacles","BACKGROUND","METHODS","researchs"],"language":"en"},

Studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 in saliva with a viral load that lasts for a long period. However, researchers are yet to establish whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly enter the salivary glands. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the presence of ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in salivary glands using publicly available databases. METHODS The distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSSs family in salivary gland tissue and other tissues was analyzed. The GTEx dataset was employed to explore the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in various body organs and salivary glands in a healthy population. The single-cell sequencing data for salivary gland samples (including submandibular salivary gland and parotid gland) from mice were collected and analyzed. The components and proportions of salivary gland cells expressing the key protease TMPRSSs family were analyzed. RESULTS Transcriptome data analysis showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in salivary glands. The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were marginal without significant differences in different age groups or between men and women. Single-cell RNA sequence analysis indicated that TMPRSS2 was mainly expressed in salivary gland epithelial cells. CONCLUSION We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be entered in salivary glands.

In general, most species have developed mechanisms to minimize inbreeding such as dispersal and kin avoidance behavior. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, related individuals typically share a common nest and have relatively short mating periods, this could lead to inbreeding, and because of their single-locus complementary sex determination system, it may generate diploid males that could result in infertile triploid progeny representing a cost for the colony. Vespula germanica, is an eusocial wasp that has invaded many parts of the world, despite likely facing a reduced genetic pool during the arrival phases. We ask whether male wasp display specific aggregation behavior that favors genetic diversity, key to reduce inbreeding. Through a set of laboratory experiments, we investigated the effects of drone nestmateship and density on the aggregation behavior of V. germanica drones. We show that drones avoid aggregating with their nestmates at all densities while non-nestmates are avoided only at high densities. This suggests that lek genetic diversity and density could be regulated through drone behavior and in the long run minimize inbreeding favoring invasion success.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masciocchi, Mait\u00E9; Angeletti, B\u00E1rbara; Corley, Juan C; Mart\u00EDnez, Andr\u00E9s S","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64232-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Vespula"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Inbreeding","aggregation behavior of","drone behavior","specific aggregation behavior","density","reduced genetic pool","kin avoidance behavior","lek genetic diversity","eusocial wasp","germanica drones","reduced fitness","non-nestmates","male wasp","eusocial Hymenoptera","Vespula germanica","high densities","effects of drone nestmateship","infertile triploid progeny","long run","single-locus complementary sex determination system","common nest","population viability","related individuals","dispersal","negative consequences","diploid males","short mating periods","cost","mechanisms","invasion success","arrival phases","key","parts","species","set of laboratory experiments","colony","world"],"language":"en"},

A prospective double-blinded randomized control trial.","doi":"10.1007/s10029-020-02136-3","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32072340","license":"unk","abstract":"INTRODUCTION Seroma is a commonly encountered sequela after hernia repair. Tremendous effort has been spent to investigate the effective way to prevent this \u0022complication\u0022 including the modification of surgical technique, use of per-peritoneal drainage, etc. There were debates about the use of monopolar diathermy versus blunt dissection in laparoscopic TEP in the prevention of seroma formation. This randomized study aims to compare the effects of using 2 techniques in laparoscopic TEP on pre-peritoneal drain output and seroma formation. METHOD From 1.9.2018 to 30.9.2019, all male and female patients presented with the first occurrence, unilateral inguinal hernia anticipated for laparoscopic TEP were enrolled into the study after informed consent. Patients were randomized into \u0022monopolar dissection preferred\u0022 (MDP) group and \u0022blunt dissection-preferred\u0022 (BDP) group just before commencing of operation after general anesthesia. Surgeons were instructed to use monopolar energy as main dissection method for the whole operation if possible (MDP), whereas blunt dissection is the preferred choice in BDP group, but the use of monopolar energy was allowed if needed. Total energy time was measured by a specially designed homemade device attaching to the monopolar pedals as accurate as to millisecond (ms). Pre-peritoneal drains were inserted for drainage and removed 23 h after operation. Drainage output, total operating time, energy time, clinical and ultrasonic seroma sizes at day 1, day 6, 1-month post operations, recurrence are compared between 2 groups. RESULTS A total of 103 patients where included. There was no significant difference in age, gender, co-morbidities, side of hernia, mean defect size, operating time, fixation adjuncts, or postoperative stay. The drain volume in BDP group is 71.13 \u00B1 31.42 mL while it in MDP group is 56.36 \u00B1 21.46 mL. The MDP group had significantly fewer drain output at 23 h post operation (p = 0.007) and lower seroma incidence on days 6 (p = 0.036). Overall incidence of seroma formation was 12% on postoperative day 1, 11% on postoperative day 7. No statistically differences in postoperative pain score or complications were observed at the first week, 1- and 3-months\u0027 post operation. There was no correlation with energy time to the drain output. No recurrence was found in subsequent follow-up. CONCLUSION Pre-peritoneal drainage is clinically safe in laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal hernioplasty and can effectively reduce the size and incidence of seroma. The seroma formation can be further reduced by appropriate use of monopolar energy as preferred dissection approach in lap TEP. Due to limitation in measuring the actual energy time, the result should be further validated by randomized multi-centers trial on its potential benefit in hernia repair by a more accurate measuring device on energy used.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, J W; Chen, K J; Xu, X H; Deng, Y; Zhang, H; Chan, F S Y; Kim, H J; Fan, J K M","journal":"Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02136-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32072340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monopolar dissection","Total energy time","actual energy time","appropriate use of monopolar energy","MDP group","blunt dissection","INTRODUCTION Seroma","BDP group","prevention of seroma formation","laparoscopic TEP","pre-peritoneal drain output","Drainage output","postoperative day","use of monopolar diathermy","lower seroma incidence","Overall incidence of seroma formation","total operating time","preferred dissection approach","monopolar pedals","ultrasonic seroma sizes","CONCLUSION Pre-peritoneal drainage","fewer drain output","hernia repair","main dissection method","Pre-peritoneal drains","months\u0027 post operation","lap TEP","drain volume","postoperative stay","preferred choice","randomized study","extra-peritoneal hernioplasty","unilateral inguinal hernia","accurate measuring device","postoperative pain score","recurrence","female patients","month post operations","mean defect size","designed homemade device","fixation adjuncts","potential benefit","gender","co-morbidities","occurrence","encountered sequela","techniques","multi-centers trial","complications","millisecond","effects","days","significant difference","modification of surgical technique","limitation","result","correlation","effective way","subsequent follow-up","ms","general anesthesia","Surgeons","Tremendous effort","week","groups","consent"],"language":"en"},

Their binding alters the activity, stability, localization, and phosphorylation state of a target protein. The association of 14-3-3 proteins with the regulation of a wide range of general and specific signaling pathways suggests their crucial role in health and disease. Recent studies have linked 14-3-3 to several RNA and DNA viruses that may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of infections. Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of host-virus interactions is vital for understanding the viral life cycle and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Moreover, pharmaceutical research is already moving towards targeting host proteins in the control of virus pathogenesis. As such, targeting the right host protein to interrupt host-virus interactions could be an effective therapeutic strategy. In this review, we generated a 14-3-3 protein interactions roadmap in viruses, using the freely available Virusmentha network, an online virus-virus or virus-host interaction tool. Furthermore, we summarize the role of the 14-3-3 family in RNA and DNA viruses.

We hereby review the clinical insights with regard to using molecular tests and immunoassays in the context of COVID-19 management life cycle: the preventive phase, the preparedness phase, the response phase and the recovery phase. The spatial and temporal distribution of viral RNA, antigens and antibodies during human infection is summarized to provide a biological foundation for accurate detection of the disease. We shared the lessons learned and the obstacles encountered during real world high-volume screening programs. Clinical needs are discussed to identify existing technology gaps in these tests.

Both the pandemic and the measures taken to combat it can affect individuals\u0027 mental health. AIMS The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety and health anxiety in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the factors affecting these. METHOD The study was performed using an online questionnaire. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus\u002B patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated. RESULTS In terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6% (n = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1% (n = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety. In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety. CONCLUSION The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease. Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6zdin, Sel\u00E7uk; Bayrak \u00D6zdin, \u015E\u00FCkriye","journal":"The International journal of social psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020927051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Anxiety Inventory","HADS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Health Anxiety Inventory","health anxiety levels of factors","Hospital Anxiety","pandemic","previous psychiatric history","previous psychiatric illness history","risk factors","levels of depression","depression cut-off point","current psychiatric illness","urban areas","Depression Scale","societies\u0027 mental health","individuals\u0027 mental health","COVID","accompanying chronic disease","future psychiatric planning","female gender","presence","RESULTS","cross-sectional study","terms of HADS cut-off points","negative effects","relatives","friends","patient","age","women","Turkish society","sociodemographic data form","new Coronavirus","marital status","sex","population","regression analysis","CONCLUSION","groups","HAI","online questionnaire","BACKGROUND","Participants","purpose","METHOD","measures","Priority"],"language":"en"},

Informal caregivers can experience burden as a result of their role, with possible implications for quality of life (QOL). We review recent research examining MS caregiver experience to (1) understand current risk factors for caregiver burden and (2) identify possible strategies for increasing carer well-being. RECENT FINDINGS MS caregiver experience is highly variable and can be predicted by a variety of care recipient, caregiver and contextual factors. Burden is not the only characteristic associated with care, with positive consequences also reported. Emerging research suggests a number of ways in which carers can be better supported. Identifying and meeting the needs of MS caregivers offers the best way of delivering tailored support.

Here, we present the rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The trial uses a novel design entitled a randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform (REMAP). The design has 5 key features: i.) randomization, allowing robust causal inference; ii.) embedding of study procedures into routine care processes, facilitating enrollment, trial efficiency, and generalizability; iii.) a multifactorial statistical model comparing multiple interventions across multiple patient subgroups; iv.) response-adaptive randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most favorable, and v.) a platform structured to permit continuous, potentially perpetual enrollment beyond the evaluation of the initial treatments. The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within 4 treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240 treatment regimens. The trial generates estimates of superiority, inferiority and equivalence between regimens on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, stratified by presence or absence of concomitant shock and proven or suspected influenza infection. The trial will also compare ventilatory and oxygenation strategies and has capacity to address additional questions rapidly during pandemic respiratory infections. As of January 2020, REMAP-CAP was approved and enrolling patients in 52 ICUs in 13 countries in 3 continents. In February, it transitioned into pandemic mode with several design adaptations for COVID-19 disease. Lessons learned from the design and conduct of this trial should aid in dissemination of similar platform initiatives in other disease areas.

Ibuprofen on an \u0022around-the-clock\u0022 basis has been suggested to control postoperative pain sufficiently. Therefore, we established a standard scheme with weight-adapted recommended maximum ibuprofen dose. A reliable assessment of pain intensity can be performed with the Children\u0027s and Infants\u0027 Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) in children \u003C 5 years, or with the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) in children aged \u2265 5 years. The Parents\u0027 Postoperative Pain Measure (PPPM-D) may be a useful tool for both age groups. We hypothesized that not more than 30% of the children would need an opioid rescue medication during their in-hospital stay and analyzed the consistency of the PPPM-D with other pain scales. METHODS We included 158 in-patients aged 2-12 years. Ibuprofen was orally administered every 8 h. Three times daily, pain scores were assessed by CHIPPS or FPS-R, respectively. The PPPM-D was used in all children. Exceeding the cut-off value in one of the tools was regarded as relevant pain. RESULTS A rescue medication was needed in 82.1% of children after tonsillectomy and 51.3% of children after tonsillotomy (P \u003C 0.001). The cut-off value for relevant pain was mostly exceeded in the PPPM-D, but its overall concordance to the reference scales was low. CONCLUSION High-dose ibuprofen \u0022around-the-clock\u0022 is insufficient to control pain in children after tonsil surgery. Research is needed to find an optimal schema for management and assessment of postoperative pain.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gude, Philipp; Gustedt, Franziska; Bellgardt, Martin; Vogelsang, Heike; Herzog-Niescery, Jennifer; Dazert, Stefan; Weber, Thomas Peter; Volkenstein, Stefan","journal":"European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-05929-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pain scales","relevant pain","pain scores","assessment of postoperative pain","Faces Pain Scale","Infants\u0027 Postoperative Pain Scale","Parents\u0027 Postoperative Pain Measure","optimal pain management concept","reliable assessment of pain intensity","PPPM-D","years","CHIPPS","tonsil surgery","recommended maximum ibuprofen dose","CONCLUSION High-dose ibuprofen","FPS-R","cut-off value","opioid rescue medication","optimal schema","reference scales","weight","overall concordance","Children\u0027s","useful tool","PURPOSE","tools","standard scheme","age groups","hospital","consistency","basis","in-patients","tonsillotomy","times","tonsillectomy","METHODS","Research"],"language":"en"},

The most clinically relevant NTDs in Italy are leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis, followed by strongyloidiasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. Cystic echinococcosis, that was not included in the analysis since a similar study on this disease was recently published, should also be listed among the leading NTD in Italy. While schistosomiasis has its highest burden on population coming from highly endemic areas such as SSA, leishmaniasis is especially relevant in Italian-born residents of southern regions. Education at university and post-graduate levels, to increase the awareness of healthcare professionals on these topics, as well as targeted public health interventions (such as screening or presumptive treatment in high-risk groups), are an asset to improve clinical management and control of these diseases.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tilli, Marta; Botta, Annarita; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Corti, Giampaolo; Zammarchi, Lorenzo","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-020-01443-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSA"],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa","Bolivia"],"keyphrases":["Italy","leishmaniasis","schistosomiasis","relevant NTDs","Chagas disease","strongyloidiasis","CONCLUSIONS NTDs","dengue","number of residents","rate of hospitalization","SSA","negligible burden","highest burden","Italians","burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases","Average yearly hospitalization rate","residents of southern regions","Hospitalization rates higher","foreign citizens","general population","citizenship group","age group","common diagnoses","screening","sex","cysticercosis","Taenia solium taeniasis","filariasis","Hospital Discharge Records","topics","asset","high-risk groups","Sub-Saharan Africa","epidemiology","post-graduate levels","targeted public health interventions","presumptive treatment","endemic areas","Education","university","subjects","clinical management","control","awareness of healthcare professionals","female ratio","METHODS","Bolivia","similar study","hospitalizations","accounting","analysis","period","PURPOSE","leading NTD","RESULTS","Cystic echinococcosis","foreigners","years"],"language":"en"},

Our aim of this article is to review the current role of the ablative therapy in the management of CRLM patients. Main indications for thermal ablation include (I) unresectable liver lesions; (II) in combination with hepatectomy; (III) in patients with significant medical comorbidities or poor performance status (PS); (IV) a small (\u003C3 cm) solitary lesion, which would otherwise necessitate a major liver resection; and (V) patient preference. There are several approaches and modalities for ablative therapy, including open, percutaneous, and laparoscopic approaches, as well as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Each approach and ablation modality have its own pros and cons. Percutaneous and laparoscopic approaches are preferred due to minimally invasive nature, yet laparoscopic approach has more benefits from thorough intraoperative ultrasound (US) exam as well as complete peritoneal staging with laparoscopy. Similarly, whereas high local tumor failure rate has been a major concern with RFA, MWA or microwave thermosphere ablation (MTA) have demonstrated significantly improved local tumor control due to homogenous tissue heating, ability to reach higher tissue temperatures, and less susceptible to the \u0022heat-sink\u0022 effect. Although liver resection is the standard of care for CRLM, there have been some retrospective studies demonstrating similar oncological outcome between ablative therapy and surgical resection in very selected populations with small (\u003C3 cm) solitary CRLM. Lastly, ablative therapy and liver resection should not be mutually exclusive, especially in the management of bilobar liver metastases. Concomitant ablative therapy with hepatectomy may spare the patients from having two-stage hepatectomy with less morbidity. The role of the thermal ablation will continue to evolve in patients with resectable and ablatable lesions owing to newly emerging technology, in addition to new systemic treatment options, including immunotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takahashi, Hideo; Berber, Eren","journal":"Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/hbsn.2019.06.08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32140478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRLM","RFA","MTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thermal ablation","thermal ablative therapy","microwave ablation","Concomitant ablative therapy","radiofrequency ablation","major liver resection","ablation modality","management of CRLM patients","microwave thermosphere ablation","unresectable liver lesions","laparoscopic approaches","solitary CRLM","unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases","management of bilobar liver metastases","surgical resection","RFA","MWA","stage hepatectomy","high local tumor failure rate","metastatic colorectal cancer","major concern","ablatable lesions","patient population","current role","patient preference","solitary lesion","homogenous tissue heating","higher tissue temperatures","improved overall survival","important treatment option","new systemic treatment options","immunotherapy","exam","similar oncological outcome","poor performance status","significant medical comorbidities","addition","thorough intraoperative ultrasound","ability","benefits","emerging technology","recent randomized prospective trial","retrospective studies","MTA","complete peritoneal staging","selected populations","PS","CRC","standard of care","modalities","invasive nature","heat-sink","laparoscopy","article","Main indications","effect","morbidity","combination","aim"],"language":"en"},

To minimize the risk of this complication, capsulectomy is performed using monopolar cautery or ultrasonic surgical instrumentation, the latter of which can be conducted with a Harmonic scalpel. To date, there is disagreement regarding which of the two methods is superior. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcomes between a group of patients who underwent surgery using a Harmonic scalpel and another group treated with monopolar cautery. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who underwent capsulectomy as part of two-stage breast reconstruction between January 2018 and February 2019 and who received at least 1 month of follow-up after surgery. Operative time and postoperative outcomes, including drainage duration, were analyzed. Results In total, 36 female patients underwent capsulectomy. The monopolar group consisted of 18 patients and 22 breasts, while the Harmonic scalpel group consisted of 18 patients and 21 breasts. There was no statistically significant difference in demographics between the two groups. The Harmonic scalpel group had a significantly shorter mean drainage duration (6.65 days vs. 7.36 days) and a smaller mean total drainage volume (334.69 mL vs. 433.54 mL) than the monopolar cautery group (P\u003C0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed with regard to seroma or hematoma formation. Conclusions The Harmonic scalpel approach for capsulectomy reduced the total drainage volume and drainage duration compared to the monopolar cautery approach. Therefore, this approach could serve as a good alternative to electrocautery.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ki Jae; Chung, Jae Ho; Lee, Hyung Chul; Lee, Byung Il; Park, Seung Ha; Yoon, Eul Sik","journal":"Archives of plastic surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5999/aps.2019.01130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32098006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Harmonic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group of patients","monopolar group","Harmonic scalpel group","monopolar cautery group","Harmonic scalpel approach","capsulectomy","monopolar cautery approach","female patients","shorter mean drainage duration","smaller mean total drainage volume","days","postoperative outcomes","stage breast reconstruction","surgery","methods","significant difference","breasts","implant breast reconstruction","common complication","stage expander","regard","seroma","Background Capsular contracture","retrospective chart review","ultrasonic surgical instrumentation","Conclusions","Operative time","hematoma formation","good alternative","demographics","study","Results","electrocautery","disagreement","groups","month of follow-up","risk","date","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Breast density is a well-known risk factor and has the potential to improve accuracy of risk prediction models. In this study we reviewed the impact on model performance of adding breast density to clinical breast cancer risk prediction models. METHODS We conducted a systematic review using a pre-specified search strategy for PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 2007 until November 2019. Studies were screened using the Covidence software. Eligible studies developed or modified existing breast cancer risk prediction models applicable to the general population of women by adding breast density to the model. Improvement in discriminatory accuracy was measured as an increase in the Area Under the Curve or concordance statistics. RESULTS Eleven eligible studies were identified by the search and one by reference check. Four studies modified the Gail model, four modified the Tyrer-Cuzick model, and five studies developed new models. Several methods were used to measure breast density, including visual, semi- and fully automated methods. Eleven studies reported discriminatory accuracy and one study reported calibration. Seven studies found a statistically significantly increased discriminatory accuracy when including density in the model. The increase in AUC ranged 0.03 to 0.14. Four studies did not report on statistical significance, but reported an increased AUC ranging from 0.01 to 0.06.

We assessed the applicability of ECoG to monitor different stages of sedation, as well as the influence of different patient characteristics, such as tumour volume, size, entity, and age or gender on permutation entropy (PeEn). We conducted retrospective analysis of the ECoG data of 16 patients, who underwent awake craniotomies because of left-sided brain tumours at our centre between 2014 and 2016.

A comparison of PeEn scores showed significantly higher values in awake patients than in patients under anaesthesia (p \u2264 0.004) and significantly higher ones in the state of transition than under general anaesthesia (p = 0.023). PeEn scores in frontal and parietal leads did not differ significantly, making them both applicable for continuous surveillance during brain surgery. None of the following clinical characteristics showed significant correlation with PeEn scores: tumour volume, WHO grade, first or recurrent tumour, gender, and sex. Being 50 years or older led to significantly lower values in parietal leads but not in frontal leads.

Emerging predictors for poor outcome include advanced age, male gender, pre-existing cardiovascular disease and risk factors including hypertension, diabetes and more recently obesity. Herein, we posit new obesity-driven predictors of poor COVID-19 outcome, over and above the more obvious extant risks associated with obesity including cardiometabolic disease and hypoventilation syndrome in intensive care patients. We outline a theoretical mechanistic framework whereby adipose tissue in subjects with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation and cytokine amplification. We propose studies to test this reservoir concept with a focus on specific cytokine pathways that might be amplified in subjects with obesity and COVID-19. Finally, we underscore emerging therapeutic strategies that might benefit subsets of patients in which cytokine amplification is excessive and potentially fatal.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Caplice, Noel M","journal":"Obesity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytokine amplification","new obesity-driven predictors of poor COVID","cardiometabolic disease","poor outcome","Coronavirus disease","Emerging predictors","subjects","pre-existing cardiovascular disease","specific cytokine pathways","subsets of patients","reservoir concept","intensive care patients","emerging therapeutic strategies","male gender","advanced age","increased shedding","hypoventilation syndrome","risk factors","immune activation","extensive viral spread","adipose tissue","hypertension","focus","theoretical mechanistic framework","diabetes","obvious extant risks","century","worst pandemic","lives","studies","date"],"language":"en"},

Although there is an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease may not be infected with COVID-19. The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating a ST-elevation MI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on 1) the varied clinical presentations; 2) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; 3) role of the Emergency Department, Emergency Medical System and the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely fashion, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis-based strategy may be entertained at non-PCI capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.

This study examined whether self-monitoring can reduce clinic BP in patients with hypertension-related co-morbidity. METHODS A systematic review was conducted of articles published in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library up to January 2018. Randomised controlled trials of self-monitoring of BP were selected and individual patient data (IPD) were requested. Contributing studies were prospectively categorised by whether they examined a low/high intensity co-intervention. Change in BP and likelihood of uncontrolled BP at 12-months were examined according to number and type of hypertension-related co-morbidity in a one-stage IPD meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 22 trials were eligible, 16 of which were able to provide IPD for the primary outcome, including 6,522 (89%) participants with follow-up data. Self-monitoring was associated with reduced clinic systolic BP compared to usual care at 12-month follow-up, regardless of the number of hypertension-related co-morbidities (-3.12 mmHg, [95%CI -4.78, -1.46 mmHg]; p value for interaction with number of morbidities = 0.260). Intense interventions were more effective than low-intensity interventions in patients with obesity (p\u003C0.001 for all outcomes), and possibly stroke (p\u003C0.004 for BP control outcome only), but this effect was not observed in patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes or chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS Self-monitoring lowers BP regardless of the number of hypertension-related co-morbidities, but may only be effective in conditions such obesity or stroke when combined with high intensity co-interventions.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheppard, J P; Tucker, K L; Davison, W J; Stevens, R; Aekplakorn, W; Bosworth, H B; Bove, A; Earle, K; Godwin, M; Green, B B; Hebert, P; Heneghan, C; Hill, N; Hobbs, F D R; Kantola, I; Kerry, S M; Leiva, A; Magid, D J; Mant, J; Margolis, K L; McKinstry, B; McLaughlin, M A; McNamara, K; Omboni, S; Ogedegbe, O; Parati, G; Varis, J; Verberk, W J; Wakefield, B J; McManus, R J","journal":"American journal of hypertension","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpz182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31730171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Studies","BP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related co-morbidities","clinic BP","hypertension-related co-morbidity","high intensity co-interventions","number of hypertension","CONCLUSIONS Self-monitoring lowers BP","number of morbidities","Randomised controlled trials of self-monitoring of BP","BP control outcome","likelihood of uncontrolled BP","patients","reduced clinic systolic BP","self-monitoring of blood pressure","low-intensity interventions","type of hypertension","Intense interventions","p value","mmHg","obesity","follow-up data","stroke","stage IPD meta-analysis","month follow-up","primary outcome","BACKGROUND Studies","chronic kidney disease","coronary heart disease","individual patient data","diabetes","usual care","interaction","articles","Medline","Embase","systematic review","Cochrane Library","conditions","efficacy","presence","months","METHODS","total","participants","effect","study","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

However, there is no systematic review to comprehensively address patient portal interventions and patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to synthesize evidence with regard to the characteristics and psychobehavioral and clinical outcomes of patient portal interventions. METHODS In November 2018, we conducted searches in 3 electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and a total of 24 articles met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS All but 3 studies were conducted in the United States. The types of study designs varied, and samples predominantly involved non-Hispanic white and highly educated patients with sizes ranging from 50 to 22,703. Most of the portal interventions used tailored alerts or educational resources tailored to the patient\u0027s condition. Patient portal interventions lead to improvements in a wide range of psychobehavioral outcomes, such as health knowledge, self-efficacy, decision making, medication adherence, and preventive service use. Effects of patient portal interventions on clinical outcomes including blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and weight loss were mixed. CONCLUSIONS Patient portal interventions were overall effective in improving a few psychological outcomes, medication adherence, and preventive service use. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of patient portals to improve clinical outcomes. Understanding the role of patient portals as an effective intervention strategy is an essential step to encourage patients to be actively engaged in their health care.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Hae-Ra; Gleason, Kelly T; Sun, Chun-An; Miller, Hailey N; Kang, Soo Jin; Chow, Sotera; Anderson, Rachel; Nagy, Paul; Bauer, Tom","journal":"JMIR human factors","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/15038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31855187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Allied Health Literature"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["patient outcomes","clinical outcomes of patient portal interventions","CONCLUSIONS Patient portal interventions","Effects of patient portal interventions","use of patient portals","secure patient portals","role of patient portals","psychological outcomes","health care","preventive service use","health knowledge","wide range of psychobehavioral outcomes","medication adherence","Allied Health Literature","regard","advent of electronic health record","educated patients","facilitating patients","electronic databases","EHR system","tailored alerts","insufficient evidence","effective intervention strategy","types of study designs","decision making","glucose","Cumulative Index","self-efficacy","educational resources","blood pressure","EMBASE","Nursing","active roles","improvements","cholesterol","samples","PubMed","total","essential step","systems","characteristics","attention","systematic review","studies","articles","weight loss","patient\u0027s condition","sizes","BACKGROUND","eligibility criteria","United States","searches","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

As many countries are grappling with the onset of their epidemics, pharmacotherapeutics remain lacking. The window of opportunity to mitigate downstream morbidity and mortality is narrow but remains open. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial to the homeostasis of both the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 utilises and interrupts this pathway directly, which could be described as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-SARS-CoV-2-axis (RAAS-SCoV-axis). There exists significant controversy and confusion surrounding how anti-hypertensive agents might function along this pathway. This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding the RAAS-SCoV-axis, informed by prior studies of SARS-CoV, how this relates to our currently evolving pandemic, and how these insights might guide our next steps in an evidence-based manner. OBSERVATIONS This review discusses the role of the RAAS-SCoV-axis in acute lung injury and the effects, risks, and benefits of pharmacologic modification of this axis. There may be an opportunity to leverage the different aspects of RAAS inhibitors to mitigate indirect viral-induced lung injury. Concerns have been raised that such modulation might exacerbate the disease. While relevant preclinical, experimental models to date favor a protective effect of RAAS-SCoV-axis inhibition on both lung injury and survival, clinical data related to the role of RAAS modulation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited. CONCLUSION Proposed interventions for SARS-CoV-2 predominantly focus on viral microbiology and aim to inhibit viral cellular injury. While these therapies are promising, immediate use may not be feasible, and the time window of their efficacy remains a major unanswered question. An alternative approach is the modulation of the specific downstream pathophysiologic effects caused by virus that lead to morbidity and mortality. We propose a preponderance of evidence that supports clinical equipoise regarding the efficacy of RAAS-based interventions, and the imminent need for a multisite randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the inhibition of the RAAS-SCoV-axis on acute lung injury in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ingraham, Nicholas E; Barakat, Abdo G; Reilkoff, Ronald; Bezdicek, Tamara; Schacker, Timothy; Chipman, Jeffrey G; Tignanelli, Christopher J; Puskarich, Michael A","journal":"The European respiratory journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00912-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAAS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["RAAS-SCoV","SARS-CoV","efficacy of RAAS","SCoV-axis inhibition","role of RAAS modulation","acute lung injury","aldosterone-SARS","protective effect of RAAS","setting of SARS","different aspects of RAAS inhibitors","viral cellular injury","mortality","indirect viral-induced lung injury","prior studies of SARS","downstream morbidity","significant morbidity","clinical data","clinical equipoise","based interventions","viral microbiology","COVID","renin-angiotensin","IMPORTANCE Coronavirus Disease","window of opportunity","review","pathway","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","evidence-based manner","specific downstream pathophysiologic effects","aldosterone system","significant controversy","respiratory systems","time window","global pandemic","preponderance of evidence","evolving pandemic","multisite randomised controlled clinical trial","CONCLUSION Proposed interventions","date","imminent need","risks","experimental models","confusion","survival","anti-hypertensive agents","benefits of pharmacologic modification","current state of knowledge","steps","homeostasis","major unanswered question","onset","epidemics","pharmacotherapeutics","immediate use","insights","Wuhan","alternative approach","China","therapies","OBSERVATIONS","countries","Concerns"],"language":"en"},

Due to a lack of knowledge about the virus, a significant number of potential targets for using a particular drug have been proposed. Five cases with a clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis (IA) are presented here. The 5 cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non-specific symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnoea, and arthralgias) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region during the first month of the outbreak (1-31 March 2020), using the similar period from 2019 as a comparator. A secondary detailed analysis of all stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions was performed in the center with the largest case volume. RESULTS Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments (40.9% less intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and 27.6% less mechanical thrombectomy (MT)). No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (-0.6%). The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), p=0.034. There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis among stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions. CONCLUSION These results suggest overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.

Amplification of viral RNA by rRT-PCR serves as the gold standard for confirmation of infection, yet it needs a long turnaround time (3-4 h to generate results) and shows false-negative rates as large as 15%-20%. In addition, the need of certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel led many countries to limit the rRT-PCR tests only to individuals with pronounced respiratory syndrome symptoms. Thus, there is a need for alternative, less expensive and more accessible tests. Methods We analyzed the plasma levels of white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), \u03B3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 207 patients who, after being admitted to the emergency room of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19 symptoms, were rRT-PCR tested. Of them, 105 tested positive, whereas 102 tested negative. Results Statistically significant differences were observed for WBC, CRP, AST, ALT and LDH. Empirical thresholds for AST and LDH allowed the identification of 70% of either COVID-19-positive or -negative patients on the basis of routine blood test results. Conclusions Combining appropriate cutoffs for certain hematological parameters could help in identifying false-positive/negative rRT-PCR tests. Blood test analysis might be used as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19-positive patients in those countries which suffer from a large shortage of rRT-PCR reagents and/or specialized laboratory.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferrari, Davide; Motta, Andrea; Strollo, Marta; Banfi, Giuseppe; Locatelli, Massimo","journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDH","AST"],"locations":["Milan"],"keyphrases":["negative rRT-PCR tests","PCR reagents","negative patients","positive patients","tested negative","AST","LDH","large shortage of rRT","false-positive","countries","COVID","false-negative rates","CRP","basis of routine blood test results","Blood test analysis","accessible tests","alternative","pronounced respiratory syndrome symptoms","expensive equipment","aspartate aminotransferase","alanine aminotransferase","plasma levels of white blood cells","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","need of certified laboratories","individuals","alkaline phosphatase","San Raffaele Hospital","GGT","WBCs","platelets","Italy","\u03B3-glutamyl transpeptidase","trained personnel","certain hematological parameters","C-reactive protein","appropriate cutoffs","Milan","lactate dehydrogenase","SARS-CoV","gold standard","Conclusions","emergency room","Objectives","confirmation of infection","Amplification of viral RNA","significant differences","long turnaround time","addition","specialized laboratory","Empirical thresholds","identification","infected people","deaths","date","Methods","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Concern for viral transmission necessitates the investigation of otologic procedures that use high-speed drilling instruments, including mastoidectomy, which we hypothesized to be an aerosol generating procedure. METHODS Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill was simulated using fresh-frozen cadaveric heads with fluorescein solution injected into the mastoid air cells. Specimens were drilled for one-minute durations in test conditions with and without a microscope. A barrier drape was fashioned from a commercially available drape (the OtoTent). Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60 cm in radius. RESULTS Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site. Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate. Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30 cm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall-Wallis test, p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment. A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jenny X; Workman, Alan D; Chari, Divya A; Jung, David H; Kozin, Elliott; Lee, Daniel J; Welling, D Bradley; Bleier, Benjamin S; Quesnel, Alicia M","journal":"Otology \u0026 neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microscope test conditions","OtoTent","octagonal test grid","particulate dispersion","particulate matter","reduced particle density","Kruskall-Wallis test","percent surface area","segments","high-speed drilling instruments","CONCLUSIONS Mastoidectomy","METHODS Mastoidectomy","simple barrier drape","available drape","aerosol","appropriate personal protective equipment","areas of highest density","higher levels of personal protective equipment","RESULTS Drilling","potential high risk of viral transmission","fluorescein solution","addition","investigation of otologic procedures","surgeon","effective mitigation strategy","fresh-frozen cadaveric heads","dramatic impact","quadrants","designation","degrees","fluorescent particles","global pandemic","study","varying irrigation rates","mastoid air cells","healthcare systems","minute durations","surgical site","Concern","radius","BACKGROUND COVID","Specimens","boundary"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to assess the accuracy of API in locating infarct core within large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Approach: Data were retrospectively collected for 25 LVO AIS patients who achieved successful recanalization. DSA data from lateral and anteroposterior (AP) views were loaded into API software to generate hemodynamic parameter maps. Relative differences in hemispherical regions for each API parameter were calculated. Ground truth infarct core locations were obtained using 24-h follow-up fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI imaging. FLAIR MRI infarct locations were registered with DSA images to determine infarct regions in API parameter maps. Relative differences across hemispheres for each API parameter were plotted against each other. A support vector machine was used to determine the optimal hyperplane for classifying regions as infarct or healthy tissue. Results: For the lateral and AP views, respectively, the most accurate classification of infarct regions came from plotting mean transit time (MTT) versus peak height (PH) [ accuracy = 0.8125 \u00B1 0.0012 (95%)], the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ( AUROC ) = 0.8946 \u00B1 0.0000 (95%), and plotting MTT versus the area under the curve (AUC) [ accuracy = 0.7957 \u00B1 0.0011 (95%), AUROC = 0.8759 \u00B1 0.0000 (95%)]. Conclusions: API provides accurate assessment of locating ischemic core in AIS LVO patients and has the potential for clinical benefit by determining infarct core location and growth in real time for intraoperative decision making.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rava, Ryan A; Mokin, Maxim; Snyder, Kenneth V; Waqas, Muhammad; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Davies, Jason M; Levy, Elad I; Ionita, Ciprian N","journal":"Journal of medical imaging","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jmi.7.1.016001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32064301/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DSA","AIS","API"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accuracy of API","API parameter maps","API software","accurate classification of infarct regions","FLAIR MRI infarct locations","ischemic core","Ground truth infarct core locations","LVO AIS patients","AIS LVO patients","hemispherical regions","MRI imaging","DSA data","hemodynamic parameter maps","DSA images","area","AP views","Relative differences","plotting MTT","AUROC","quantitative imaging method","angiographic parametric imaging","real time","accurate assessment","acute ischemic stroke","mean transit time","receiver operator characteristic curve","large vessel occlusion","growth","h follow-up fluid-attenuation inversion recovery","potential","digital subtraction angiography","peak height","clinical benefit","intraoperative decision making","hemodynamics","successful recanalization","hemispheres","optimal hyperplane","AUC","Conclusions","healthy tissue","support vector machine","Purpose","Biomarkers","Results","Approach"],"language":"en"},

High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been observed among older adults, and this has been widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN AND SETTINGS We obtained a representative sample of original tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020, containing the keywords \u0022elderly\u0022, \u0022older\u0022, and/or \u0022boomer\u0022 plus the hashtags \u0022#COVID19\u0022 and/or \u0022#coronavirus\u0022. MEASUREMENTS We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as: 1) informative; 2) personal accounts; 3) personal opinions; 4) advice seeking; 5) jokes; and 6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID-19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Seventy-seven tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone, while 21.1% had content which implied that the life of older adults was less valuable, or downplayed the relevance of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Most COVID-19 and older adults-related tweets contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost a quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content towards older adults. This article is protected by copyright.

Few information, dated back to almost two decades ago, exist as to whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) could reduce the islet-specific autoimmunity detected in patients at CD diagnosis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of GFD on 31 patients who presented islet-specific autoimmunity at CD diagnosis. METHODS CD patient sera collected at diagnosis and throughout the GFD were analyzed for the main humoral autoantibodies so far identified in T1D, directed against one or more among insulin, glutamic-acid decarboxylase, tyrosine-phosphatase 2 and zinc cation-efflux transporter autoantigens. RESULTS GFD (median duration 39 months) was associated to a decrease or disappearance of the islet-specific autoantibodies in 71% of CD patients. Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for \u22652 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis. These factors include the number of diabetes autoantibodies found at CD diagnosis, the adherence to the GFD, its duration and an asymptomatic clinical presentation of CD.

In children, allergy and asthma are among the most prevalent non-communicable chronic diseases, and health care providers taking care of these patients need guidance. At the current stage of knowledge, children have less severe symptoms of COVID-19, and severe asthma and immunodeficiency are classified as risk factors. In addition, there is no evidence that currently available asthma and allergy treatments, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19.

To date, there is no effective treatment. Clinical management is largely symptomatic, with organ support in intensive care for critically ill patients. The first phase I trial to test the efficacy of a vaccine has recently begun, but in the meantime there is an urgent need to decrease the morbidity and mortality of severe cases. It is known that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments. Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 could in some case induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with potentially fatal severe lung injury and patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome and viral ARDS result from uncontrolled severe acute inflammation. Acute lung injury results from inflammatory monocyte and macrophage activation in the pulmonary luminal epithelium which lead to a release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1. These cytokines play a crucial role in immune-related pneumonitis, and could represent a promising target when the infiltration is T cell predominant or there are indirect signs of high IL-6-related inflammation, such as elevated C-reactive protein. A monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab has been administered in a number of cases in China and Italy. Positive clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported. These early findings have led to an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial in China and Italy. While data from those trials are eagerly awaited, patients\u0027 management will continue to rely for the vast majority on local guidelines. Among many other aspects, this crisis has proven that different specialists must join forces to deliver the best possible care to patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Addeo, Alfredo; Obeid, Michel; Friedlaender, Alex","journal":"Journal for immunotherapy of cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-000892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","ill patients","uncontrolled severe acute inflammation","mortality of severe cases","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Clinical management","Acute lung injury results","fatal severe lung injury","Cytokine release syndrome","related inflammation","China","monoclonal anti-IL","Italy","number of cases","SARS-CoV","indirect signs of high IL","immune-related pneumonitis","release of proinflammatory cytokines","ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial","viral ARDS","intensive care","novel coronavirus","effective treatment","patients\u0027 management","aberrant non-effective host immune responses","pulmonary luminal epithelium","best possible care","increased risk of pulmonary complications","macrophage activation","inflammatory monocyte","T cell predominant","malignancy","infiltration","forces","systemic immunosuppressive state","individuals","organ support","receptor antibody","crucial role","morbidity","promising target","elevated C-reactive protein","COVID","tocilizumab","infection","interleukin","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","urgent need","crisis","vast majority","local guidelines","different specialists","trials","efficacy","radiological outcomes","anticancer treatments","early findings","meantime","date","phase","aspects","data","vaccine"],"language":"en"},

The biggest challenge of achieving good infant pain control is obtaining objective pain assessment when direct communication is lacking. For years, computer scientists have developed many different facial expression-centred machine learning (ML) methods for automatic infant pain assessment. Many of these ML algorithms showed rather satisfactory performance and have demonstrated good potential to be further enhanced for implementation in real-world clinical settings. To date, there is no prior research that has systematically summarised and compared the performance of these ML algorithms. Our proposed meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive evidence on this topic to guide further ML algorithm development and clinical implementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search four major public electronic medical and computer science databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and IEEE Xplore Digital Library from January 2008 to present. All the articles will be imported into the Covidence platform for study eligibility screening and inclusion. Study-level extracted data will be stored in the Systematic Review Data Repository online platform. The primary outcome will be the prediction accuracy of the ML model. The secondary outcomes will be model utility measures including generalisability, interpretability and computational efficiency. All extracted outcome data will be imported into RevMan V.5.2.1 software and R V3.3.2 for analysis. Risk of bias will be summarised using the latest Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review and meta-analysis will only use study-level data from public databases, thus formal ethical approval is not required.

Methods: Literature on novel coronavirus pneumonia was retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE databases. The relevant data was extracted and a meta-analysis was performed using StatsDirect statistical software V.2.8.0 to calculate the combined odds ratio. Results: Seven studies were included, consisting of 1594 cases. The meta-analysis result showed that the most common clinical symptoms of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were fever (91.6%) and cough (64.5%), followed by dyspnea (32.8%) and sputum (28.1%). Headache (10.5%), sore throat (11.2%), hemoptysis (3.2%), diarrhea (6.6%) and the other symptoms were relatively rare. Aspartate aminotransferase (29%), alanine transaminase (22.7%), and total bilirubin (11.7%) levels were elevated, except for serum albumin levels (80.4%). The common therapeutic agents used were antibiotics (87.7%), antiviral drugs (75.5%), and glucocorticoids (26.6%), while antifungal agents (7.7%) were used in few. Mechanical ventilation (13.4%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1.9%), and continuous renal replacement therapy (3.8%) were used in severe cases.

Most studies have investigated short-term responses of organisms to unrealistically high concentrations of pesticides; however, chronic exposure to persistent low concentrations, which are more likely to occur in the environment, are rarely analyzed. Here, we tested the response of polyps of the Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita, to environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticide chlorpyrifos, individually and in combination, over nine weeks. We hypothesized that exposure to individual pesticides would reduce rates of asexual reproduction and alter polyps\u0027 metabolite profiles, and that the results would be more severe when polyps were exposed to the combined pesticides. Polyps survived and reproduced (through budding) in all treatments and no differences among treatments were observed. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy revealed no difference in profiles of polar metabolites of polyps exposed to the individual or combined pesticides. Our results suggest that A. aurita polyps are unaffected by chronic exposure to atrazine and chlorpyrifos at concentrations recommended as being protective by current Australian water quality guidelines.

A mechanistic model that accounts for flow and temperature effects yielded a fair estimate of the effective exchange surface area (12.5 \u00B1 0.8 cm2 ). This model could only be tested for higher flow velocities because of uncertainties associated with the measurement of flow velocities \u003C 1 cm/s.

On average participants with severe visual losses perceived sounds to be twice as far away, and rooms to be three times larger, than sighted controls. Distance estimates for sighted controls were most accurate for closer sounds and least accurate for farther sounds. As the severity of visual impairment increased, accuracy decreased for closer sounds and increased for farther sounds. However, it is for closer sounds that accurate judgments are needed to guide rapid motor responses to auditory events, e.g. planning a safe path through a busy street to avoid collisions with other people, and falls.

We aim to explore the potential role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in this regard through this literature review. As a crucial enzyme of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 not only mediates the virus entry but also affects the pathophysiological process of virus-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as other organs\u0027 damage. As interaction of COVID-19 virus spike and ACE2 is essential for virus infection, COVID-19-specific vaccine based on spike protein, small molecule compound interrupting their interaction, human monoclonal antibody based on receptor-binding domain, and recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhuACE2) have aroused the interests of researchers. Meanwhile, ACE2 could catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to form angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), thus alleviates the harmful effect of Ang II and amplifies the protection effect of Ang1-7. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and could be potential strategies in protecting lungs, heart, and kidneys. ACE2 plays a very important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection.

OBJECTIVE The goal of this review was to describe the current classification for emerging porcine biological pathogen transmission through the feed supply chain so resources can be best directed towards those of highest risk. METHODS By assessing the pathogen severity to pigs and the probability of pathogen transmission through feed, an overall risk can be established using a hazard analysis matrix. RESULTS There is negligible risk for feed-based transmission of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, Trichinella spiralis, Toxoplasma gondii, Salmonella Choleraesuis, Salmonella spp. except Choleraesuis and I 4,[5],12:i:-, porcine deltacoronavirus, Senecavirus A, mammalian orthoreovirus 3, foot and mouth disease virus, classical swine fever virus or Chinese pseudorabies virus. However, the combined severity and probability of Salmonella enterica serotype I 4,[5],12:i:-, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus and African swine fever virus warrant a moderate risk characterization for transmission through the US feed supply chain. CONCLUSIONS This risk can be maintained below critical status by minimizing the likelihood that a pathogen can enter the feed supply chain, such as by excluding high-risk ingredients from facilities, extending biosecurity to mills, and considering proactive mitigation strategies. In reality, all these actions may be necessary to prevent the detrimental transmission of porcine biological hazards into the US swine herd through the feed supply chain.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Cassandra K; Woodworth, Jason; Dritz, Steve S; Paulk, Chad B","journal":"Veterinary medicine and science","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/vms3.227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31854118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella Choleraesuis","Choleraesuis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feed mills","feed-based transmission","feed vehicle","US feed supply chain","emerging porcine biological pathogen transmission","probability of pathogen transmission","detrimental transmission of porcine biological hazards","classical swine fever virus","African swine fever virus","porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","porcine deltacoronavirus","pathogen severity","negligible risk","overall risk","highest risk","mouth disease virus","US swine herd","Salmonella Choleraesuis","Chinese pseudorabies virus","domestic swine herd","moderate risk characterization","probability of Salmonella enterica","combined severity","emerging threat of foreign animal disease","Trichinella spiralis","Toxoplasma gondii","transmissible spongiform encephalopathy","current classification","mammalian orthoreovirus","foot","decades","biosecurity","review","Senecavirus","potential","high-risk ingredients","facilities","concern","likelihood","critical status","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","resources","proactive mitigation strategies","hazard analysis matrix","actions","OBJECTIVE","goal","METHODS","reality","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein in turn lead to the cross species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2, may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modelling. The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein respectively. Despite strong overall structural similarities, spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared to the wild type molecule. Most ACE2 variants showed similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein. In summary, our data provide structural basis of potential resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by ACE2 allelic variants. This article is protected by copyright.

The early detection of this pathology is very helpful for minimizing the chances of stroke, other heart-related disorders, and coronary artery diseases. This paper proposes a novel method for the detection of AF pathology based on the analysis of the ECG signal. The method adopts a multi-rate cosine filter bank architecture for the evaluation of coefficients from the ECG signal at different subbands, in turn, the Fractional norm (FN) feature is evaluated from the extracted coefficients at each subband. Then, the AF detection is carried out using a deep learning approach known as the Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (H-ELM) from the FN features. The proposed method is evaluated by considering normal and AF pathological ECG signals from public databases. The experimental results reveal that the proposed multi-rate cosine filter bank based on FN features is effective for the detection of AF pathology with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 99.40%, 98.77%, and 100%, respectively. The performance of the proposed diagnostic features of the ECG signal is compared with other existing features for the detection of AF. The low-frequency subband FN features found to be more significant with a difference of the mean values as 0.69 between normal and AF classes.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, S K; Tripathy, R K; Paternina, Mario R A; Arrieta, Juan J; Zamora-Mendez, Alejandro; Naik, Ganesh R","journal":"Journal of medical systems","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-020-01565-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AF","Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine","FN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AF detection","detection of AF pathology","AF classes","AF pathological ECG signals","proposed diagnostic features","existing features","proposed method","early detection","low-frequency subband FN features","proposed multi-rate cosine filter bank","novel method","multi-rate cosine filter bank architecture","evaluation of coefficients","extracted coefficients","mean values","specificity values","Atrial fibrillation","deep learning approach","abnormal atrial patterns","Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine","turn","H-ELM","accuracy","heart-related disorders","different subbands","public databases","sensitivity","Fractional norm","coronary artery diseases","chances of stroke","analysis","experimental results","difference","performance","electrocardiogram","cardiac arrhythmia","paper","irregsular"],"language":"en"},

Previously, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV-encoded ORF8b strongly inhibits MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated induction of the interferon beta (IFN-\u03B2) promoter activities. Here, we report that ORF8b seem to regulate MDA5 or RIG-I differentially as protein levels of MDA5 were significantly down-regulated while those of RIG-I were largely unperturbed. In addition, ORF8b seemed to efficiently suppress phosphorylation of IRF3 at the residues of 386 and 396 in cells transfected with RIG-I while total endogenous levels of IRF3 remained largely unchanged. Furthermore, ORF8b was able to inhibit all forms of RIG-I; full-length, RIG-I-1-734, and RIG-I-1-228, last of which contains only the CARD domains. Taken together, it is tempting to postulate that ORF8b may interfere with the CARD-CARD interactions between RIG-I and MAVS.

Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity. The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%). County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms. When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic. The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available.

This study was undertaken to test the association of TNF-\u03B1 - 308 and IFN-\u03B3 \u002B 874 gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility of Leishmania (L) species among CL patients in central region of Saudi Arabia. METHODS This is a case-control study involved 169 Saudi subjects with different L. species and 199 healthy controls from central region of Saudi Arabia. All subjects were characterized by TNF-\u03B1 - 308 G/A and IFN-\u03B3 \u002B 874 A/T gene polymorphisms using PCR. RESULTS Evaluation of genotyping and allelic frequency of TNF-\u03B1 - 308 G/A in different L. species showed no significant association compared to controls (p \u003E 0.05). Except, in cases of L. tropica that showed significantly higher TNF-\u03B1 - 308 A versus G allele frequency (p = 0.0004). Evaluation of genotyping of IFN-\u03B3 \u002B 874 (TT versus AA\u002BAT recessive) and allelic frequency of IFN-\u03B3 \u002B 874 (T versus A) showed significant higher in L. major and also in total CL cases as compared to healthy controls (p \u003C 0.05). Furthermore, a strong association was observed between the susceptibility of L. major, L. tropica or total CL cases with synergistically combined high TNF-\u03B1 308/INF-\u03B3 874 alleles. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report that shows the gene polymorphisms of TNF-\u03B1 - 308 G/A and IFN-\u03B3 \u002B 874 A/T in Saudi patients with different L. species infections. Data showed that the TNF-\u03B1-308 G/A gene polymorphism is not associated with the susceptibility of CL in Saudi subjects.

In order to account for novel modifications, we need to search all the spectra against all the peptides using a joint probabilistic model that can be learned from training data. Assuming M spectra and N possible peptides, currently the state of the art search methods have runtime of O(MN). Here, we propose a novel bucketing method that sends pairs with high likelihood under the joint probabilistic model to the same bucket with higher probability than those pairs with low likelihood. We demonstrate that the runtime of this method grows sub-linearly with the data size, and our results show that our method is orders of magnitude faster than methods from the locality sensitive hashing literature.

In word equation problem we are given an equation [Formula: see text], where both u and v are words of letters and variables, and ask for a substitution of variables by words that equalizes the sides of the equation. The recompression technique is based on employing simple compression rules (replacement of two letters ab by a new letter c, replacement of maximal repetitions of a by a new letter), and modifying the equations (replacing a variable X by bX or Xa) so that those operations are sound and complete. The simple analysis focuses on the size of the instance and not on the combinatorial properties of words that are used. The recompression-based algorithm for word equations runs in nondeterministic linear space. The approach turned out to be quite robust and can be applied to various generalized, simplified and related problems, in particular, to problems in the area of grammar compressed words.

Some of the viral diseases can be cured by approved antiviral drugs, but for others still do not have any vaccines or drugs available. Most of the approved antiviral drugs are somehow directly or indirectly associated with side effects, which eventually raise the need for the development of antivirals based on natural phytochemicals. Globally, the development of antivirals is shifting towards the plant-derived products as they are less toxic and has less chance to develop resistance. Phytochemicals have been exploited traditionally for the cure of many diseases, and also have been reported to inhibit viral replication/transcription. Most of them inhibit the viruses either during the viral entry inside the host cell or during their replication. Moreover, 50% of the drugs derived from plants are being used in the Western nations. Plants have a variety of phytochemicals like flavonoids, terpenoids, lignins, alkaloids, and coumarins that are having antioxidant activity, and help to inhibit viral genome. Various plant-derived products have been well studied against viruses like herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and hepatitis virus. More recently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a newly identified coronavirus has become pandemic, and affected world\u2019s population severely.

In this chapter, we will emphasize on the reported phytochemicals and their derivatives, having antiviral properties and their mechanism to treat viral diseases.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghildiyal, Ritu; Prakash, Vijeta; Chaudhary, V.

This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit\u2013risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient\u2019s individualized situation.

Fungal pathogens are proved to be a common and popular contaminant of agroecosystem that approximately causes 70\u201380% of total microbial crop loss. To meet the proper global increasing need of food products as a result of population explosion, managing agricultural system in an eco-friendly and profitable manner is the prime target; thus the word \u201Csustainable agriculture\u201D plays it part, and this package is highly effective when coupled with nature-derived fungicidal products that can minimize the event of fungal infections in agrarian ecosystem. Present study enlists the most common and effective natural products that might be of plant or microbial origin, their mode of action, day-by-day development of phytopathogenic resistance against the prevailing fungicides, and also their role in maintenance of sustainability of agricultural practices with special emphasis on their acceptance over the synthetic or chemical one. A large number of bioactive compounds ranging from direct plant (both cryptogams algae and moss and phanerogams)-derived natural extracts, essential oil of aromatic plants, and low-molecular-weight antimicrobial compounds known as phytoalexins to secondary metabolites that are both volatile and nonvolatile organic compounds of microbes (fungal and actinobacterial members) residing inside the host tissue, called endophyte, are widely used as agricultural bioweapons.

Memory effects in the pattern of interactions among individuals are also known to affect how diffusive and spreading phenomena take place. In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models on the recently introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based mean-field approach, we derive, in the long-time limit, analytical predictions for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR dynamics, therefore favoring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long-time asymptotic regime. Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated temporal networks.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tizzani, Michele; Lenti, Simone; Ubaldi, Enrico; Vezzani, Alessandro; Castellano, Claudio; Burioni, Raffaella","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dd0c46c0f436b67eae701caafc66dc121dd58fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic threshold","epidemic dynamics","epidemic spreading","Memory effects","epidemic control","susceptible-infected","preasymptotic regime","activity-driven networks","SIR dynamics","SIS","long-time asymptotic regime","correlated temporal networks","Strong aging effects","long-time limit","theoretical approach","starting time","activity-based mean-field approach","model-dependent preasymptotic corrections","Time-varying network topologies","numerical simulations","understanding","ingredients","analytical predictions","distribution of activities","parameters","pattern of interactions","strength","function","dynamical processes","combined effect","origin","models","phenomena","place","paper","individuals","epidemics","results"],"language":"en"},

The static (static polymer\u2013polymer correlation length (mesh size), associates of cross-links and PVP microchains) and dynamic (polymer chain relaxation rate, hydrodynamic polymer\u2013polymer correlation length) structural elements were determined. The incorporation of titania nanoparticles into PVP hydrogel slightly increases the size of structural inhomogeneities (an increase in the static and dynamic polymer\u2013polymer correlation length, the formation of associates of cross-links and PVP chains). Titania nanoparticles have an impact on the microstructure of the composite hydrogel and form associates with sizes from 0.5 to 2 \u00B5m attached to PVP hydrogel pore walls. The PVP and TN/PVP hydrogels show a high degree of water swelling. Moreover, the presence of titania nanoparticles in TN/PVP increases the number of water adsorption cycles compared to PVP hydrogel. The high swelling degree, bacteria-resistant and antimicrobial properties against Staphylococcus aureus allow considering NT/PVP hydrogels for medical applications as wound coatings.","publish_time":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Timaeva, Olesya; Pashkin, Igor; Mulakov, Sergey; Kuzmicheva, Galina; Konarev, Petr; Terekhova, Raisa; Sadovskaya, Natalia; Czakkel, Orsolya; Prevost, Sylvain","journal":"J Mater Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba7d08ead7f5a4c2b1b375f5f92a72df765b3d50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222127.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222127/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PVP","TN/PVP"],"locations":["Titania"],"keyphrases":["PVP hydrogels","PVP microchains","PVP chains","static polymer","polymer correlation length","hydrodynamic polymer","PVP hydrogel pore walls","TN","incorporation of titania nanoparticles","presence of titania nanoparticles","polymer chain relaxation rate","associates of cross-links","composite hydrogel","based hydrogels","formation of associates","form associates","high degree of water","high swelling degree","constant weight","size of structural inhomogeneities","neutron scattering","mesh size","structural elements","neutron spin-echo","number of water adsorption cycles","bacteria-resistant","small-angle X-ray","Staphylococcus aureus","antimicrobial properties","medical applications","increase","spectroscopy","NSE","sizes","microstructure","powder","\u00B5m","wound coatings","N-vinyl pyrrolidone","time","various methods","impact","different states","gel method","sol","ground","electron microscopy"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the molecular organization of palmitic acid (PA) films on alkaline buffer solutions (pH 7.4) with and without divalent Ca2\u002B was measured at a constant surface area using Langmuir troughs coupled with microscopy and X-ray interfacial techniques. Without Ca2\u002B, PA molecules remained a monolayer organization; however, with Ca2\u002B, formation of the inverted bilayers of PA-Ca2\u002B superstructures caused a spontaneous 2D to 3D transformation under no compression due to the strong interaction between PA and the divalent cation. Self-assembly of this highly-organized inverted bilayer superstructure involved a two-step process of nucleation and nuclei growth. During nucleation, densely packed PA and Ca2\u002B monolayer firstly corrugated and some of PA and Ca2\u002B molecules ejected out from the monolayer; the ejected molecules then reorganized and formed the inverted bilayer nuclei. Nucleation was followed by nuclei growth, during which PA and Ca2\u002B in the monolayer kept integrating into the inverted bilayer structure through molecule migration and PA rotation around Ca2\u002B.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Pin; Pham, Tiep; Zheng, Xin; Liu, Chang; Plata, Paola Leon; Kr\u00E1l, Petr; Bu, Wei; Lin, Binhua; Liu, Ying","journal":"Colloids and surfaces.

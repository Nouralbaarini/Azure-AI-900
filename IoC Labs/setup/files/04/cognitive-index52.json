The microbiological quality of laboratory animals is a direct result of colony management practices, and monitoring provides an after-the-fact assessment of the adequacy of those practices. In the case of immunocompromised animals or in infection experiments, however, monitoring for a comprehensive list of micro-organisms is reasonable. The testing of animals usually starts with necropsy and blood sampling for serology, followed by microscopic examination for parasites and sampling of organs for bacteriology, pathology, and, in rare cases, virological examinations. Biological materials represent a high risk, if they originate from or have been propagated in animals. In particular, tumors, viruses, or parasites that are serially passaged in animals often pick up pathogens, and therefore a high percentage of these are contaminated. It has been shown in mice and rats that all preimplantational stages can be revitalized successfully upon freezethaw procedures. For long-term storage, eight-cell stages have been recommended in the chapter, while two-cell stages were considered to be less suitable. One embryo batch (inbred strain) derived from a single pedigree donor pair may be regarded as a prospective breeding nucleus, if one fertile breeding pair is obtained upon revitalization. Assuming an average revitalization rate of 20% (fertile breeders), one embryo batch should contain a minimum number of 10 embryos to obtain at least one breeding pair with a 50% chance of revitalization.","publish_time":"2008-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mossmann, H; Nicklas, W; Hedrich, Hj","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected animals","testing of animals","fertile breeding pair","case of immunocompromised animals","cell stages","microbiological quality of laboratory animals","embryo batch","parasites","preimplantational stages","chance of revitalization","chapter","monitoring","prospective breeding nucleus","average revitalization rate","sampling of organs","fertile breeders","blood sampling","management of immunocompromized","single pedigree donor pair","high percentage","high risk","direct result of colony management practices","pathology","serology","microscopic examination","necropsy","inbred strain","rare cases","minimum number","bacteriology","embryos","infection experiments","comprehensive list of micro-organisms","virological examinations","adequacy","Biological materials","tumors","viruses","mice","rats","long-term storage","pathogens","fact assessment","freezethaw procedures"],"language":"en"},

First, both glial and neuronal cells normally do not express molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. Second, the most efficient cells for stimulating an immune response (leucocyte dendritic cells) are not present in the healthy CNS; and third, there is no specialized lymphatic drainage from the CNS to lymph nodes to enable the immune system to be quickly informed of the presence of an infection. Nevertheless, the immune system apparently copes with the vast majority of viral infections in the CNS. This is clearly evidenced by the reactivation of latent CNS viral infections in some immunosuppressed patients and the dramatic increase in the seventy of CNS disease in young or otherwise immunologically incompetent experimental animals infected with neurotropic viruses. The routes by which the CNS and the immune system may communicate and the varied ways in which an immune response may affect the outcome of a viral infection of the CNS are discussed.","publish_time":"2004-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sedgwick, Jonathon D.; D\u00F6rries, R\u00FCdiger","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS disease","healthy CNS","immune system","immune response","reactivation of latent CNS viral infections","neuronal cells","efficient cells","vast majority of viral infections","leucocyte dendritic cells","immunosuppressed patients","express molecules","incompetent experimental animals","lymph nodes","dramatic increase","varied ways","neurotropic viruses","major histocompatibility complex","ability","specialized lymphatic drainage","outcome","severe disadvantage","immunological terms","presence","routes"],"language":"en"},

As the challenges of the world increasingly transcend borders, so too have researchers and innovators forged international coalitions to resolve global pathologies. In doing so, new channels of influence and opportunity have opened up for states alongside the \u2018traditional\u2019 modes of foreign diplomacy. Understanding how these channels influence global socio-economic outcomes is thereby crucial for scholars interested in the still-ambiguous structure and processes of global governance. This article advances understanding of the domains of science diplomacy by drawing attention to the \u2018political intercostalities\u2019 of state actors, scientific communities and other transnational actors within the new architectures of global governance. Here we trace the growing array of informal international associations alongside transgovernmental policy networks and \u2018global public-policy partnerships\u2019 that deal with highly specialised and technical matters of international policy and how they are drawn into science diplomacy. This article thus presents a research agenda for a particular mode of \u2018impact\u2019 in politics and international studies.","publish_time":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Legrand, Timothy; Stone, Diane","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a14e3705ee7586d782041068863fff7cb734746.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global pathologies","processes of global governance","domains of science diplomacy","international coalitions","global public-policy partnerships\u2019","international studies","new architectures of global governance","global socio-economic outcomes","technical matters of international policy","modes of foreign diplomacy","new channels of influence","article","understanding","transgovernmental policy networks","growing array of informal international associations","transnational actors","state actors","scientific communities","impact","attention","formidable dimension of interstate power relations","particular mode","political intercostalities","ambiguous structure","scholars","research agenda","politics","researchers","opportunity","innovators","borders","states","challenges","world"],"language":"en"},

There has not been any systematic empirical study of the dynamics of emerging coordination behaviour and knowledge transfer process during a disease outbreak. In this paper, we first introduce our approach for the analysis of multi-agency intervention during a disease outbreak using the study of social networks. Using social networks and its analytic framework, we explore questions such as: How does the multi-agency coordination emerge for supporting the complex knowledge transfer process during different phases of disease outbreak? How effective are these formal and informal coordination mechanisms in achieving a robust outcome in response coordination through effective knowledge transfer process during the outbreak? What are the key lessons learned by studying the emerging coordination and knowledge transfer process during past disease outbreak in improving the multi-agency preparedness for dealing with future outbreaks? The discussion is supported by a qualitative study of the implementation of the results of the analysis. We reveal that profound understanding of social network behaviour and emerging coordination concepts are pivotal to the optimisation of knowledge transfer process which is a prerequisite for successful outbreak intervention. We look qualitatively at how Hunter New England Area Health Services applied these concepts to lead a successful coordination plan during an H1N109 endemic.","publish_time":"2012-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bdeir, Fadl; Hossain, Liaquat; Crawford, John","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef6be7e1bf12cbf1d85086ad673825fbd7427231.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hunter New England Area Health Services"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multi-agency coordination","response coordination","coordination of actions","emerging coordination concepts","past disease outbreak","effective knowledge transfer process","complex knowledge transfer process","optimisation of knowledge transfer process","successful coordination plan","successful outbreak intervention","dynamics of emerging coordination behaviour","different phases of disease outbreak","informal coordination mechanisms","study of social networks","analysis of multi-agency intervention","multi-agency preparedness","qualitative study","systematic empirical study","profound understanding of social network behaviour","robust outcome","Hunter New England Area Health Services","prerequisite","implementation","analytic framework","H1N109 endemic","approach","SARS","future outbreaks","results","multiple agencies","key lessons","questions","time","discussion","paper"],"language":"en"},

The complexity of mutant spectra can influence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fidelity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are influenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fitness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fitness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fitness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fitness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival. This chapter reviews the basic principles of quasispecies dynamics as they can serve to explain the behavior of viruses.","publish_time":"2008-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban; Escarm\u00EDs, Cristina; Men\u00E9ndez-Arias, Luis; Perales, Celia; Herrera, M\u00F3nica; Novella, Isabel S.; Holland, John J.","journal":"Origin and Evolution of Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149507.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral quasispecies","fitness gains","virus population dynamics","higher fitness","virus variants","virus extinction","Fitness variations","viral pathogenesis","fitness effects of mutations","sharp transition of virus populations","Quasispecies theory","average fitness decreases","competitive optimization of large viral populations","interfering mutant genomes","disease potential","basic principles of quasispecies dynamics","replicating mutant spectrum","complexity of mutant spectra","variant genomes","adaptive potential","parental population","enhanced mutagenesis","disease progression","selective constraints","lethal mutagenesis","replicative capacity","behavior of viruses","compensatory effect of mutations","resistance of pathogenic viruses","increased replicative fidelity","repeated bottleneck events","insights","error catastrophe","replication of subpopulations","mutants resistant","key event","multiple antiretroviral inhibitors","conceptual framework","progressive enrichment","response","passage regimes","selection of HIV","antiviral agents","presence","components","compendium","chapter","ensemble","molecular intricacies","interference","Complementation","survival"],"language":"en"},

Two case studies are provided to highlight functions of the IBC which are not mandated, yet are critical for safe and responsible research. There are also types of biohazardous work that are currently unregulated and receive no review from an IBC or other group of subject matter experts, leaving a gap in safety oversight. To mitigate the hazard of working with potentially hazardous unregulated biological material, the necessity of performing a risk assessment and of performing a hazard review by subject matter experts, such as those on an IBC, is of paramount importance.","publish_time":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rainer, David; Cook, Susan","journal":"Ensuring National Biosecurity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149535.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Institutional Biosafety Committees","IBC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["oversight of biohazardous research","hazard review","research entities","responsible research","biohazardous materials","biohazardous work","safety oversight","group of subject matter experts","hazardous unregulated biological material","necessity","use","significant expertise","standing body","regulations","federal policies","mandate","advantage","gap","additional responsibilities","Institutional Biosafety Committees","IBCs","United States","risk assessment","functions","industry","case studies","paramount importance"],"language":"en"},

There is evidence for the plausibility of psychosocial influences on infectious disease in humans as well as evidence for a role of stress in determining susceptibility for a small number of infectious agents. Little is known about the characteristics of psychosocial factors that increase or decrease risk of disease onset and progression and of the nature of behavioral, endocrine, and immune changes that are responsible for psychosocial-induced changes in disease risk. Until there is more empirical evidence for specific mechanisms linking psychosocial factors to infectious disease, there would be little real understanding of the extent to which evidence deriving from present work generalizes to other disease models. It is likely that the following years would result in an understanding of the relations between psychosocial factors and immunity, the mechanisms that link psychosocial influence to immune change, and the range of immune function that is subject to alteration.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, Sheldon","journal":"Handbook of Human Stress and Immunity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150128.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious disease","disease risk","characteristics of psychosocial factors","disease models","plausibility of psychosocial influences","psychosocial-induced changes","risk of disease onset","immune changes","empirical evidence","immunity","humans","small number of infectious agents","range of immune function","little real understanding","specific mechanisms","susceptibility","progression","extent","nature of behavioral","present work","endocrine","relations","role of stress","following years","alteration","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The virions are enveloped and bacilliform in shape with rounded ends, where the envelope is studded with prominent peplomers projecting approximately 11 nm from the surface. The nucleocapsids are 20\u201330 nm in diameter and have a helical symmetry with coil periodicity of 5\u20137 nm. Long filamentous nucleocapsid precursors occur in the cytoplasm of infected cells and acquire envelopes by budding at endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The virions are sensitive to calcium hypochlorite and sodium dodecyl-sulfate, but sensitivity to other treatments is not known. The virions possess a lipid envelope derived from endoplasmic membranes of host cells. Compared to the genomes of vertebrate nidoviruses, the okavirus genome is unique in that the nucleoprotein gene (ORF2) is located upstream of the glycoprotein gene (ORF3), there is no discrete gene encoding a structural membrane (M) protein, and the virion envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 are generated by proteolysis of a pp3 precursor polyprotein encoded by the ORF3 gene. Okaviruses have been detected only in crustaceans and their geographic range mirrors that of its primary penaeid host, extending across the Indo-Pacific from Eastern Africa, Southern and Southeast Asia, and Australia to islands in the South Pacific. Infections have also been detected recently in blue shrimp (P. stylirostris) from the Gulf of California, and they may be chronic or acute and transmitted horizontally or vertically.","publish_time":"2011-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Virus Taxonomy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150143.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern Africa","Southern","Australia","South Pacific"],"keyphrases":["nm","ORF3 gene","virions","nucleoprotein gene","discrete gene","glycoprotein gene","lipid envelope","endoplasmic membranes of host cells","endoplasmic reticulum membranes","virion envelope glycoproteins gp116","okavirus genome","Indo-Pacific","South Pacific","primary penaeid host","cytoplasm of infected cells","sodium dodecyl-sulfate","Southeast Asia","Australia","Eastern Africa","calcium hypochlorite","envelopes","Roniviridae family","sole member genus","proteolysis","geographic range mirrors","islands","gp64","pp3 precursor polyprotein","helical symmetry","prominent peplomers projecting","stylirostris","crustaceans","sensitivity","genomes of vertebrate nidoviruses","bacilliform","shape","coil periodicity","rounded ends","structural membrane","filamentous nucleocapsid precursors","chapter","diameter","Gulf of California","blue shrimp","treatments","surface","ORF2","Okaviruses","nucleocapsids","Infections"],"language":"en"},

A total of 35 species of chydorids was recovered; 3 species were new for Denmark, while 3 others previously reported from Danish lakes were not found. The lakes sampled were subjectively grouped according to physical\u2014chemical measurements into 1 of 3 groups\u2013clear\u2014water lakes (1), ponds and bogs (2) and polluted, clear\u2014water lakes (3). Correlations between chydorids and chemical\u2014physical properties of lakes, plus evidence from relative abundances and frequencies of each species found in each lake type, suggests that most species prefer those waters best termed oligotrophic and dystrophic. The exceptions of Chydorus sphaericus and Alona rectangula which, when found in high percentages, typify eutrophic or polluted sites. These data correlated well with species diversity values\u2013high values were found in clear\u2014water lakes (1) and ponds and bogs (2), while low diversities were typical of polluted sites (3). These data suggested that species diversity is a function of available habitat (rooted aquatics), and hence to a large extent the distribution of most chydorid species within a region is determined by habitat diversity (structure). Grane Langso (an oligotrophic, Jutlandic lake) and Esrom S\u00B0 (an eutrophic, Zealandic lake) were selected for paleo\u2014studies because of their differences, which resulted in contrasting lake development. Postglacial gyttja sediment in Grane Langso extended to 431 cm below the mud\u2014water surface interface. Pollen zonation, and a radiocarbon date of \u00B19500 BP placed the lowest organic deposits into Pre\u2014Boreal time. Two chydorid species were important in Grane Langso Late\u2014glacial sands underlying the gyttja (Alona affinis and Chydorus sphaericus). Chydorid faunas developed through the Pre\u2014Boreal and early Boreal; by late Boreal chydorid populations were most diverse, and presumably stable. A decrease in species diversity during Atlantic time was due to unstable conditions within the lake, evidenced by deposition of sand; Chydorus piger was abundant during this period. Sub\u2014Boreal organic deposits overlay the Atlantic sands. High percentages of Pleuroxus during mid\u2014Sub\u2014Boreal were attributed to man\u0027s activity, and a lower water level. The most recent change in chydorid assemblages occurred within the past 100 yrs; this change was increased percentages of Alonella nana\u2013a species normally associated with low alkalinities in Denmark. Postglacial calcareous gyttja deposits in Esrom So extended to 380 cm below the mud water interface. Calcareous clay extended from 381\u2014840 cm, and glacial till occurred below 840 cm. Pollen preservation was poor in Esrom, but the lowermost gyttja was probably Pre\u2014Boreal (Zone IV). No pollen counts were attributable to Zone VI. Few chydorid remains were found in Late\u2014glacial clays, and extensive development of populations began in Pre\u2014Boreal time (370 cm). Chydorid assemblages characteristic of discriminant Group 1 were present throughout most of the postglacial deposits; benthic species were prevalent during most of the lake\u0027s history. Littoral forms did increase in Sub\u2014Boreal time, but by Sub\u2014Atlantic chydorid assemblages were again dominated by benthic groups. In Esrom, postglacial chydorid fluctuations were dampened by its morphological and chemical characteristics, while Grane Langso fossil assemblages were sensitive to minor variations in the lake\u0027s environs. Pioneer chydorid species in northern Europe are Chydorus sphaericus, Alona affinis, A. quadrangularis, Acroperus harpae, and Alonella nana.","publish_time":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whiteside, Melbourne C.","journal":"Ecol Monogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8de25ef15eecadcb5fff424d1b8c14d8af8c0bea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Grane Langso","Esrom S\u00B0","Chydorus"],"organizations":["BP","Group","Pioneer"],"locations":["Atlantic","Alonella","Denmark","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Pioneer chydorid species","species of chydorids","benthic species","Boreal time","water lakes","species diversity values","late Boreal chydorid populations","Atlantic chydorid assemblages","Chydorid faunas","postglacial chydorid fluctuations","Boreal organic deposits","relationships of species occurrence","Danish lakes","postglacial deposits","Sub","lake type","Chydorid assemblages characteristic of discriminant Group","Atlantic time","Postglacial calcareous gyttja deposits","Jutlandic lake","Zealandic lake","physical properties of lakes","mud water interface","Grane Langso fossil assemblages","habitat diversity","Postglacial gyttja sediment","contrasting lake development","water surface interface","exceptions of Chydorus sphaericus","lower water level","Alona affinis","Chydorus piger","Atlantic sands","high values","lowermost gyttja","Esrom S","glacial sands","lowest organic deposits","High percentages of Pleuroxus","Alona rectangula","chemical characteristics","increased percentages of Alonella nana","chemical measurements","glacial clays","eutrophic","typical of polluted sites","benthic groups","Pollen zonation","pollen counts","Pollen preservation","ponds","data","Denmark","bogs","extensive development of populations","low diversities","recent change","low alkalinities","lake\u0027s environs","Zone IV","lake\u0027s history","Calcareous clay","function of available habitat","northern Europe","minor variations","evidence","quadrangularis","Acroperus harpae","BP","yrs","relative abundances","man\u0027s activity","deposition of sand","rooted aquatics","radiocarbon date","differences","paleo","frequencies","waters","unstable conditions","distribution","purpose","decrease","region","large extent","period","Surficial sediments","Correlations","Littoral forms","studies","structure","total"],"language":"en"},

SUMMARY: Attempts to develop an immunoprophylaxis against Transmissible Gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs III. Passive immune transfer after oral vaccination with the attenuated TGE virus strain Bl Using the TGE virus strain Bl that had been attenuated during 300 passages in porcine thyroid cell cultures 14 pregnant sows were orally and oronasally immunized twice \u2014 5 and 2 weeks before parturition. The application of the vaccine was carried out in acid\u2010stable capsules. All sows developed antibodies against TGE virus in serum, colostrum and milk. The separation of immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk showed that high IgA levels are stimulated in the gammaglobulin fraction after immunization. After intake of colostrum and milk from sows, which were immunized orally and oronasally with fluid virus material in capsules, 90 % of the piglets (78 out of 87 animals) were protected against a challenge infection with 100\u2013500 LD(50). Most of the piglets showed diarrhea after challenge. Only in litters with fatal cases was a profuse diarrhea observed regularly. After oral capsule application of viral lyophilisate in powder form the protection rate was only 50 % (7 out of 14 piglets). Only one of ten piglets from a sow immunized parenterally with a commercially available vaccine for comparative reasons survived the challenge. The results are discussed with respect to the use of strain Bl as live vaccine in the control of TGE.

Suitable tools for live-cell imaging of enterovirus ROs are currently unavailable, as recombinant enteroviruses that carry genes that encode RO-anchored viral proteins tagged with fluorescent reporters have not been reported thus far. To overcome this limitation, we used a split green fluorescent protein (split-GFP) system, comprising a large fragment [strands 1 to 10; GFP(S1-10)] and a small fragment [strand 11; GFP(S11)] of only 16 residues. The GFP(S11) (GFP with S11 fragment) fragment was inserted into the 3A protein of the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), while the large fragment was supplied by transient or stable expression in cells. The introduction of GFP(S11) did not affect the known functions of 3A when expressed in isolation. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM), we showed that GFP fluorescence was detected at ROs, whose morphologies are essentially identical to those previously observed for wild-type CVB3, indicating that GFP(S11)-tagged 3A proteins assemble with GFP(S1-10) to form GFP for illumination of bona fide ROs. It is well established that enterovirus infection leads to Golgi disintegration. Through live-cell imaging of infected cells expressing an mCherry-tagged Golgi marker, we monitored RO development and revealed the dynamics of Golgi disassembly in real time. Having demonstrated the suitability of this virus for imaging ROs, we constructed a CVB3 encoding GFP(S1-10) and GFP(S11)-tagged 3A to bypass the need to express GFP(S1-10) prior to infection. These tools will have multiple applications in future studies on the origin, location, and function of enterovirus ROs. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses induce the formation of membranous structures (replication organelles [ROs]) with a unique protein and lipid composition specialized for genome replication. Electron microscopy has revealed the morphology of enterovirus ROs, and immunofluorescence studies have been conducted to investigate their origin and formation. Yet, immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells results in a rather static view of RO formation, and the results may be compromised by immunolabeling artifacts. While live-cell imaging of ROs would be preferred, enteroviruses encoding a membrane-anchored viral protein fused to a large fluorescent reporter have thus far not been described. Here, we tackled this constraint by introducing a small tag from a split-GFP system into an RO-resident enterovirus protein.

Previous investigations indicated that spectral interferences exist in the analysis of CsA blood samples by the above methods. In TOF\u2010SIMS, interference is caused by overlap of the Ag\u2010cationized internal standard, cyclosporin D (CsD), with the Ag\u2010cationized metabolite, AM1. To resolve this interference and obtain quantitative information, cross\u2010correlation analysis was applied to the TOF\u2010SIMS data. Application of damped non\u2010linear least squares curve\u2010fitting was carried out to resolve an interference in the MALDI/TOF\u2010MS data due to multiple cationization products (i.e. Na and K). Measurement of standard samples indicates that the minimum accuracy (95% confidence level) of the TOF\u2010SIMS method was better than 9% for CsA and 13% for AM1 using only one standard curve\u0027. Similarly, the minimum accuracy of the MALDI/TOF\u2010MS method was determined to be 14% for CsA and better than 25% for AM1. Blood samples obtained from transplant patients receiving CsA were analyzed by polyclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay, high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and by both TOF\u2010MS methods. Both TOF\u2010MS results for CsA and mono\u2010hydroxylated CsA are in good agreement with the HPLC results.","publish_time":"2005-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muddiman, David C.; Gusev, Arkady I.; Karl\u2010Stoppek\u2010Langner,; Proctor, Andrew; Hercules, David M.; Tata, Prasad; Venkataramanan, Raman; Diven, Warren","journal":"J Mass Spectrom","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9abd65018db9dd2970bcc6dd8542c68282864c6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CsA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TOF","hydroxylated CsA","AM1","analysis of CsA blood samples","MS results","MS methods","MALDI","SIMS data","SIMS method","standard curve","Measurement of standard samples","flight mass spectrometry","cationized internal standard","HPLC results","minimum accuracy","cationized metabolite","ion mass spectrometry","flight secondary","ionization time","correlation analysis","cyclosporin D","squares curve","major metabolite","Simultaneous quantification of cyclosporin","polyclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay","high\u2010performance liquid chromatography","mono","good agreement","multiple cationization products","quantitative information","CsD","matrix","Application of damped non\u2010linear","laser desorption","spectral interferences","transplant patients","confidence level","fitting","Previous investigations"],"language":"en"},

Fine mapping of T\u2010cell surface markers by flow cytometry offers a detailed status of the individual\u0027s inflammatory response. The frequency of MT2 (CD4(\u002B)CD45RA(\u2013)CD62L(\u002B)CD11adim) and MT1 (CD4(\u002B)CD45RA(\u2013)CD62L(\u2013)CD11abright) cells in peripheral blood, and their ratio, has been shown to differ predictably in atopics and patients with leprosy, where MT2 correlates with a Th2 phenotype and MT1 with a Th1 phenotype. Stable asthmatics, requiring fluticasone propionate (FP) 750\u20131000 \u00B5g daily or equivalent, were randomized to receive, double\u2010blinded, either Seretide(\u00AE)[salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (SFC, n = 16)] 50 \u00B5g/500 \u00B5g bd or FP 500 \u00B5g bd (n = 17). If asthma was controlled based on lung function and symptoms at clinic visits every 6 weeks, ICS dose was tapered until asthma exacerbated or 0 \u00B5g was reached. The frequency and ratio of MT2 and MT1 T cells of the patients was monitored at 6 week intervals. As treatment tapered, the frequency of MT2 cells decreased (P = 0038 from first to final visit), whereas that of MT1 cells increased. The ratio of MT2/MT1 decreased (P = 0049 from first to final visit). In patients receiving LABA \u002B ICS, the fall in MT2/MT1 ratio appeared to be more pronounced than in patients receiving ICS alone.

While the best\u2010studied, classically activated macrophage is induced by type I stimuli such as IFN\u2010\u03B3, a type II cytokine environment antagonizes the classical activation of macrophages and is capable of alternatively activating macrophages. However, molecular markers associated with these type II cytokine\u2010dependent, alternatively activated macrophages remain scarce. Besides the earlier documented markers macrophage mannose receptor and arginase 1, we recently demonstrated that murine alternatively activated macrophages are characterized by increased expression of FIZZ1 and Ym. We now report that expression of the two members of the mouse macrophage galactose\u2010type C\u2010type lectin gene family, termed mMGL1 and mMGL2, is induced in diverse populations of alternatively activated macrophages, including peritoneal macrophages elicited during infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei or the Helminth Taenia crassiceps, and alveolar macrophages elicited in a mouse model of allergic asthma. We also demonstrate that, in vitro, interleukin\u20104 and interleukin\u201013 upregulate mMGL1 and mMGL2 expression and that, in vivo, induction of mMGL1 and mMGL2 is dependent on interleukin\u20104 receptor signalling. Moreover, we show that regulation of MGL expression is similar in human monocytes and monocyte\u2010derived macrophages. Hence, macrophage galactose\u2010type C\u2010type lectins represent novel markers for both murine and human alternatively activated macrophages; thus, paving the way for further characterization of the phenotype of macrophages occurring in Th2 conditions.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Den Bergh, R.; Hassanzadeh, G.

We have previously shown that IL\u201012 alone can together with an unknown cofactor increase the expression of CLA. Stimulation with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SpeC) increased the expression of CD103 by CD8(\u002B) but not CD4(\u002B) T cells. While IL\u201012 increased superantigen\u2010stimulated expression of CLA, this cytokine strongly inhibited the CD103 expression, and a combination of IL\u201012 and TGF\u2010\u03B2 completely abrogated the induced CD103 expression. Conversely, IL\u201010 suppressed CLA but increased CD103 expression. These findings indicate that, in addition to suppressing the development of Th1\u2010mediated inflammatory responses, IL\u201010 may also inhibit the migration of CD8(\u002B) T cells into the skin while IL\u201012 promotes such migration. Thus, the expression of CLA and CD103 may be antagonistically regulated by IL\u201010 and IL\u201012, and the balance between these cytokines could influence the T\u2010cell migration of inflammatory cells into epithelial tissues.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sigmundsd\u00F3ttir, H.; Johnston, A.; Gudj\u00F3nsson, J.

We hypothesized that splenic CD11b(\u002B) MZM play an important role in the induction of autoimmunity, and we therefore analysed their cytokine profile after isolation with the help of magnetic antibody cell sorting. mRNA was isolated, and real\u2010time PCR was performed with specific primers for murine IFN\u2010\u03B3 (IFN\u2010\u03B3), interleukin\u201012 (IL\u201012) and IFN\u2010\u03B1 (IFN\u2010\u03B1).

Even though these 4(th) Industrial Revolution (4IR) phenomena are generally used interchangeably, this paper sought to identify how SMME readiness for smart manufacturing has been investigated through a systematic review. The systematic review was conducted through the lens of Nooteboom, and Tornatzky and Klein\u2019s research on technological innovation in SMMEs based on Rogers\u2019 diffusion of innovations theory. The findings reveal that there is little to no research on smart manufacturing in relation to SMMEs in low-income countries particularly the African continent. The results also show that smart manufacturing is still an emergent phenomenon with disparate definitional challenges. These definitional challenges make the adoption of smart manufacturing innovations a challenge in resource-constrained contexts; but similarly present an opportunity for new definitions and theories in such contexts. The little research often treats SMMEs homogenously and as such misses their important heterogeneous (sector or industry specific) nature. Few research studies investigate SMME awareness (adequate knowledge) or make explicit the benefits (relative advantage) of smart manufacturing. Even fewer studies are explicit on the smart manufacturing technologies that are relevant for different SMME sectors. Smart manufacturing is identified as incompatible with SMME characteristics, that is SMMEs lack expertise/skills to comprehend the complexity of smart manufacturing, and also lack financial and human resources to implement smart manufacturing. Given that awareness, relative advantage, complexity and compatibility are critical barriers for SMME smart manufacturing readiness/adoption, there is a critical need for research to focus on these factors in particular for the context of resource constrained low-income country environments.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gumbi, Lucas; Twinomurinzi, Hossana","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a91134e06fdff91e97d2eebd8827b694695c991.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134223.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klein"],"organizations":["Micro Businesses","SMME"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complexity of smart manufacturing","smart manufacturing technologies","SMME smart manufacturing readiness","adoption of smart manufacturing innovations","Smart Factory","SMME readiness","SMME awareness","research studies","little research","SMME characteristics","Klein\u2019s research","SMMEs lack expertise","different SMME sectors","relative advantage","phenomena","resource-constrained contexts","systematic review","disparate definitional challenges","critical barriers","context of resource","low-income countries","industry specific","critical need","fewer studies","low-income country environments","Rogers\u2019 diffusion of innovations theory","compatibility","technological innovation","Tornatzky","adequate knowledge","emergent phenomenon","relation","key necessity","benefits","skills","Micro Businesses","Industrial Revolution","opportunity","new definitions","theories","lens of Nooteboom","misses","human resources","African continent","nature","factors","paper","results","findings"],"language":"en"},

Despite ongoing conceptual, theoretical, and empirical debates, a large number of retrospective self-report scales have been produced to ostensibly measure various classes of such behaviour. These scales are typically based on a variety of theoretical and diagnostic frameworks. Given current conceptual ambiguities, building on previous studies, we evaluated the dimensional structure of 50 scales targeting the assessment of supposedly problematic behaviours in relation to four technologies: Internet, smartphones, video games, and social network sites. We find that two dimensions (\u2018compulsive use\u2019 and \u2018negative outcomes\u2019) account for over 50% of all scale-items analysed. With a median of five dimensions, on average, scales have considered fewer dimensions than various proposed diagnostic criteria and models. No relationships were found between the number of items in a scale and the number of dimensions, or the technology category and the dimensional structure. The findings indicate, firstly, that a majority of scales place an inordinate emphasis on some dimensions over others and, secondly, that despite differences in the items presented, at a dimensional level, there exists a high degree of similarity between scales. These findings highlight shortcomings in existing scales and underscore the need to develop more sophisticated conceptions and empirical tools to understand possible problematic interactions with various digital technologies.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abendroth, Adrian; Parry, Douglas A.; le Roux, Daniel B.; Gundlach, Jana","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134285.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of dimensions","existing scales","majority of scales","fewer dimensions","number of items","various classes","dimensional structure","scale-items","various digital technologies","large number of retrospective self-report scales","various forms of problematic media use","various proposed diagnostic criteria","problematic behaviours","dimensional level","findings","possible problematic interactions","empirical tools","empirical debates","diagnostic frameworks","compulsive use","variety of theoretical","current conceptual ambiguities","video games","smartphones","Internet","previous studies","assessment","average","sophisticated conceptions","social network sites","technology category","negative outcomes\u2019","need","high degree of similarity","models","inordinate emphasis","shortcomings","research attention","account","median","differences","relationships"],"language":"en"},

The first metaphor, social media as a town square, draws attention to the centrality of social media platforms in their users\u2019 lives, fear of missing out, augmented reality and digital dualism. Through the second metaphor, social media as a beauty pageant, we explore self-presentation or image crafting, social comparison and self-evaluation. The third metaphor, social media as a parliament, emphasises the role of social media platforms as spaces for online deliberation and we consider social media capital, homophily and polarisation as themes. Finally, we explore anonymity, deindividuation and deceptive self-presentation through our fourth metaphor, social media as a masquerade ball. We argue that social media scholars can use these and other metaphors to enhance communication of their research findings.

The immune system protects us from the majority of these pathogens as flatworms, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. We have also witnessed tremendous progress in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases; still, they remain a major challenge and are responsible for major cause of death and disability worldwide. The immune system\u2019s memory response and vaccination have resulted in complete eradication of many diseases. Our immune system is very adaptive and consists of a variety of cells and molecules, which play an active role in protecting us. It not only protects us from the outside pathogenic agents but also is also capable of recognizing the body\u2019s own components. It recognizes them as self and does not induce response against them. It is known as self-/non-self-discrimination. Sometimes due to certain defects or other reasons when the immune system is not able to differentiate self, then it mounts an attack on self-components leading to autoimmunity. The importance of the immune system was recognized by early work of Dr. Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur; they recognized the abilities of the immune system, and since then the system was gradually being explored and it laid the foundation of immunology. However, day-by-day microbes are also posing health risks as new strains are continuously being evolved. Many chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to control the spread and infections. However, microbes are also continuously developing the ability of their survival with emergence of new strains and properties. Antibiotic resistance is occurring with all classes of microbes posing a serious clinical problem in managing infections. The diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, and rheumatic fever, which were believed to be eradicated, have ferociously reemerged. The reemergence and new pathogenic agents might be the result of mutations in their genome and changes occurring in the environment. In this chapter, basic concept of the immune system and some of the diseases of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, and respiratory system caused by microorganisms are discussed along with sexually transmitted diseases and characterization of pathogens.","publish_time":"2016-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Varsha; Sengupta, Manjistha; Prakash, Jaya; Tripathy, Baishnab Charan","journal":"Basic and Applied Aspects of Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/629b5f05615348efca2ecf0d1cdde0f8c69f6de9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Edward Jenner"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nervous system","respiratory system","transmitted diseases","immune system\u2019s memory response","new pathogenic agents","self-components","treatment of infectious diseases","emergence of new strains","classes of microbes","characterization of pathogens","outside pathogenic agents","day-by-day microbes","chemotherapeutic agents","infections","non-self-discrimination","major challenge","major cause of death","vaccination","gastrointestinal tract","early work of","Edward Jenner","prevention","health risks","skin","serious clinical problem","Louis Pasteur","result of mutations","molecules","genome","bacteria","fungi","flatworms","tuberculosis","cholera","survival","attack","reasons","abilities","basic concept","majority","complete eradication","changes","rheumatic fever","tremendous progress","disability","inhalation","ingestion","chapter","autoimmunity","properties","microorganisms","reemergence","variety of cells","certain defects","active role","touch","environment","Antibiotic resistance","viruses","body\u2019s","importance","foundation of immunology","spread"],"language":"en"},

It is for this reason that so-called (specific pathogen free) SPF animals are used for animal experiments. Certain requirements are necessary to maintain the desired SPF organism. Physical barriers together with appropriate operating methods aim at preventing contamination with pathogens and penetration by wild rodents. As a consequence, barrier units are not easily accessible for personnel, which is sometimes considered a disadvantage by experimenters. Finally, monitoring programs help to detect and control potential sources of contamination and may therefore be of crucial importance for the management of a facility housing animals of a good microbiological quality. The main purpose of health monitoring is to detect or prevent infections, which might influence physiological characteristics of animals or their health. Appropriate health monitoring helps to avoid imprecise results and allows all the experiments necessary to be carried out with a minimum number of animal. It is found that sufficient number of animals have to be monitored to obtain relevant information on a given population.

It is estimated that the prevalence of wheezing during the first five years of life varies from 30\u201360%. In the majority of children who experience wheezing with respiratory infections, these episodes of wheezing become less frequent as the child grows older. However, determining whether the initial episode of wheezing with a viral respiratory illness is an important factor in the eventual development of asthma is an important question. Although a significant body of information suggests an association between respiratory tract illnesses in early life and the later development of airway dysfunction, this relationship is difficult to establish and indicates the complexity of factors that surround the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eventual expression of asthma. A similarly important issue to resolve is the relationship between respiratory infections and the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness. It is apparent that viral, not bacterial, upper respiratory infections (URIs) trigger asthma attacks. With the use of more sensitive techniques to identify respiratory viruses, the relationship between respiratory infections, particularly viral URIs, and asthma has become even more convincing and important.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busse, William W.; Dick, Elliot C.; Lemanske, Robert F.; Gern, James E.","journal":"Asthma","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155587/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["upper respiratory infections","respiratory viruses","viral respiratory illness","respiratory tract illnesses","eventual development of asthma","relationship","episodes of wheezing","prevalence of wheezing","viral URIs","important factor","important issue","important question","eventual expression of asthma","initial episode of wheezing","development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness","early life","trigger asthma attacks","later development of airway dysfunction","pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness","early childhood","years of life","association","resolve","sensitive techniques","significant body of information","complexity of factors","majority of children"],"language":"en"},

This chapter concentrates on the pathology of the more common pathogens of the laboratory rat. Based on serologic surveys, parvo viruses are some of the most common viral pathogens in wild and laboratory rat. In general, there are three main serogroups, including Rat virus (RV), H-1 virus, and Ratparvovirus (RPV). Both RPV and RV are tropic for many of the same tissues and they both may result in a persistent infection. However, RPV is antigenically and genetically distinct from RV, and it apparently does not cause clinical signs or lesions in infant rats. M. pulmonis causes natural disease in rats and mice. The infection in young rats is usually clinically silent. In older rats, there are nonspecific clinical signs such as snuffling, chromodacryorrhea, and face and ear rubbing. Several bacteria of the genus Streptococcus can cause clinical disease in rats. All of the streptococci of concern in rats are Gram-positive cocci, and are catalase-negative, nonfermentative, and generally nonmotile. Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus has been identified in rats. In rats, infection is usually asymptomatic although nonspecific clinical signs, such as weight loss and dyspnea, may be observed.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaillard, Elias T; Clifford, Charles B","journal":"The Laboratory Rat","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infant rats","young rats","older rats","clinical disease","laboratory rat","nonspecific clinical signs","Rat virus","RPV","common pathogens","common viral pathogens","natural disease","persistent infection","Gram-positive cocci","main serogroups","weight loss","genus Streptococcus","catalase-negative","chromodacryorrhea","lesions","parvo viruses","streptococci of concern","nonfermentative","serologic surveys","respiratory bacillus","pathology","Ratparvovirus","pulmonis","mice","face","ear","Cilia","dyspnea","bacteria","chapter","tissues"],"language":"en"},

The relationship between nanoparticles and the environment is clarified from the viewpoint of the kind of influence nanoparticles generated either artificially or naturally have on the environment, such as in atmosphere, groundwater, wastewaters, and exhaust gases. Indoor nanoparticles originate from the several sources such as products of chemical reactions, nonvolatile residues (NVRs) of liquid droplets, printers/photocopiers, combustion, bioaerosols, and infiltration of outdoor air. The influence of nanoparticles on the indoor environment is discussed in the chapter. It describes the sources of nanoparticle generation in general industrial processes such as grinding processes, and in cleanroom or controlled environment industrial processes, such as exhaled air, ionizers, and haze by chemical reaction on solid surfaces. The chapter discusses safety issues related to nanoparticles such as possibility of dust explosion, health risks and biological effects of nanoparticle materials such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, nanosized metal oxides, and carbon black. The chapter also discusses methods for removing nanoparticles from gas and liquid as technology to control the influence of nanoparticles on the environment.","publish_time":"2008-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makino, Hisao; Emi, Hitoshi; Yamaguchi, Akimasa; Iritani, Eiji; Namiki, Norikazu; Myojo, Toshihiko; Yamamoto, Kenji","journal":"Nanoparticle Technology Handbook","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influence of nanoparticles","Indoor nanoparticles","kind of influence nanoparticles","indoor environment","chapter","controlled environment industrial processes","general industrial processes","safety issues","relationship","sources of nanoparticle generation","carbon nanotubes","liquid droplets","carbon black","exhaled air","products of chemical reactions","infiltration of outdoor air","biological effects of nanoparticle materials","health risks","haze","NVRs","nanosized metal oxides","nonvolatile residues","possibility of dust explosion","bioaerosols","printers","fullerenes","combustion","photocopiers","ionizers","cleanroom","technology","groundwater","wastewaters","solid surfaces","viewpoint","exhaust gases","atmosphere","methods","trouble"],"language":"en"},

The Ang-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis is nowadays considered to be a main mechanism, which counterbalances the vasoconstrictive actions of classical RAS, which includes renin, ACE, ANG II, and its receptors AT(1) and AT(2). Whereas the classical RAS has been known for more than 100 years, the protective arm of the RAS was relatively recently discovered. Both Mas and Ang-(1-7) were first described almost 30 years ago; however, it took an additional 15 years until the interaction of these components was revealed.

The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing. Patient-reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID-19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID-19 patients has been performed. METHODS The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated 40-odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 60 age- and sex-matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction. A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the two groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex. RESULTS Fifty-nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction [mean (95% CI) UPSIT score: 20.98 (19.47,22.48); controls: 34.10 (33.31,34.88); p\u003C0.0001]. Thirty-five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and one normosmia (1/60; 2%). Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants. No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found. CONCLUSIONS Quantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID-19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.

Orf virus (ORFV) interferon resistance protein (VIR) is the principal virulence protein that encodes a dsRNA-binding protein to inhibit host antiviral response. p53 is one of the key proteins of the host antiviral innate immunity. It not only enhances type I interferon secretion but also induces apoptosis in infected cells, and plays a crucial role in the immune response against various viral infections. However, it remains to be elucidated what role p53 plays in ORFV replication and whether ORFV\u0027s own protein VIR regulates p53 expression to promote self-replication. In this study, we showed that p53 has an antiviral effect on ORFV and can inhibit ORFV replication. In addition, ORFV nonstructural protein VIR interacts with p53 and degrades p53, which inhibits p53-mediated positive regulation of downstream antiviral genes. This study provides new insight into the immune evasion mediated by ORFV and identifies VIR as an antagonistic factor for ORFV to evade the antiviral response.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Ming-Hao; Wang, Ling-Ling; Hao, Jun-Hong; Zhang, Xue-Gang; Shen, Chao-Chao; Zhang, Da-Jun; Zheng, Hai-Xue; Liu, Xiang-Tao; Zhang, Ke-Shan","journal":"Viral immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2019.0189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315577/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORFV","VIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORFV replication","role p53","ORFV nonstructural protein VIR","p53 expression","host antiviral response","antiviral effect","interferon resistance protein","immune response","dsRNA-binding protein","principal virulence protein","host antiviral innate immunity","self-replication","study","positive regulation of downstream antiviral genes","immune evasion","Orf virus","interferon secretion","crucial role","ovine contagious pustular dermatitis","ORFV\u0027s","key proteins","zoonotic disease","various viral infections","infected cells","serious threat","apoptosis","new insight","addition","antagonistic factor","sheep","humans","type"],"language":"en"},

Binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID-19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV- 2 spike protein form at day 7-10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It is also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.

METHODS We report on a family of three adults who experienced photophobia, intense eye pain, epiphora, blurred vision, and burning sensation over the face and neck area after a short period of unprotected exposure to UV germicidal lamps. RESULTS Initial examination revealed erythema and tenderness over the face and neck area, reduced visual acuity of 6/12, and conjunctival injections bilaterally in all three patients. Further assessment at the ophthalmology department three days later revealed gradual improvement of visual acuity to 6/6 bilaterally. Slit-lamp examinations revealed few punctate epithelial erosions. Fundal examinations were normal without evidence of solar retinopathy. The patients were diagnosed with germicidal-range UV irradiation-induced photokeratitis and epidermal phototoxicity. Lubricants and emollients were prescribed for symptom relief, and the patients were warned against using a UV germicidal lamp for disinfection purposes without appropriate protection.

Natural products have always played a crucial role in drug development process against various diseases which resulted in screening of such agents to combat emergent mutants of corona virus. This review focuses on those natural compounds that showed promising results against corona viruses. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered as a general mechanism for antiviral activity of most of the natural products, studies have shown that some natural products can interact with key viral proteins that are associated with virulence. In this context, some of the natural products have antiviral activity in the nanomolar concentration (e.g., lycorine, homoharringtonine, silvestrol, ouabain, tylophorine and 7-methoxycryptopleurine), and could be leads for further drug development on their own or as a template for drug design.

Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public\u0027s prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Nanning; Du, Shaoyi; Wang, Jianji; Zhang, He; Cui, Wenting; Kang, Zijian; Yang, Tao; Lou, Bin; Chi, Yuting; Long, Hong; Ma, Mei; Yuan, Qi; Zhang, Shupei; Zhang, Dong; Ye, Feng; Xin, Jingmin","journal":"IEEE transactions on cybernetics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2020.2990162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISI"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["ISI model","proposed hybrid AI model","epidemic data","traditional epidemic models","prediction results","COVID","prediction research","individuals","higher infection rate","infection rates","coronavirus disease","days","China","hybrid artificial-intelligence","actual transmission laws","effects of prevention","experimental results","development trend","public\u0027s prevention awareness","improved susceptible-infected","mean absolute percentage errors","module","natural language processing","NLP","increase","network","long short-term memory","cities","typical provinces","control measures","LSTM","MAPEs","line","Wuhan","Beijing","Shanghai","article","variety","countries","regions"],"language":"en"},

It is unknown if this negative influence relies on the increased risk of AR or the DGF itself. The different Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) values may also play a role in this interaction. METHODS Retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of DGF on graft function and graft survival in a subset of KT recipients (2004-2017). We also analyzed the relationship between KDPI and DGF. RESULTS The study includes601 KT,226of them (37%) developed DGF. Graft survival was lower in patients with DGF compared with non-DGF patients. Multivariable analysis revealed DGF as risk factor for graft loss, independently of the presence or not of acute rejection. Between DGF patients we observed poorer graft survival in patients with higher KDPI value (\u003E85%).We observed a trend of a greater impact of KDPI in patients with DGF, although this interaction was not statistically significant. Additionally, we observed poorer 12-month graft function in DGF patients. CONCLUSION DGF is related to poorer graft survival independently of the developed of acute rejection.

Women may experience vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, sexual dysfunction, vaginal symptoms and accelerated osteoporosis. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment to relieve these symptoms, its safety has been questioned for women with EOC. OBJECTIVES To assess the safety and efficacy of HRT for menopausal symptoms in women surgically treated for EOC. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 12 June 2019) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2019, week 23). We also handsearched conference reports and trial registries. There was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants of any age and menopausal status who had undergone surgery for EOC and, after diagnosis and treatment, used any regimen and duration of HRT compared with placebo or no hormone therapy. We also included trials comparing different regimens or duration of administration of HRT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently identified studies that met the inclusion criteria. They used Covidence to extract study characteristics, outcome data and to assess methodological quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS Our search strategy identified 2617 titles, of which 2614 titles were excluded. Three studies, involving 350 women, met our inclusion criteria. Two of the studies included pre and postmenopausal women, and the third only included premenopausal women. The overall age range of those women included in the studies was 20 to 89.6 years old, with a median follow-up ranging from 31.4 months to 19.1 years. The geographical distribution of participants included Europe, South Africa and China. All stages and histological subtypes were included in two of the studies, but stage IV disease had been excluded in the third. The three included studies used a variety of HRT regimens (conjugated oestrogen with or without medroxyprogesterone and with or without nylestriol) and HRT administrations (oral, patch and implant), In all studies, the comparisons were made versus women who had not received HRT. The studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and reporting bias, and at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias. The certainty of the evidence was low for overall survival and progression-free survival, and very low for quality-of-life assessment, incidence of breast cancer, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analysis of these studies showed that HRT may improve overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.93; 350 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). Quality-of-life assessment by use of the EORTC-C30 questionnaire was performed only in one study. We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces quality of life as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low (mean difference (MD) 13.67 points higher, 95% CI 9.26 higher to 18.08 higher; 1 study; 75 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Likewise, HRT may make little or no difference to progression-free survival (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.01; 275 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces the incidence of breast cancer (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 225 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence); TIA (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 102.42; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); CVA (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.88; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); and MI (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.10; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of gallstones was not reported in the included studies. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS Hormone replacement therapy may slightly improve overall survival in women who have undergone surgical treatment for EOC, but the certainty of the evidence is low. HRT may make little or no difference to quality of life, incidence of breast cancer, TIA, CVA and MI as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. There may be little or no effect of HRT use on progression-free survival. The evidence in this review is limited by imprecision and incompleteness of reported relevant outcomes and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed RCTs are required as this is an important area to women experiencing menopausal symptoms following surgical treatment for ovarian cancer, especially as doctors are often reluctant to prescribe HRT in this scenario. The evidence in this review is too limited to support or refute that HRT is very harmful in this population.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saeaib, Nungrutai; Peeyananjarassri, Krantarat; Liabsuetrakul, Tippawan; Buhachat, Rakchai; Myriokefalitaki, Eva","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012559.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EOC","HRT","Ovid","TIA","CVA"],"locations":["Europe","South Africa","China"],"keyphrases":["included studies","duration of HRT","low-certainty evidence","HRT administrations","efficacy of HRT","BACKGROUND Women","postmenopausal women","premenopausal women","variety of HRT regimens","menopausal symptoms","EOC","overall survival","quality of life","vaginal symptoms","vasomotor symptoms","progression-free survival","life assessment","methodological quality","SELECTION CRITERIA","inclusion criteria","geographical distribution of participants","randomized controlled trials","surgical treatment","menopausal status","surgery","points higher","effective treatment","overall age range","study characteristics","safety","hormone therapy","titles","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","epithelial ovarian cancer","unclear risk of selection","hormone replacement therapy","reporting bias","outcome data","mean difference","different regimens","attrition bias","DATA COLLECTION","duration of administration","search strategy","SEARCH METHODS","Meta-analysis","years old","incidence of breast cancer","high risk of performance","immediate loss of ovarian function","TIA","sexual dysfunction","difficulty","transient ischaemic attack","CVA","cerebrovascular accident","Europe","sleep disturbance","detection","use","conjugated oestrogen","review authors","MD","RCTs","hazard ratio","myocardial infarction","South Africa","accelerated osteoporosis","handsearched conference reports","trial registries","median follow-up","EORTC-C30 questionnaire","nylestriol","patch","implant","Issue","diagnosis","placebo","MAIN RESULTS","confidence interval","China","medroxyprogesterone","months","Covidence","chemotherapy","stages","histological subtypes","MEDLINE","OBJECTIVES","disease","comparisons","language restriction","Embase","week","RR","participants","study","effect of HRT use","ovarian cancer","women","MI","incidence of gallstones","review","risk ratio","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS Hormone replacement therapy","difference","relevant outcomes","imprecision","incompleteness","important area","doctors","results","support","Future well-designed RCTs","population","scenario","caution"],"language":"en"},

This scoping review aims to identify the preferred modalities for delivering CE to public health professionals and to determine how equity has been incorporated into public health training. METHODS Using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews as a guide, we searched four databases for peer-reviewed primary research studies that evaluated public health workforce CE modalities. RESULTS The review included 33 studies published between 1 January 2000 and 6 August 2019 from over 11 countries. Most articles broadly described their training audience as public health professionals employed by government or non-governmental organizations. Delivery methods included online, in-person or blended learning (combining online and in-person instruction). Learners strongly preferred self-directed approaches. Organizational support, including protected time for professional development during work hours, was an important enabler of training completion. Commonly cited barriers included course duration and a high number of contact hours. CONCLUSION Findings suggest that there is no single preferred training modality. We identified three elements that influence modality preference: design, delivery and organizational support. Modality should be determined by participants\u0027 location, needs and previous experiences to ensure the content is relevant and delivered in a way that equips learners to apply the knowledge gained.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Archer, Anya; Berry, Isha; Bajwa, Uttam; Kalda, Robyn; Di Ruggiero, Erica","journal":"Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.40.4.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA","CE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health training","public health professionals","public health workforce CE modalities","changing public health landscape","single preferred training modality","training audience","preferred modalities","Organizational support","modality preference","Delivery methods","Learners","knowledge","important enabler of training completion","work hours","Scoping Reviews","person instruction","primary research studies","high number of contact hours","protected time","design","course duration","professional development","previous experiences","PRISMA extension","databases","guide","peer","participants\u0027 location","non-governmental organizations","equity","cited barriers","INTRODUCTION Continuing education","content","elements","skills","blended learning","self-directed approaches","way","articles","CONCLUSION Findings","countries"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated factors associated with post-EP AP by a retrospective analysis of patients with tumors of the duodenal papilla who underwent EP from January 2008 to November 2016 at 2 tertiary care centers. Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic ultrasound parameters, and PPS placement were evaluated. Seventy-two patients underwent EP (37 men), with mean age of 60.3 (31-88) years. Mean main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter was 0.44 (0.18-1.8) cm. Mean tumor size was 1.8 (0.5-9.6) cm. Tumors were staged as uT1N0, uT2N0, and uT1N1 in 87.5%, 11.1%, and 1.4%. Thirty-eight AEs occurred in 33 (45.8%) patients, with no mortality. Total bilirubin, tumor size, MPD diameter, and PPS placement had odds ratios (ORs) of 0.82, 0.14, 0.00, and 6.43 for AP.

METHODS Between 2012 and 2017, among 385 patients who underwent 820 TA in our department, 65 (17%) patients (HCC = 11, LM = 54) had exclusive laparoscopic TA representing 112 lesions (HCC = 17, LM = 95). TA was associated with other procedures in 57% of cases (liver resection 81%). All TA were done without liver clamping. Median tumor size was 1.8 cm [ranges from 0.3 to 4.5], 18% of the lesions were larger than 3 cm in size and 11% close to major liver vessels. Tumors locations were 77.5% in right liver, 36% in S7\u0026S8, and 46% in S7\u0026S8\u0026S4a. RESULTS Mortality was nil and morbidity rate 15.4% including Dindo-Clavien \u003E II grade 3%. The median follow-up was 24 months [0.77-75]. Per lesion LR rate after TA was 18% (n = 19 patients) with a mean time of 7.6 months. Among patients with LR, 18 (95%) could have been re-treated successfully (new resection = 11, re-TA = 7). Multivariate analyses revealed that tumor location in S7 alone, S7\u0026S8 and/or S7, S8, or S4a were independent risk factors of LR after TA. CONCLUSIONS Exclusive laparoscopic TA is a safe and an effective tool to treat liver malignancies with or without liver resection. Other than classical risk factors, tumor location in upper segments of the liver, are independent risk factors for LR.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ledoux, Geoffrey; Amroun, Koceila; Rhaiem, Rami; Cagniet, Audrey; Aghaei, Arman; Bouche, Olivier; Hoeffel, Christine; Sommacale, Daniele; Piardi, Tullio; Kianmanesh, Reza","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07456-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32076859/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liver resection","re-TA","S7","liver malignancies","right liver","liver clamping","CONCLUSIONS Exclusive laparoscopic TA","S8","patients","independent risk factors of LR","major liver vessels","classical risk factors","lesion LR rate","tumor location","risk factors of local recurrence","new resection","Median tumor size","exclusive laparoscopic thermo-ablation","S4a","lesions","LM","HCC","months","morbidity rate","median follow-up","upper segments","effective tool","RESULTS Mortality","study","Dindo-Clavien","Multivariate analyses","mean time","cases","Tumors locations","BACKGROUND","aim","grade","ranges","procedures","department","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Hungary on 4 March 2020, and the first patient infected with a new type of coronavirus died on 15 March. At the time of the deceased\u0027s death, there was no central, uniform directive clarifying the range of precautions required or providing a clear description of the safe handling of the corpse. Transporting the dead to a pathology department, storing them, possibly dissecting them, and then placing them in their final resting place, how these raise countless questions. The current legislation on communicable diseases and actions on the dead does not provide sufficient information on the performance of tasks after the death of a COVID-19 infected patient. On March 19, the national chief medical officer suspended the autopsies, except for forensic autopsies, but transportation and storage remained a problem. Although on March 21, 2020, the Department of Pathology of the Health Professional College of the Ministry of Human Resources issued a formal procedure, the recommendations contained therein represent a narrower spectrum of literature and need to be supplemented in several places. Unfortunately, data on post-mortem procedures are also under-represented in the international literature, given their importance. Another problem is that in the articles written for the treatment of the victims of crisis situations caused by epidemics, the available algorithms take into account different organizational and resource possibilities in addition to the legal environment different from Hungary, which circumstances make domestic adaptation significantly more difficult. In our article, in addition to the literature review, we formulate suggestions and recommendations for healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed patients, as well as potentially affected pathology departments, which increase the safety of providers. * Orv Hetil. 2020; 161 (17): 713-722.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farkas, Csaba Bence; Petr\u00E9tei, D\u00E1vid; Babinszky, Gergely; Dud\u00E1s, G\u00E1bor; Szab\u00F3, Gerg\u0151; Bogn\u00E1r, Csaba; J\u00E4ckel, M\u00E1rta","journal":"Orvosi hetilap","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1556/650.2020.31818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324985/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Orv Hetil"],"organizations":["World Health Organization","the Ministry of Human Resources"],"locations":["China","Hungary"],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","Department of Pathology","addition","recommendations","international literature","literature review","dead","Hungary","confirmed case of COVID","infected patient","problem","narrower spectrum of literature","affected pathology departments","forensic autopsies","deceased\u0027s death","confirmed patients","account different organizational","legal environment different","Health Professional College","World Health Organization","beta-coronavirus outbreak","new type of coronavirus","resource possibilities","circumstances","Ministry of Human Resources","available algorithms","epidemics","communicable diseases","actions","suggestions","range of precautions","formal procedure","performance of tasks","healthcare professionals","victims of crisis situations","national chief medical officer","safe handling","raise countless questions","final resting place","clear description","uniform directive","post-mortem procedures","current legislation","pandemic","domestic adaptation","sufficient information","transportation","storage","Wuhan","data","SARS-CoV","China","corpse","safety of providers","time","importance","articles","Orv Hetil","places"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report about our local experience in a region with high COVID-19 prevalence and dynamically increasing infection rates. Methods: Within the 8 day period of March 16-24, 2020, hybrid imaging studies of asymptomatic patients who underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT or 131I-SPECT/CT for standard oncologic indications at our institution in Brescia, Italy, were analyzed for findings suggestive of COVID-19. Presence, radiological features and metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia were identified, correlated with subsequent short-term clinical course and described in a case series. Results: Six of 65 patients (9%) that underwent PET/CT for various malignancies showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional FDG-avidity. Additionally, 1 of 12 patients who received radioiodine for differentiated thyroid carcinoma also showed interstitial pneumonia on SPECT/CT. 5/7 patients had subsequent proof of COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The remaining 2 patients were not tested immediately but underwent quarantine and careful monitoring. Conclusion: Incidental findings suggestive of COVID-19 may not be infrequent in hybrid imaging of asymptomatic patients, in regions with expansive spread of SARS-CoV-2. Nuclear medicine services should prepare accordingly.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albano, Domenico; Bertagna, Francesco; Bertolia, Mattia; Bosio, Giovanni; Lucchini, Silvia; Motta, Federica; Panarotto, Maria Beatrice; Peli, Alessia; Camoni, Luca; Bengel, Frank M; Giubbini, Raffaele","journal":"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.246256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238429/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hybrid imaging of asymptomatic patients","high COVID","hybrid imaging studies of asymptomatic patients","Incidental findings suggestive of COVID","subsequent proof of COVID","unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia","metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia","nuclear imaging procedures","SPECT","standard clinical indications","PET","standard oncologic indications","F-FDG","subsequent short-term clinical course","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","expansive spread of SARS","increasing infection rates","Nuclear medicine services","elevated regional FDG-avidity","various malignancies","prevalence","regions","radiological features","institution","thyroid carcinoma","under-recognition","Presence","Brescia","related disease","Italy","Conclusion","local experience","radioiodine","case series","RT-PCR","quarantine","careful monitoring","Methods","day period","Results"],"language":"en"},

This paper aimed to compare the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 responses of adult patients with mental disorders to their family caregivers. METHODS In this study, 205 pairs of patients with mental disorders and primary family caregivers were consecutively recruited from one inpatient mental health department in a large hospital in China. All participants completed the 12-item version WHODAS 2.0 to assess patients\u0027 functioning in the 30 days prior to the hospitalization. Measurement invariance, including configural, metric and scalar invariance, was tested across patient and proxy groups, using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. Agreement between patients and proxies was examined by paired Wilcoxon tests and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Subgroup analyses for proxy reliability were conducted within strata of proxy kinship and patient psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS The 12-item WHODAS 2.0 achieved configural, metric and partial scalar invariance across patient and proxy groups. Unsatisfactory consistency was found for most items (ICC \u003C 0.75, P \u003C 0.05), especially for items on Cognition, Getting along, Life activities, and Participation in society (ICC \u003C 0.4, P \u003C 0.05). Spouses agreed with patients more often than parents (ICC \u2265 0.4, P \u003C 0.05). The paired Wilcoxon tests found that impairment of patients with psychotic disorders tended to be overestimated by proxies while proxies tended to underestimate impairment of patients with mood disorders. CONCLUSION Our study reveals inconsistency between self and proxy reports in the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 among adult patients with mental disorders. When proxy reports is needed, spouses are preferred than parents. We should be aware of proxies\u0027 impairment overestimation among patients with psychotic disorders and underestimation among patients with mood disorders.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Wei; Liu, Qian; Yu, Yu; Xiao, Shuiyuan; Chen, Lizhang; Khoshnood, Kaveh; Zheng, Shimin","journal":"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02474-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["mental disorders","impairment of patients","pairs of patients","psychotic disorders","mood disorders","proxy reliability","proxy groups","proxy reports","item WHODAS","responses of adult patients","ICC","item version WHODAS","strata of proxy kinship","inpatient mental health department","metric","partial scalar invariance","paired Wilcoxon tests","Measurement invariance","study","items","parents","Spouses","patient psychiatric diagnosis","primary family caregivers","achieved configural","aware of proxies\u0027 impairment overestimation","wide usage of World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule","intraclass correlation coefficients","multi-group confirmatory factor analysis","underestimation","large hospital","limited knowledge","clinical practice","society","inconsistency","self","people","patients\u0027 functioning","Life activities","Participation","psychiatry research","days","China","PURPOSE","Cognition","CONCLUSION","Subgroup analyses","Unsatisfactory consistency","METHODS","participants","Agreement","hospitalization","paper"],"language":"en"},

Denitrification is a critical process for transferring soil N to the atmosphere. Denitrifying bacterial communities in soil are indicative of the soil quality of a functional ecosystem. We investigated the effects of physicochemical properties of soil on the diversity and activity of denitrifiers in the top-soil and sub-soil of two typical montane riparian meadows: a multi-colored and a flood-plain meadow. Illumina MiSeq 2500 sequencing of nirS showed that the multi-colored meadow had greater diversity and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers than the flood-plain meadow and that the total N content, ammonium content, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in soil differed significantly between the two types of meadows. The abundances of dominant denitrifiers at phylum and genus levels showed different responses to the two soil layers of the two meadow types. In top-soils, the highest abundance of Firmicutes was recorded in the multi-colored meadow, while in the flood-plain meadow, there was the highest abundance of Proteobacteria. The Actinobacteria abundance was the highest in top-soil and sub-soil of the flood-plain meadow. The abundance of Chloroflexi was the highest in top-soil of the flood-plain meadow and in sub-soil of the multi-colored meadow. The diversity of denitrifying bacteria was strongly influenced by variations of soil properties down the soil profile. Spearman\u0027s rank correlation analyses showed that the diversity and community composition of denitrifying bacteria were strongly associated with most of the soil properties. Therefore, physicochemical soil properties, and particularly the organic carbon, nitrate, and ammonium contents, influence the diversity and abundance of denitrifiers in soil.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xiaoli; Huang, Chunguo; Khan, Shahbaz; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chen, Yinglong; Guo, Jinping","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09171-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sub-soil","soil N","soil quality","soil layers","soil profile","physicochemical soil properties","variations of soil properties","multi-colored meadow","flood-plain meadow","effects of physicochemical properties of soil","meadow types","abundance of denitrifiers","abundance of nirS","highest abundance of Firmicutes","highest abundance of Proteobacteria","Actinobacteria abundance","abundance of Chloroflexi","diversity of denitrifying bacteria","greater diversity","activity of denitrifiers","type denitrifiers","abundances of dominant denitrifiers","types of meadows","community composition of denitrifying bacteria","total N content","denitrification enzyme activity","ammonium contents","sequencing of nirS","typical montane riparian meadows","Mountain riparian zones","aquatic ecosystems","phylum","nitrogen deposition processes","nutrient runoff","excellent buffers","genus levels","different responses","organic carbon","fertilization","nitrate","Spearman\u0027s rank correlation analyses","critical process","DEA","manure","Illumina MiSeq","bacterial communities","functional ecosystem","soils","atmosphere"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the impact of such a training was investigated for rehearsal of patient-specific cases as well as for a structured simulation curriculum to teach angiographer novices. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 40 patients undergoing a diagnostic neuroangiography were randomized in a training and control group. In all training group patients, the angiographer received a patient-anatomy-specific rehearsal on a high-fidelity simulator prior to the real angiography. Radiation exposure, total duration, fluoroscopy time and amount of contrast agent of the real angiography were recorded. Silent cerebral ischemia was counted by magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Additionally, the first 30 diagnostic neuroangiographies of six novices were compared (ntotal = 180). Three novices had undergone a structured simulation curriculum; three had acquired angiographic skills without simulation. RESULTS No differences were found in the number of DWI lesions or in other quality measures of the angiographies performed with and without patient-specific rehearsal. A structured simulation curriculum for angiographer novices reduced fluoroscopy time significantly and radiation exposure. The curriculum had no influence on the total duration of the examination, the amount of contrast medium or the number of catheters used. CONCLUSION There was no measurable benefit of patient-anatomy-specific rehearsal for an unselected patient cohort. A structured simulation-based curriculum to teach angiographic skills resulted in a reduction of fluoroscopy time and radiation dose in the first real angiographies of novice angiographers.

Currently, no standard exists for optimal timing or a pharmacological agent for VTE prophylaxis (pharmacological thromboprophylaxis - PTP) in patients with TBI. PTP is often delayed out of fear of causing extension of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The purpose of this study was to report the frequency of VTE and ICH progression after initiation of PTP with a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin in patients with moderate to severe TBI, and to identify risk factors associated with development of VTE. METHODS In this single-center retrospective study, patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted to the ICU of a Swiss Level I Trauma Center over a three-year period were analyzed. RESULTS In 23 (13%) of the 177 patients included in the study a VTE episode occurred during the hospital stay. ICH progression after initiation of PTP occurred in 7 (4%) patients. In a multivariable logistic regression model, only the timing of initiation of PTP was identified as an independent predictor of VTE. CONCLUSIONS In this study population, the risk of developing VTE increased with the delay of initiation of a pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, while ICH progression after initiation of PTP was a rare event.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brandi, Giovanna; Schmidlin, Adrian; Klinzing, Stephanie; Sch\u00FCpbach, Reto; Unseld, Simone; Pagnamenta, Alberto","journal":"Anaesthesiology intensive therapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5114/ait.2020.93395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191827/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBI","PTP","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","initiation of PTP","frequency of VTE","development of VTE","VTE episode","pharmacological VTE prophylaxis","risk of developing VTE","timing of initiation","ICH progression","pharmacological thromboprophylaxis - PTP","independent predictor of VTE","delay of initiation","severe TBI","study population","pharmacological agent","single-center retrospective study","Trauma Center","optimal timing","risk factors","increased morbidity","recognized complication","continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin","traumatic brain injury","ICU","Swiss Level","multivariable logistic regression model","extension of intracranial hemorrhage","fear","three-year period","BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism","METHODS","rare event","mortality","standard","CONCLUSIONS","hospital","purpose","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use. Objective To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation). Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included. Exposures History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing. Main Outcomes and Measures Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive. Results A total of 18 472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12 725 (69%) were white. Of 18 472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18 472 patients (9.4%). Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15). Conclusions and Relevance This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity. These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, Neil; Kalra, Ankur; Nowacki, Amy S; Anjewierden, Scott; Han, Zheyi; Bhat, Pavan; Carmona-Rubio, Andres E; Jacob, Miriam; Procop, Gary W; Harrington, Susan; Milinovich, Alex; Svensson, Lars G; Jehi, Lara; Young, James B; Chung, Mina K","journal":"JAMA cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARB","Cleveland Clinic Health System"],"locations":["Florida"],"keyphrases":["positive COVID","time of COVID","clinical measures of COVID","Measures Results of COVID","severity of clinical outcomes of COVID","ARBs","use of ACEIs","number of patients","subsets of patients","ARB use","likelihood of testing positive","significant association of ACEI","setting","mechanical ventilation","overlap propensity score weighting","larger numbers of hospitalized patients","study outcome data","intensive care unit admissions","ARB therapy","test positivity","continued use","Participants Retrospective cohort study","absence of clinical evidence","test result","pandemic","propensity score-weighted odds ratio","clinical data support current professional society guidelines","professional societies","entire cohort","role of angiotensin","Main Outcomes","coronavirus disease","chronic disease conditions","hospitalizations","requirement","Cleveland Clinic Health System","Ohio","enzyme inhibitors","receptor blockers","Florida","treatment","age","Design","Relevance","Exposures History","medications","mean","SD","Importance","Conclusions","Objective","total","recommendations","years","male"],"language":"en"},

The prioritisation of high value cancer interventions must be embedded in the agenda for the pandemic response, ensuring that no inconsistency or discrepancy emerge in the health planning processes.The aim of this work is to organise health interventions for breast cancer management and research in a tiered framework (high, medium, low value), formulating a scheme of prioritisation per clinical cogency and intrinsic value or magnitude of benefit. The public health tools and schemes for priority setting in oncology have been used as models, aspiring to capture clinical urgency, value in healthcare, community goals and fairness, while respecting the principles of benevolence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice.We discuss the priority health interventions across the cancer continuum, giving a perspective on the role and meaning to maintain some services (undeferrable) while temporarily abrogate some others (deferrable). Considerations for implementation and the essential link to pre-existing health services, especially primary healthcare, are addressed, outlining a framework for the development of effective and functional services, such as telemedicine.The discussion covers the theme of health systems strategising, and why oncology care, in particular breast cancer care, should be maintained in parallel to pandemic control measures, providing a pragmatic clinical model within the broader context of public healthcare schemes.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Azambuja, Evandro; Trapani, Dario; Loibl, Sibylle; Delaloge, Suzette; Senkus, Elzbieta; Criscitiello, Carmen; Poortman, Philip; Gnant, Michael; Di Cosimo, Serena; Cortes, Javier; Cardoso, Fatima; Paluch-Shimon, Shani; Curigliano, Giuseppe","journal":"ESMO open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health services prioritisation","pre-existing health services","priority health interventions","public health tools","prioritisation of high value cancer interventions","health planning processes","theme of health systems","intrinsic value","particular breast cancer care","cancer continuum","low value","oncology care","functional services","pandemic response","breast cancer management","clinical cogency","clinical urgency","scheme of prioritisation","primary healthcare","pandemic proportion","broader context of public healthcare schemes","pragmatic clinical model","pandemic control measures","highest quality standards of care","tiered framework","rapid escalation","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","research","evidence-based mechanism","SARS-CoV","essential link","non-maleficence","justice","community goals","principles of benevolence","autonomy","implementation","formulation","fairness","telemedicine","aim","discussion","discrepancy","magnitude of benefit","development of effective","inconsistency","global preparedness","related disease","Considerations","COVID","patients","perspective","models","agenda","role"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS Intellectual and/or Developmental disabilities were the most studied population (76% of articles), and most articles were published in the United States (57%). Twenty-two bridging tasks were identified, and categorized into three domains: health and social service delivery (e.g., care coordination tasks), policy (e.g., policy change), and research and training (e.g., mentoring).

Pleural effusions continue to be a complication that affect many surgical patients and are associated with increased morbidity, many times requiring readmission and additional invasive procedures. The risks for development of pleural effusion after hospital discharge are ill-defined, which leads to uncertainty related to strategies for prevention. Our primary objective was to determine, in patients with CHD requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, the prevalence of post-surgical pleural effusions leading to readmission. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with post-surgical pleural effusions requiring readmission. We identified 4417 citations; 10 full-text articles were included in the final review. Of the included studies, eight focused on single-ventricle palliation, one looked at Tetralogy of Fallot patients, and another on pleural effusion in the setting of post-pericardiotomy syndrome. Using a random-effect model, the overall prevalence of pleural effusion requiring readmission was 10.2% (95% CI 4.6; 17.6). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 91%). In a subpopulation of patients after single-ventricle palliation, the prevalence was 13.0% (95% CI 6.0;21.0), whereas it was 3.0% (95% CI 0.4;6.75) in patients mostly with biventricular physiology.

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwee, R M; Krdzalic, J; Fasen, B A C M; de Jaegere, T M H","journal":"AJNR.

ProGrip\u2122 is a self-gripping mesh which aims to reduce rates of chronic pain. The aim of this study is to perform an update meta-analysis to consolidate the non-superiority hypothesis in terms of postoperative pain and recurrence and perform a trial sequential analysis. METHODS Systematic review of randomised controlled trials performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) method. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pain and secondary outcomes were recurrence, operative time, wound complications, length of stay, re-operation rate, and cost. Trial sequential analysis was performed. RESULTS There were 14 studies included in the quantitative analysis with 3180 patients randomised to self-gripping mesh (1585) or standard mesh (1595). At all follow-up time points, there was no significant difference in the rates of chronic pain between the self-gripping and standard mesh (risk ratio, RR 1.10, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.83-1.46). There were no significant differences in recurrence rates (RR 1.13, CI 0.84-2.04). The mean operating time was significantly shorted in the ProGrip\u2122 mesh group (MD - 7.32 min, CI - 10.21 to - 4.44). Trial sequential analysis suggests findings are conclusive. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis has confirmed no benefit of a ProGrip\u2122 mesh when compared to a standard sutured mesh for open inguinal hernia repair in terms of chronic pain or recurrence. No further trials are required to address this clinical question.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bullen, N L; Hajibandeh, S; Hajibandeh, S; Smart, N J; Antoniou, S A","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07658-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["standard mesh","rates of chronic pain","self-gripping mesh","terms of chronic pain","mesh group","trial sequential analysis","CI","standard sutured mesh","recurrence rates","quantitative analysis","terms of postoperative pain","update meta-analysis","ProGrip","open inguinal hernia repair","operative time","follow-up time points","mean operating time","confidence intervals","significant differences","METHODS Systematic review of randomised controlled trials","secondary outcomes","length of stay","risk ratio","non-superiority hypothesis","wound complications","re-operation rate","primary outcome measure","INTRODUCTION Morbidity","patients","findings","MD","benefit","Pooled odds ratios","PRISMA guidelines","cost","Mantel-Haenszel","study","studies","CONCLUSION","clinical question","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the snapshot microplastic profile of an urban stream was assessed in the Braamfontein Spruit, located in Johannesburg the largest city in South Africa. The abundance of microplastics was determined in water, Chironomus sp. larvae and sediment, while in situ parameters were taken to investigate their relationship to the microplastic profile of the different matrices. Microplastics were detected in water (mean of 705 particles m-3), Chironomus sp. larvae (mean of 53.4 particles g-1 wet weight) and sediment (mean of 166.8 particles kg-1 dry weight). The study found evidence of how urban stream characteristics such as a weir, stream depth and velocity could affect the abundance and dispersion of microplastics. The results indicate that areas of increased depth and decreased flow allowed microplastics to settle down to the sediment where benthic macroinvertebrates could ingest these fragments. Large obstructions like a weir also increased microplastic counts in sediment and invertebrates above the obstruction, with a decrease of fragments after the obstruction, however, microplastics in surface water were able to flow over the obstruction and increase in abundance downstream. This study concludes that first order urban streams such as the Braamfontein Spruit may be contributing large numbers of microplastics to higher order streams and large rivers in times of increased flow.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dahms, Heinrich T J; van Rensburg, Gregg J; Greenfield, Richard","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Johannesburg","South Africa"],"keyphrases":["abundance of microplastics","dispersion of microplastics","large numbers of microplastics","sediment","study","stream depth","order urban streams","urban stream characteristics","times of increased flow","large rivers","weir","Large obstructions","Braamfontein Spruit","snapshot microplastic profile","areas of increased depth","decreased flow","larvae","surface water","particles g","Chironomus","decrease of fragments","higher order streams","small plastic fragments","South Africa","wet weight","dry weight","Johannesburg","velocity","largest city","freshwater systems","research","evidence","situ parameters","relationship","different matrices","results","benthic macroinvertebrates","world"],"language":"en"},

The incidence of enteric infections caused by these eight pathogens reported by FoodNet sites in 2019 continued to increase or remained unchanged, indicating progress in controlling major foodborne pathogens in the United States has stalled. Campylobacter and Salmonella caused the largest proportion of illnesses; trends in incidence varied by Salmonella serotype. Widespread adoption of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacteria has improved the ability to identify outbreaks, emerging strains, and sources of pathogens. To maximize the potential of WGS to link illnesses to particular sources, testing of isolates by clinical and public health laboratories is needed. Reductions in Salmonella serotype Typhimurium suggest that targeted interventions (e.g., vaccinating chickens and other food animals) might decrease human infections.

OBJECTIVE We will describe the medical activities and the difficulties of the cruise ship quarantine. METHODS Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed on all 3,711 persons (2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew). RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-six (18.8%) reported positive, of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patient with RT-PCR-positive had lung opacities when they have a chest CT (Computed tomography). There were many difficulties onboard, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and non-infectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, thirty-one patients (4.5% of RT-PCR test positives) were hospitalized requiring ventilator support or intensive care, and seven patients (1.0% of RT-PCR test positives) died.

All age groups can be infected from the virus, but more serious symptoms that can possibly result in death are observed in older people and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Novel data report more severe symptoms and even a negative prognosis for the obese patients. A growing body of evidence connects obesity with COVID\u201119 and a number of mechanisms from immune system activity attenuation to chronic inflammation are implicated. Lipid peroxidation creates reactive lipid aldehydes which in a patient with metabolic disorder and COVID\u201119 will affect its prognosis. Finally, pregnancy\u2011associated obesity needs to be studied further in connection to COVID\u201119 as this infection could pose high risk both to pregnant women and the fetus.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrakis, Demetrios; Margin\u0103, Denisa; Tsarouhas, Konstantinos; Tekos, Fotios; Stan, Miriana; Nikitovic, Dragana; Kouretas, Demetrios; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Tsatsakis, Aristidis","journal":"Molecular medicine reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2020.11127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global spread of COVID","severe symptoms","older people","group of viruses","Lipid peroxidation","serious symptoms","negative prognosis","associated obesity","virus responsible","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","reactive lipid aldehydes","human respiratory tract","enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses","immune system activity attenuation","underlying medical conditions","chronic inflammation","SARS","number of mechanisms","infections","pregnant women","high risk","CoVs","Novel data report","growing body of evidence","pulmonary disease","metabolic disorder","humanity","Coronaviruses","obese patients","death","worst pandemic","century","fetus","pregnancy","age groups","date","connection"],"language":"en"},

Evidence indicates that HIV-seropositive women are 2 to 12 times more likely to develop precancerous lesions that lead to cervical cancer than HIV-negative women. There is a lack of rigorous evidence on which treatment methods are being utilised for HIV-positive women, and this review aims to synthesise available evidence on treatment modalities for both cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer in HIV-seropositive women in developing countries. METHODS A systematic review guided by a published protocol was conducted. Online databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Emerald (via EBSCOhost), PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and health databases, which cover developing countries (3ie Systematic Reviews, WHO library and databases, World Bank website), were searched for published articles. Additional articles were found through citation, reference list tracking, and grey literature. Study design, treatment category, geographic country/region, and key outcomes for each included article were documented and summarised. RESULTS Thirteen research articles from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America were included. Eight (61.5%) articles focused on the treatment of cervical cancer with the remaining five (38.5%) assessed cervical neoplasia treatment. The available cervical cancer treatments, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and surgery are effective for HIV-seropositive patients, and these are the same treatments for HIV-negative patients. Both cryotherapy and LEEP are effective in reducing CIN2\u002B among HIV-seropositive women, and a choice between the treatments might be based on available resources and expertise. Radiation, chemotherapy, concurrent treatment using radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and surgery have shown the possibility of effectiveness among HIV-seropositive women. Cervical cancer stage, immunosuppressive level including those on HAART, and multisystem toxicities due to treatment are associated with treatment completion, prognostic, and survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of cervical cancer is based on the stage of cancer, and poor outcomes in most developing countries might be due to a lack of optimal treatment regimen. Those infected with HIV were younger and had advanced cervical cancer as compared to those who were HIV-negative. Facilitation and putting HIV-infected people on life-long ART is of importance and has been found to have a positive impact on cervical cancer treatment response. Research on precancerous lesions and cervical cancer management of HIV-seropositive patients focusing on the quality of life of those treated; the effectiveness of the treatment method considering CD4\u002B count and ART is required.

From a forensic point of view, this event is partly changing the manner in which forensic pathologists and all those who work in autopsy services operate, but above all, it is changing the patterns established for years by which cadavers were analysed postmortem. Objective: To present a review of the literature and a proposal for COVID autopsy protocols. To contain the infection risk, a revision of all the protocols that until now have been applied to the examination of bodies that require autopsy services is required. Data source: Currently, the diagnosis and postmortem analysis of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases plays a crucial role in scientific research. A review of the main recommendations proposed by international scientific societies regarding the risk of infection during autopsy has been carried out. Scientific papers currently available via the PubMed NCBI search engine on COVID-19 postmortem diagnosis were also examined. Discussion: Throughout the history of medicine, the role of autopsy has been fundamental to the understanding of multiple pathogenic processes that are investigated postmortem through autopsy. The purpose of the study is to propose an operating protocol that can be useful for all clinical and forensic autopsies with particular reference to the correct methods to be applied to the examination of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases regarding both the autopsy procedure and the collection and analysis of biological samples.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aquila, Isabella; Sacco, Matteo Antonio; Abenavoli, Ludovico; Malara, Natalia; Arena, Vincenzo; Grassi, Simone; Ausania, Francesco; Boccuto, Luigi; Ricci, Cristoforo; Gratteri, Santo; Oliva, Antonio; Ricci, Pietrantonio","journal":"Archives of pathology \u0026 laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0165-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32383963/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID autopsy protocols","role of autopsy","autopsy services","autopsy procedure","suspected COVID","postmortem diagnosis","postmortem analysis of positive","analysed postmortem","cases","Scientific papers","examination of positive","forensic autopsies","scientific research","infection risk","risk of infection","forensic pathologists","review","international scientific societies","forensic point of view","crucial role","examination of bodies","analysis of biological samples","PubMed NCBI search engine","particular reference","main recommendations","understanding of multiple pathogenic processes","collection","proposal","branches","correct methods","event","years","cadavers","novel coronavirus disease","literature","methodological approaches","history of medicine","study","operating protocol","Context","manner","pandemic","revision","health system","Discussion","patterns","Data source","purpose","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Further exploration is required to distinguish the concept\u0027s unique meanings and significance from the perspective of implementation science. The study clarifies the concept of rapid implementation and identifies its attributes, antecedents, and consequences. We present a theoretical definition of rapid implementation to clarify its unique meaning and characteristics. METHODS Rodgers evolutionary concept analysis method, combined with a systematic integrative review, were used to clarify the concept of rapid implementation. A comprehensive search of four databases, including EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and WEB OF SCIENCE was conducted, as well as relevant journals and reference lists of retrieved studies. After searching databases, 2442 papers were identified from 1963 to 2019; 24 articles were found to fit the inclusion criteria to capture data on rapid implementation from across healthcare settings in four countries. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive thematic analysis. RESULTS The results locate the introduction of rapid implementation, informed by implementation science. Guidance for further conceptualisation to bridge the gap between research and practice and redefine rigour, adapting methods used (current approaches, procedures and frameworks), and challenging clinical trial design (efficacy-effectiveness-implementation pipeline) is provided. CONCLUSIONS It is possible that we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift within implementation brought about by the need for faster results into practice and policy. Researchers can benefit from a deeper understanding of the rapid implementation concept to guide future implementation of rapid actionable results in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, James; Rapport, Frances; O\u0027Brien, Tracey A; Smith, Stephanie; Tyrrell, Vanessa J; Mould, Emily V A; Long, Janet C; Gul, Hossai; Cullis, Jeremy; Braithwaite, Jeffrey","journal":"BMC health services research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05289-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rodgers"],"organizations":["WEB OF SCIENCE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concept of rapid implementation","rapid implementation concept","introduction of rapid implementation","implementation pipeline","theoretical definition of rapid implementation","perspective of implementation science","future implementation of rapid actionable results","clinical practice","Data analysis","faster results","METHODS Rodgers evolutionary concept analysis method","WEB OF SCIENCE","databases","descriptive thematic analysis","precise definition","concept\u0027s unique meanings","challenging clinical trial design","efficacy-effectiveness","frameworks","significance","procedures","reference lists of retrieved studies","deeper understanding","relevant journals","current approaches","healthcare settings","EMBASE","MEDLINE","SCOPUS","rigour","cusp","inclusion criteria","attributes","need","conceptualisation","systematic integrative review","gap","antecedents","paradigm shift","policy","literature","BACKGROUND","study","comprehensive search","consequences","countries","Researchers","characteristics","CONCLUSIONS","Guidance","exploration","articles","papers"],"language":"en"},

Advanced stage patients of EC have poor prognosis. Inevitable side effects and treatment tolerance of chemotherapy for EC remain to be addressed. Our results in this study showed that EC cells with higher tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) expression have lower sensitivity to poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors. Upon TRAF4 knockdown, the colony numbers of EC cells were markedly down-regulated, and the markers of DNA double-strand breakage were significantly up-regulated after the treatment of olaparib, a PARP1 inhibitor. TRAF4 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), promoted DNA double-strand breakage, and decreased levels of DNA repair related proteins, including phosphorylated-DNA-dependent protein kinase (p-DNA-PK) and RAD51 recombinase (RAD51). In addition, TRAF4\u0027s effect on the sensitivity of EC cells to olaparib was further found to be mainly mediated by Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, in vivo results showed that TRAF4 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of EC to PARP1 inhibitors using a mouse xenograft model. Collectively, our data suggest that combined application of TRAF4 knockdown and PARP1 inhibition can be used as a promising strategy for synthetic lethality in EC treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Liulin; Wang, Min; Jiang, Li; Zeng, Chengying","journal":"Human cell","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13577-020-00363-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388810/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EC treatment","sensitivity of EC cells","colony numbers of EC cells","phosphorylated-DNA","p-DNA","PARP1 inhibitors","combined application of TRAF4 knockdown","Advanced stage patients of EC","PARP1 inhibition","treatment of olaparib","markers of DNA double-strand breakage","lower sensitivity","Akt phosphorylation","results","phosphorylation of protein kinase B","decreased levels of DNA repair related proteins","dependent protein kinase","treatment tolerance of chemotherapy","RAD51 recombinase","higher tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor","expression","poly ADP-ribose polymerase","PK","s effect","promising strategy","synthetic lethality","poor prognosis","mouse xenograft model","effects","study","data","addition","common cancers","females","Endometrial cancer"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread. Methods We modeled the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes. We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and Daegu/Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method. Results The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide. Using these estimated parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June. Conclusion We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high per-capita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a large-scale transmission of COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in the Republic of Korea. Since the outbreak is expected to continue until May, nonpharmaceutical interventions that can be sustained over the long term are required.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Soyoung; Seo, Yu Bin; Jung, Eunok","journal":"Epidemiology and health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2020026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Daegu/Gyeongbuk"],"locations":["Daegu","Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["Daegu","large-scale transmission of COVID","Republic of Korea","Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates","pattern of local transmission of COVID","mathematical model of transmission","capita rate of transmission","Korea Centers","behavioral changes","average of nationwide","estimated parameters","outbreak","low rate of changes","behavioral change parameters","Prevention data of daily confirmed cases","mathematical modeling","Disease Control","factors","country","epidemic size","timing","times higher","number of transmissions","infected patient","end","report","models","squares method","spread","nonpharmaceutical interventions","long term","Objectives","Methods","study","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard.

While school feeding programs are ubiquitous in LMICs, the specific benefits of school feeding programs are unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the impacts of school feeding programs on the educational and health outcomes of children and adolescents in LMICs. METHODS Rigorously designed interventional studies on the impacts of school feeding on nutritional and health outcomes of children and adolescents receiving primary or secondary education in LMICs will be included. The following information sources were used to identify relevant published or unpublished studies: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and governmental or organizational websites. The risk of bias of randomized and non-randomized studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the ROBINS-I tool, respectively. Two reviewers will independently conduct the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis of all the included studies will be provided. Meta-analyses will be performed whenever appropriate. Heterogeneity of effects will be assessed by I2, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression. The certainty of evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DISCUSSION The design and implementation of school feeding programs in LMICs should be based on the understanding of the benefits of such programs.

This impacts patients with dysphagia complications caused by head and neck cancers. As this pandemic of COVID-19 may last longer than SARS in 2003, a practical workflow for managing dysphagia is crucial to ensure a safe and efficient practice to patients and healthcare personnel. This document provides clinical practice guidelines based on available evidence to date to balance the risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with the risks associated with dysphagia. Critical considerations include reserving instrumental assessments for urgent cases only, optimizing the non-instrumental swallowing evaluation, appropriate use of PPE, and use of telehealth when appropriate. Despite significant limitations in clinical service provision during the pandemic of COVID-19, a safe and reasonable dysphagia care pathway can still be implemented with modifications of setup and application of newer technologies.

AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential. To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation. For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients. During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis. In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bu, Jun; Chen, Mao; Cheng, Xiaoshu; Dong, Yifei; Fang, Weiyi; Ge, Junbo; Gong, Yanjun; He, Ben; Huang, Lan; Huo, Yong; Jia, Shaobin; Jiang, Jun; Li, Yue; Li, Zhao; Liang, Chun; Liu, Xuebo; Liu, Zhenyu; Ma, Xiang; Ma, Yitong; Qian, Juying; Shen, Chengxing; Shen, Difei; Shen, Li; Shi, Ruizheng; Su, Xi; Sun, Yingxian; Tang, Yida; Wang, Jianan; Wu, Yue; Xiang, Dingcheng; Xu, Tongda; Xu, Yawei; Yang, Yuejin; Zeng, Hesong; Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Guogang; Zhang, Ruiyan; Zhang, Shuning; Zhang, Yun; Zhang, Zheng; Zheng, Bo; Zhou, Ning","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMI"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["treatment of AMI patients","treatment process of patients","Nearby treatment","different treatment strategies","active on-site treatment","short optimal treatment window","patient transport","acute onset","epidemic","SARS-CoV","diagnosis","management","time window of STEMI onset","respiratory infections","Priority of thrombolysis","contraindications of thrombolysis","interventional physicians","particular time","acute myocardial infarction","screening results of SARS","frequent complications","appropriate protective measurements","circulatory failure","fatal consequence","Safety protection","Key Principles","medical staff","cardiologists","hospitals","vital signs","adjustments","influences","procedures","guidelines","Remote consultation","special period","control measures","Wuhan","nation"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, CT images and treatment of COVID-19 patients from three different cities in China. METHODS 476 patients were recruited from Jan 1 to Feb 15, 2020 at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai and Anhui. Patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical group) according to the fifth version of the guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China on Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Compared with moderate group (37.8%), the incidence of comorbidities was higher in severe (46.3%) and critical groups (67.1%). Compared with severe and critical groups, there were more patients taking ACEI/ARB in moderate group. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group as compared to moderate group. Compared with the moderate group, more patients received antiviral agents within first 4 days than in severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteriods in critical and severe groups. Patients over 75 years old had significantly lower survival rate than the younger patients. CONCLUSION Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of severe and critical patients. There was a significant difference in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers usage among patients with different severities. Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Advanced age (\u226575 years) was a risk factor for mortality.

METHODS Consecutive patients diagnosed with PFis and asymptomatic subjects were enrolled in the present study. Both groups underwent clinical, ultrasound (US), and SWE evaluation. A plantar fascia thickness \u003E 4 mm was considered pathognomonic of PFis. SWE stiffness elasticity (Young\u0027s modulus in kPa and shear wave velocity in m/s) was measured 1 cm distally from the calcaneal insertion. Correlations with VAS and the 17-Italian Foot Function Index (17-FFI) were determined. RESULTS A total of 19 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria for the patient group and were enrolled in the study, and 21 healthy subjects were used as a control group. Statistically significant differences were found for shear wave velocity between the patient and the control group, with SWE findings of 3.8 (5.1; 1.5) m/s and 4.7 (4.07; 7.04) m/s, respectively (p = 0.006). Strong positive correlations were found between the SWE findings and both the pain and the functional scale (VAS: p = 0.001; FFI: p = 0.012). CONCLUSION SWE allows quantitative assessment of the stiffness of the plantar fascia and can show PFis alterations, increasing the diagnostic performance of B-mode US. In addition, SWE shows a strong correlation with clinical scores, improving patient assessment and follow-up.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schillizzi, Giuseppe; Alviti, Federica; D\u0027Ercole, Chiara; Elia, Daniela; Agostini, Francesco; Mangone, Massimiliano; Paoloni, Marco; Bernetti, Andrea; Pacini, Patrizia; Polti, Giorgia; Minafra, Paolo; Cantisani, Vito","journal":"Journal of ultrasound","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40477-020-00474-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SWE","VAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SWE findings","SWE values","CONCLUSION SWE","SWE evaluation","SWE stiffness elasticity","patient group","asymptomatic healthy control group","shear wave velocity","PFis alterations","patient assessment","clinical scores","pathognomonic of PFis","shear wave elastography","asymptomatic subjects","healthy subjects","plantar fasciitis","VAS","plantar fascia thickness","FFI","present study","METHODS Consecutive patients","Strong positive correlations","elasticity features","mode US","strong correlation","quantitative assessment","Young\u0027s modulus","kPa","diagnostic performance of B","pain","inclusion criteria","Italian Foot Function Index","functional scale","ultrasound","significant differences","groups","follow-up","addition","PURPOSE","aim","total","calcaneal insertion"],"language":"en"},

However, the fear of provoking laryngospasm may cause avoidance of deep or sedated extubation techniques which could reduce coughing and infection risk. This fear may be alleviated with clear understanding of the mechanisms and effective management of post-extubation airway obstruction including laryngospasm. We review the dynamic function of the larynx from the vantage point of head-and-neck surgery, highlighting two key concepts: 1. The larynx is a complex organ that may occlude reflexively at levels other than the true vocal folds; 2. The widely held belief that positive-pressure ventilation by mask can \u0022break\u0022 laryngospasm is not supported by the otorhinolaryngology literature. We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sibert, Karen S; Long, Jennifer L; Haddy, Steven M","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32440387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["smooth extubation","review","sedated extubation techniques","effective management of post-extubation airway obstruction","avoidance of coughing","fear of provoking laryngospasm","optimal management of upper airway obstruction","expectoration of secretions","larynx","differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction","avoidance of deep","infectious aerosolized secretions","mechanisms","clinical pathway","mask","positive-pressure ventilation","neck surgery","clear understanding","vantage point of head","levels","anesthesiologists","break","intensivists","intubation","adverse outcomes","COVID","true vocal folds","pandemic","key concepts","belief","complex organ","dynamic function","infection risk","coronavirus disease","basis","otorhinolaryngology literature"],"language":"en"},

This analysis of data from that region on health care workers (HCWs) awareness and attitudes towards the prevention and control of MERS-CoV may be useful when planning health education programmes about this emerging infectious disease. Aims We aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitude of HCWs toward MERS-CoV in south-western Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross sectional study was conducted on HCWs in primary health care centres and hospitals at Najran. A questionnaire containing 14 knowledge and 8 attitude items was completed by all 870 participants. Results Overall, \u003E 80% of HCWs were aware about MERS-CoV etiology, mode of transmission, risk factors, and signs and symptoms. Knowledge scores revealed 51% of participants had sufficient knowledge. Physicians and nurses had significantly better knowledge compared with other HCWs (P = 0.001).

Methods: The tracking of all the close contacts of the first COVID-19 case and epidemiological investigation were conducted on January 29, 2020 after a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 related with a Buddhism rally on January 19 (the 1.19 rally) in Ningbo occurred. The swabs of nose/throat of the cases and close contacts were collected and tested for nucleic acids by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. Results: From January 26 to February 20, 2020, a total of 67 COVID-19 cases and 15 asymptomatic infection cases related with the 1.19 rally were reported in Ningbo. The initial case was the infection source who infected 29 second generation cases and 4 asymptomatic infection cases, in whom 23 second generation cases and 3 asymptomatic infection cases once took bus with the initial case, the attack rate was 33.82% (23/68) and the infection rate was 38.24% (26/68). The risks of suffering from COVID-19 and being infected were 28.91 times and 26.01 times higher in rally participants taking bus with initial case compared with those taking no bus with initial case. In this epidemic, 37 third\u002B generation cases and 11 related asymptomatic infection cases occurred, the attack rate was 2.88% (37/1 283) and the infection rate was 4.76% (48/1 008).

Colonization has affected indigenous peoples\u0027 levels of trust with institutions, and their world view tends to be distinct from that of nonindigenous people. Building on a programme theory for SDM, the present research aims to refine the original programme theory to understand how the mechanisms of trust and world view might work differently for indigenous patients. DESIGN We used a six-step iterative process for realist synthesis: preliminary programme theory development, search strategy development, selection and appraisal of literature, data extraction, data analysis and synthesis, and formation of a revised programme theory. DATA SOURCES Searches were through Medline, CINAHL, and the University of Saskatchewan iPortal for grey literature. Medline and CINAHL searches included the University of Alberta Canada-wide indigenous peoples search filters. DATA SYNTHESIS Following screening 731 references, 90 documents were included for data extraction (53 peer reviewed and 37 grey literature). Documents from countries with similar colonization experiences were included. RESULTS A total of 518 context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were identified and synthesized into 21 CMOs for a revised programme theory. Demographics, indigenous world view, system and institutional support, language barriers, and the macro-context of discrimination and historical abuse provided the main contexts for the programme theory. These inspired mechanisms of reciprocal respect, perception of world view acceptance, and culturally appropriate knowledge translation. In turn, these mechanisms influenced the level of trust and anxiety experienced by indigenous patients. Trust and anxiety were both mechanisms and intermediate outcomes and determined the level of engagement in SDM. CONCLUSION This realist synthesis provides clinicians and policymakers a deeper understanding of the complex configurations that influence indigenous patient engagement in SDM and offers possible avenues for improvement.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Groot, Gary; Waldron, Tamara; Barreno, Leonzo; Cochran, David; Carr, Tracey","journal":"Journal of evaluation in clinical practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31750600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDM","University of Saskatchewan","University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indigenous world view","revised programme theory","DATA SYNTHESIS","indigenous patients","original programme theory","SDM","mechanisms of trust","preliminary programme theory development","indigenous patient engagement","data extraction","indigenous patient values","indigenous peoples\u0027 levels of trust","realist synthesis","data analysis","level of trust","DATA SOURCES Searches","perception of world view acceptance","grey literature","University of Alberta Canada-wide indigenous peoples","appraisal of literature","CINAHL searches","level of engagement","documents","Medline","anxiety","inspired mechanisms of reciprocal respect","search strategy development","complex configurations","context-mechanism","University of Saskatchewan iPortal","macro-context of discrimination","similar colonization experiences","system","selection","institutional support","historical abuse","language barriers","clinicians","policymakers","institutions","formation","deeper understanding","main contexts","step iterative process","present research","possible avenues","intermediate outcomes","shared decision making","INTRODUCTION","appropriate knowledge translation","countries","filters","screening","peer","Demographics","improvement","CONCLUSION","preferences","CMOs","nonindigenous people","total","turn","DESIGN"],"language":"en"},

It aids individuals in reducing uncertainty about the knowledge of the environment and helps them in acquiring an adaptive behaviour at a lower cost than by learning it by themselves. Among the copying strategies, conformity, which is the copying of behavioural decisions presented by the majority, has been well studied and reported in many animals, including humans. The previous study showed that dogs did not conform to their multiple conspecific individuals; however, dogs have evolved to increase their adaptability while living with humans, and it is plausible that dogs have selected appropriate behaviour according to the behaviour of humans. Therefore, we investigated which factors influenced the choice of dogs in a situation where they have to choose one of two numerically unbalanced human groups. The results showed that the dogs followed the human majority group under certain conditions, depending on the familiarity with the human demonstrators. These results are important in considering the significance of groups for dogs and the factors of group formation, and will also provide a clue as to how dogs have penetrated into human society.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagasawa, Miho; Mogi, Kazutaka; Ohtsuki, Hisashi; Kikusui, Takefumi","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64058-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["choice of dogs","behaviour of humans","human majority group","appropriate behaviour","others\u0027 behaviour","adaptive behaviour","human demonstrators","human society","unbalanced human groups","copying strategies","results","factors of group formation","copying of behavioural decisions","significance of groups","multiple conspecific individuals","certain conditions","familiarity","uncertainty","knowledge","attention","researchers","lower cost","conformity","environment","previous study","situation","adaptability","animals","clue"],"language":"en"},

However, detailed studies on the vascular influence of individual pure isoflavonoids are mostly missing. For this study, 16 isoflavonoids were initially screened for their vasorelaxant properties on rat aortas. The 2 most potent of them, biochanin A and glycitein, were further tested for the mechanism of action on porcine coronary arteries. They both induced an endothelium independent vascular relaxation, with EC50 below 6 and 17 \u00B5M, respectively. Biochanin A, but not glycitein, was able to block the vasoconstriction caused by KCl, CaCl2, serotonin, and U46619 in a dose-dependent manner. Another series of experiments suggested that the major mechanism of action of biochanin A was the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, biochanin A in relatively small concentrations (2 - 4 \u00B5M) interfered with the cGMP, but not cAMP, pathway in isolated coronary arteries. These results indicate that some isoflavonoids, in particular biochanin A, are able to have vasodilatory effects in micromolar concentrations, which is of potential clinical interest for the management of cardiovascular pathologies.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Migkos, Thomas; Pourov\u00E1, Jana; Vopr\u0161alov\u00E1, Marie; Auger, Cyril; Schini-Kerth, Val\u00E9rie; Mlad\u011Bnka, P\u0159emysl","journal":"Planta medica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1158-9422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["particular biochanin","consumption of isoflavonoids","\u00B5M","glycitein","vascular influence of individual pure isoflavonoids","major mechanism of action","isolated coronary arteries","porcine coronary arteries","micromolar concentrations","small concentrations","cardiovascular mortality","management of cardiovascular pathologies","endothelium independent vascular relaxation","variety of isoflavonoid","U46619","EC50","cAMP","pathway","inhibition","CaCl2","serotonin","use of food supplements","vasodilatory effects","vasorelaxant properties","detailed studies","dose-dependent manner","rat aortas","KCl","type calcium channels","rich foods","vasoconstriction","cGMP","series of experiments","general population","dietary intake of flavonoids","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanders, James M; Monogue, Marguerite L; Jodlowski, Tomasz Z; Cutrell, James B","journal":"JAMA","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.6019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","COVID","proven effective therapies","effective drugs","potential therapies","Current clinical evidence","pandemic of coronavirus disease","clinical data","effective medical treatments","accurate evidence","volume of clinical trials","high-quality evidence","pandemic influenza outbreak","remdesivir","need","significant number of potential drug targets","Drug Administration","angiotensin receptor blockers","large number of people","ongoing randomized trials","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","greatest global public health crisis","clinicians","enzyme inhibitors","patients","highlight","virology","rapid pace of scientific discovery","generation","prevention","capability","unprecedented challenge","activity","US Food","infection","speed","Importance","middle","Observations","Relevance","expanding knowledge","promising therapy","Conclusions","date","efficacy","corticosteroids","Oseltamivir"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to explore the value of CT in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, especially for patients who have negative initial results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 19, 2020, to February 20, 2020, were included. All patients underwent chest CT and swab RT-PCR tests within 3 days. Patients were divided into groups with negative (seven patients) and positive (14 patients) initial RT-PCR results. The imaging findings in both groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS. Twenty-one patients with symptoms (nine men, 12 women; age range, 26-90 years) were evaluated. Most of the COVID-19 lesions were located in multiple lobes (67%) in both lungs (72%) in our study. The main CT features were ground-glass opacity (95%) and consolidation (72%) with a subpleural distribution (100%). Otherwise, 33% of patients had other lesions around the bronchovascular bundle. The other CT features included air bronchogram (57%), vascular enlargement (67%), interlobular septal thickening (62%), and pleural effusions (19%). Compared with that in the group with positive initial RT-PCR results, CT of the group with negative initial RT-PCR results was less likely to show pulmonary consolidation (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION. The less pulmonary consolidation found at CT, the greater is the possibility of negative initial RT-PCR results. Chest CT is important in the screening of patients in whom disease is clinically suspected, especially those who have negative initial RT-PCR results.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Dandan; Jiang, Xinqing; Hong, Yong; Wen, Zhihui; Wei, Shuquan; Peng, Guangming; Wei, Xinhua","journal":"AJR.

This is then discounted by the proximity of the neighbor to prioritize the closer instances in the local neighborhood. These evidences are then combined using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.

In particular, the canonical inverse Lyndon factorization [Formula: see text], introduced in [5], maintains the main properties of the Lyndon factorization since it can be computed in linear time and it is uniquely determined. In this paper we investigate new properties of this factorization with the purpose of exploring its use in string queries. As a main result, we prove an upper bound on the length of the longest common extension (or longest common prefix) for two factors of a word w. This bound is at most the maximum length of two consecutive factors of [Formula: see text]. A tool used in the proof is a property that we state for factors with nonempty borders in [Formula: see text]: a nonempty border of a factor [Formula: see text] cannot be a prefix of the next factor [Formula: see text]. Another interesting result relates sorting of global suffixes, i.e., suffixes of a word w, and sorting of local suffixes, i.e., suffixes of the factors in [Formula: see text]. Finally, given a word w and a factor x of w, we prove that their Lyndon factorizations share factors, except for the first and last term of the Lyndon factorization of x. This property suggests that, given two words sharing a common overlap, their Lyndon factorizations could be used to capture the common overlap of these two words.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonizzoni, Paola; De Felice, Clelia; Zaccagnino, Rocco; Zizza, Rosalba","journal":"Language and Automata Theory and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef53ee9a3df47224a44924817dc5061d6c27a2cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206627.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lyndon"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Formula","Lyndon factorization of","Lyndon factorizations","word w","canonical inverse Lyndon factorization","common prefix","common overlap","consecutive factors","sorting of global suffixes","sorting of local suffixes","factor x of w","longest common extension","main result","main properties","words","property","interesting result","maximum length","nonempty borders","new properties","purpose","use","string queries","different contexts","variants","proof","paper","term","linear time","tool"],"language":"en"},

Ontario\u2019s mid-stakes tests were meant to ensure accountability and transparency, and assure system-wide improvement, while avoiding the negative effects and perverse incentives of their high-stakes counterparts. The paper provides new evidence from two projects covering almost a 10-year time-span in 10 of Ontario\u2019s 72 school districts. It shows that even though mid-stakes testing is milder in its manifestations and effects than high-stakes testing, concerns remain about the need for and side effects of such testing. The findings concern two periods of Ontario educational reform. In the first period, with a specific focus on improving performance in literacy and mathematics, administrators and special education support staff felt that the assessments raised teachers\u2019 expectations and sense of urgency leading to steady improvements in measured achievement, but that there was also evidence of negative effects, especially on paying undue attention to \u201Cbubble\u201D students just below the threshold for minimum proficiency. In the second reform period focused on broad excellence, well-being and equity as inclusion, mid-stakes tests were perceived as having more widespread negative effects. These included teaching to the test, cultural bias, avoidance of innovation, dilemmas of whether to include highly vulnerable students in the testing process or not, and emotional ill-being among students and teachers. The paper concludes that Ontario\u2019s twentieth century system of large scale, mid-stakes assessment has not kept pace with its twenty first century commitments to deeper learning and stronger well-being.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hargreaves, A.","journal":"J Educ Change","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/017e05296a1ab3633accd760afa874e0d4847093.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7213542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EQAO"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["perceived effects of mid-stakes testing","high-stakes testing","mid-stakes assessment","Ontario\u2019s mid-stakes tests","evidence of negative effects","high-stakes counterparts","widespread negative effects","testing process","paper","vulnerable students","reform period","century system of large scale","century commitments","stronger well-being","periods of Ontario educational reform","new evidence","system-wide improvement","administrators","equity","cultural bias","sense of urgency","literacy","assessments","mathematics","special education support staff","inclusion","manifestations","broad excellence","perverse incentives","steady improvements","performance","deeper learning","pace","nature","avoidance of innovation","teachers\u2019 expectations","emotional ill-being","undue attention","dilemmas","specific focus","threshold","bubble","projects","accountability","EQAO","concerns","measured achievement","included teaching","year time-span","findings","transparency","need","minimum proficiency","school districts","Canada"],"language":"en"},

In the first stage, a multicriteria model is developed for each of the conflicting parties, taken as decision makers (DMs) facing evaluations of a set of alternatives according to proper criteria. In the second stage, the composition of probabilistic preferences (CPP) methodology is applied to identify the best alternative for each of the conflicting parties. In the third stage, negotiation is carried out to remove alternatives and to focus on the subset of best alternatives for the group of DMs. The fourth stage consists of applying CPP again to choose one among the remaining alternatives. The model is illustrated by means of applying it to a real-world conflict in Brazil, related to implementation of the New Recife Project. The main features of the model are that it allows the DMs (i) to understand differences and proximities among the positions of each of them, (ii) to strategically reduce the initial set of alternatives, (iii) to advance in their positions towards a common goal, and (iv) to construct a unique final solution quickly.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sant\u2019anna, Annibal P.; Costa, Ana Paula C.

We build a multi-agent system (MAS(IITIB)) in the context of social networks to model the mutual influence among agents\u2019 intentions and the transformation from agents\u2019 intentions to their behaviors in groups. On the micro level of individual agents, we construct the self-evolution rule of agents\u2019 intentions and the generation, constraint and termination rule of agents\u2019 behaviors; on the macro level of networked structure, we describe the mutual influence on intentions among agents, which can be diversified in both strength and polarity. We detail this multi-agent system and run experiments and simulations using the interaction of fertility intentions and the generation of fertility behaviors in families as example. Two experimental programs are designed: one is to adjust the initial fertility intentions of prospective parents, and the other is to adjust the range of weight of influence among family members, to investigate the effects on the childbearing behavior and the number of newborn children in the long-term. This study intends to provide modeling bases for the dynamics of preferences and behaviors due to mutual influence among agents in groups, particularly for the study of fertility intention and behavior in families, and more broadly, the forecast of population growth and effects of fertility policy. It is an innovative try of distributed artificial intelligence (multi-agent system) in the field of demography and public policy, and provides with a new bottom-to-up perspective and unconventional agent-based method.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Hang; Wang, Zhenjie; Yang, Shengzi; Yang, Hanmo; Gong, Yuke","journal":"Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a353620343d6dc01837d2e1b1f462f4e5582075f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215184.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of fertility intentions","generation of fertility behaviors","agents\u2019 preferences","mutual influence","multi-agent system","termination rule of agents\u2019 behaviors","self-evolution rule of agents\u2019 intentions","initial fertility intentions of prospective parents","effects of fertility policy","study of fertility intention","families","groups","unconventional agent-based method","micro level of individual agents","dynamics of preferences","childbearing behavior","public policy","macro level of networked structure","constraint","innovative try of distributed artificial intelligence","simulations","transformation","perspective","negotiation","field of demography","IITIB","experiments","number of newborn children","family members","settings of group decision","forecast of population growth","modeling bases","MAS","context of social networks","range of weight","beliefs","example","opinions","strength","polarity","experimental programs"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, the proposed extensions to group decision making mainly use an input oriented aggregation strategy, which requires a high level of agreement between the decision makers. In this paper, we propose an output oriented aggregation strategy to coherently combine different sets of decision rules obtained from different decision makers.

It has infected more than 1.2 million people and killed more than 64,000. Frantic research is underway to find prevention and cure. Of late, Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00E9rin (BCG) has been speculated as a possible protection from COVID-19. We sought to investigate the evidence behind the claim. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected regarding the total number of COVID-19 cases per million and total number of COVID-19 deaths per million in various countries. The BCG vaccination policies of these countries were also obtained. RESULTS: It was seen that the countries with no universal BCG policy had a mean 1272.9 (median 795) cases per million and 80.7 deaths (median 18) per million population. On the contrary, the countries with a universal BCG vaccination policy had a mean 131.2 (median 40) cases per million and 4 deaths (median 1) per population. The difference is highly significant (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: The data strongly support the hypothesis that BCG may offer protection from COVID-19. Heterologous protection offered by BCG through production of trained immunity, epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, non-specific activation of NK cells, and increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (particularly, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and interleukin 1 beta) production may be the mechanism behind its cross- protection against the novel coronavirus.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Soumya","journal":"Indian J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33a2e1453144e432f8b2c933c09d016b41186439.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["universal BCG policy","universal BCG vaccination policy","BCG vaccination policies","cases","deaths","total number of COVID","cross- protection","Heterologous protection","various countries","possible protection","Data","population","novel coronavirus pandemic","production of trained immunity","epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes","non-specific activation of NK cells","tumor necrosis factor","pro-inflammatory cytokines","TNF","prevention","beta","interleukin","Bacillus Calmette","Gu\u00E9rin","mechanism","Frantic research","OBJECTIVE","hypothesis","difference","cure","MATERIAL","METHODS","world","evidence","claim","CONCLUSION","people","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We suggest nicotinamide, a potential poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as a supportive treatment for the prevention of cytokine storm from injuring the lung parenchyma. Nicotinamide supplementation albeit at high dose may modulate outcome in COVID-19. Nicotinamide was used previously to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury and lung injury due to hypoxia.

This success has suggested the application of the same approach to recurrent-state epidemics, for which an individual can contract the epidemic and recover repeatedly. The underlying assumption is that backtracking paths (i.e., an individual is reinfected by a neighbor he or she previously infected) do not play a relevant role. In this paper we show that this is not the case for recurrent-state epidemics since the neglect of backtracking paths leads to a formula for the epidemic threshold that is qualitatively incorrect in the large size limit. Moreover, we define a modified recurrent-state dynamics which explicitly forbids direct backtracking events and show that this modification completely upsets the phenomenology.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castellano, Claudio; Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cd2cdfe419f2c9826ae74ec3cdb2beb740d5ed0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recurrent-state epidemics","neglect of backtracking paths","modified recurrent-state dynamics","understanding of epidemics","individual","direct backtracking events","epidemic threshold","recent application of message","permanent acquired immunity","diseases","irreversible spreading","formula","treelike topologies","large size limit","exact results","approaches","modification","networks","underlying assumption","case","neighbor","relevant role","phenomenology","success","paper"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we consider a behavioral model in which susceptible individuals become alert and adopt a preventive behavior under the local risk perception characterized by a decision-making threshold. The impact of awareness diffusion on the epidemic threshold is investigated under the framework of activity-driven network. Results show that the local epidemic situation in risk perception and the duration of preventive effect are crucial for raising the epidemic threshold.

In general, there are two types of contacts: close ones among friends, colleagues and family members, etc., and ordinary contacts from encounters with strangers. Typically, social reinforcement occurs for close contacts. Taking into account both types of contacts, we develop a contact-based model for social contagion. We find that, associated with the spreading dynamics, for random networks there is coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, but for heterogeneous networks the transition is continuous. We also find that ordinary contacts play a crucial role in promoting large-scale spreading, and the number of close contacts determines not only the nature of the phase transitions but also the value of the outbreak threshold in random networks. For heterogeneous networks from the real world, the abundance of close contacts affects the epidemic threshold, while its role in facilitating the spreading depends on the adoption threshold assigned to it. We uncover two striking phenomena. First, a strong interplay between ordinary and close contacts is necessary for generating prevalent spreading. In fact, only when there are propagation paths of reasonable length which involve both close and ordinary contacts are large-scale outbreaks of social contagions possible. Second, abundant close contacts in heterogeneous networks promote both outbreak and spreading of the contagion through the transmission channels among the hubs, when both values of the threshold and transmission rate among ordinary contacts are small. We develop a theoretical framework to obtain an analytic understanding of the main findings on random networks, with support from extensive numerical computations. Overall, ordinary contacts facilitate spreading over the entire network, while close contacts determine the way by which outbreaks occur, i.e., through a second- or first-order phase transition. These results provide quantitative insights into how certain social behaviors can emerge and become prevalent, which has potential implications not only to social science but also to economics and political science.","publish_time":"2018-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Peng-Bi; Wang, Wei; Cai, Shi-Min; Zhou, Tao; Lai, Ying-Cheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a2277d3ce4877659db6f64c3f15924368a21c04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217557.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ordinary contacts","types of contacts","abundance of close contacts","number of close contacts","abundant close contacts","role of social contacts","close ones","random networks","heterogeneous networks","social science","large-scale spreading","prevalent spreading","spreading dynamics","social reinforcement","outbreak threshold","certain social behaviors","epidemic threshold","contagion dynamics","adoption threshold","large-scale outbreaks of social contagions possible","discontinuous phase transitions","crucial role","order phase transition","transmission rate","coexistence of continuous","transmission channels","political science","support","friends","analytic understanding","main findings","real world","quantitative insights","colleagues","family members","contact-based model","entire network","propagation paths of reasonable length","extensive numerical computations","values","economics","potential implications","strong interplay","nature","theoretical framework","results","hubs","encounters","strangers","outstanding problem of interdisciplinary","account","way","striking phenomena","fact"],"language":"en"},

We derive analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics, as well as upper and lower bounds for the disease prevalence in the steady state for the SIS scenario. Using the quasistationary state method, we numerically show the existence of disease localization and the emergence of two or more susceptibility peaks, which are characterized analytically and numerically through the inverse participation ratio. At variance with what is observed in single-layer networks, we show that disease localization takes place on the layers and not on the nodes of a given layer. Furthermore, when mapping the critical dynamics to an eigenvalue problem, we observe a characteristic transition in the eigenvalue spectra of the supra-contact tensor as a function of the ratio of two spreading rates: If the rate at which the disease spreads within a layer is comparable to the spreading rate across layers, the individual spectra of each layer merge with the coupling between layers. Finally, we report on an interesting phenomenon, the barrier effect; i.e., for a three-layer configuration, when the layer with the lowest eigenvalue is located at the center of the line, it can effectively act as a barrier to the disease.

Data came from the 2014 Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating Study (FLASHE), a cross-sectional internet study from the National Cancer Institute.

Actor Partner Interdependence Models in Mplus with demographic covariates tested whether parent and adolescent perceived social isolation (2 items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale) were associated with each person\u2019s self-reported health. Most dyads included a mother (38% mother\u2013daughter, 36% mother\u2013son). Most parents were non-Hispanic White (69%), married/partnered (77%), and reported household income below $100,000 (79%). Both social isolation and self-reported health were significantly correlated between parents and their adolescent children (Pearson correlation = .38 for isolation, .32 for health). There were negative associations between parent isolation and parent health, adolescent isolation and adolescent health, and parent isolation and adolescent health (all ps \u003C .05), but no association between adolescent isolation and parent health. The finding that parents\u2019 social isolation was linked to lower self-reported health not only for themselves but also for their adolescent children highlights the importance of addressing social isolation in clinical social work practice. Family interventions, or interventions to reduce adults\u2019 negative social cognitions or promote social connections, may improve health for both adults and their adolescent children.","publish_time":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Tess; Rodebaugh, Thomas L.; Bessaha, Melissa L.; Sabbath, Erika L.","journal":"Clin Soc Work J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38e8498f280dac70932c953a01522071df3ef918.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Cancer Institute","Actor Partner Interdependence Models"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adolescent health","adolescent isolation","parent health","parent isolation","adolescent children","adolescent perceived social isolation","parents\u2019 social isolation","lower self-reported health","person\u2019s self-reported health","social connections","adults\u2019 negative social cognitions","mother","clinical social work practice","Family interventions","reported household income","dyads","negative associations","physical activity","Family Life","cross-sectional internet study","Mplus","demographic covariates","items","Actor Partner Interdependence Models","diet","FLASHE","National Cancer Institute","importance","Pearson correlation","demographics","surveys","analyses","daughter","ages","UCLA Loneliness Scale","analyzed variables","information","finding","relationship","ps","member","Data"],"language":"en"},

Highly virulent strains of Psa biovar3 (Psa3) have spread rapidly to kiwifruit production areas worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop critical management strategies for bacterial canker based on dissecting the interactions between Psa and kiwifruit. Here, we developed a rapid and reliable flood-inoculation method using kiwifruit seedlings grown on Murashige and Skoog medium. This method has several advantages over inoculation of conventional soil-grown plants. We demonstrated the utility of a kiwifruit seedling assay to study the virulence of Psa biovars and Psa3 virulence factors, including the type III secretion system (T3SS). Kiwifruit seedlings inoculated with Psa3 developed severe necrosis within 1 week, whereas those inoculated with a T3SS-deficient hrcN mutant of Psa3 did not. This method was also useful for analyzing expression profiles of genes involved in Psa3 virulence during infection, and revealed that the expression of genes encoding the T3SS and type III secreted effectors were strongly induced in planta. Our results indicate that the T3SS has an important role in Psa3 virulence, and the flood-inoculation assay using kiwifruit seedling is suitable for analyzing Psa and kiwifruit interactions.

The clinical use of SCs in nerve regeneration strategies is hindered by the necessity of removing a healthy nerve to obtain the therapeutic cells. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be chemically differentiated towards a SC-like phenotype (dASCs), and represent a promising alternative to SCs. Their physiology can be further modulated pharmacologically by targeting receptors for neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh). In this study, we compare the ability of rat dASCs and native SCs to produce NGF in vitro. We also evaluate the ability of muscarinic receptors, in particular the M2 subtype, to modulate NGF production and maturation from the precursor (proNGF) to the mature (mNGF) form. For the first time, we demonstrate that dASCs produce higher basal levels of proNGF and mature NGF compared to SCs. Moreover, muscarinic receptor activation, and in particular M2 subtype stimulation, modulates NGF production and maturation in both SCs and dASCs. Indeed, both cell types express both proNGF A and B isoforms, as well as mNGF. After M2 receptor stimulation, proNGF-B (25 kDa), which is involved in apoptotic processes, is strongly reduced at transcript and protein level. Thus, we demonstrate that dASCs possess a stronger neurotrophic potential compared to SCs. ACh, via M2 muscarinic receptors, contributes to the modulation and maturation of NGF, improving the regenerative properties of dASCs.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piovesana, R; Faroni, A; Taggi, M; Matera, A; Soligo, M; Canipari, R; Manni, L; Reid, A J; Tata, A M","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63645-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346125/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Schwann"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maturation of NGF","native SCs","NGF production","mature NGF","M2 muscarinic receptors","proNGF-B","clinical use of SCs","ability of rat dASCs","regenerative properties of dASCs","M2 receptor stimulation","ability of muscarinic receptors","particular M2 subtype stimulation","Schwann cells","muscarinic receptor activation","therapeutic cells","mNGF","higher basal levels of proNGF","healthy nerve","Regenerative capability","B isoforms","Adipose-derived stem cells","nerve regeneration strategies","peripheral nervous system","injury","precursor","necessity","stronger neurotrophic potential","modulation","transcript","cell types","growth factors","promising alternative","protein level","neurotransmitters","acetylcholine","phenotype","kDa","apoptotic processes","study","time","physiology"],"language":"en"},

Omocestus minutissimus and O. uhagonii are two closely related grasshoppers with partially overlapping distributions in the Central System mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. To analyse spatial patterns of historical and/or contemporary hybridization between these two taxa and understand how species boundaries are maintained in the region of secondary contact, we sampled sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species and obtained genome-wide SNP data using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to test the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization in sympatric populations and employed a suite of phylogenomic approaches and a coalescent-based simulation framework to evaluate alternative hypothetical scenarios of interspecific gene flow. Our analyses rejected the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization but revealed past introgression in the area where the distributions of the two species overlap. Overall, these results point to a scenario of historical gene flow after secondary contact followed by the evolution of reproductive isolation that currently prevents hybridization among sympatric populations.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tonzo, Vanina; Papadopoulou, Anna; Ortego, Joaqu\u00EDn","journal":"Molecular ecology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hypothesis of contemporary hybridization","sympatric populations","interruption of gene flow","initial period of hybridization","scenario of historical gene flow","region of secondary contact","isolated gene pools","allopatric populations","species boundaries","alternative hypothetical scenarios of interspecific gene flow","evolution of reproductive isolation","overlapping distributions","spatial patterns of historical","Bayesian clustering analyses","coalescent-based simulation framework","restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach","Central System mountains","genome-wide SNP data","suite of phylogenomic approaches","different processes","completion","lead","uhagonii","Iberian Peninsula","related grasshoppers","admixture","introgression","taxa","close relatives","speciation process","Omocestus minutissimus","area","results"],"language":"en"},

The average size of Ag nanoparticles is shown to be increased with decreasing of the activity of reducing agent (E0) and equals to 3.8 nm, 4.3 nm, and 15.8 nm, respectively, when engaging sodium borohydride (-1.24 V), hydrazine (-1.15 V) and ascorbic acid (-0.35 V). Moreover, it was found that the crystallite size of Ag nanoparticles also had the smallest value for nanocomposites obtained involving NaBH4 as reducing agent. Ag-containing nanocomposites prepared by reduction of silver ions in interpolyelectrolyte-metal complexes while applying a range of reducing agents are characterized by different electrical properties and polymer matrix\u0027 glass transition temperature.

A central question concerning COVID-19 is why some individuals become sick and others not. Many have pointed already at variation in risk factors between individuals. However, the variable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections may, at least in part, be due also to differences between the viral subspecies with which individuals are infected. A more pertinent question is how we are to overcome the current pandemic. A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 would offer significant relief, although vaccine developers have warned that design, testing, and production of vaccines may take a year if not longer. Vaccines are based on a handful of different designs (1), but the earliest vaccines were based on live, attenuated virus. As has been the case for other viruses during earlier pandemics, SARS-CoV-2 will mutate and may naturally attenuate over time (2). What makes the current pandemic unique is that, thanks to state-of-the-art nucleic acid sequencing technologies, we can follow in detail how SARS-CoV-2 evolves while it spreads. We argue that knowledge of naturally emerging attenuated SARS-CoV-2 variants across the globe should be of key interest in our fight against the pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

As providers of inpatient and emergency-based acute neurologic care, we have been attempting to locally prepare for and manage the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on 3 key areas: creating an integrated preparation plan that supports hospital measures; building an optimized, flexible, and redundant workforce; and maintaining a high level of neurologic care in our hospital and across our region despite limited transfer capabilities during the pandemic. This final concern is of key relevance in our region where our tertiary hospital supports numerous smaller community hospitals, typically by providing an open door to patient transfers.

Here we show that the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b is essential to maintain the postnatal thymic medulla by promoting mTEC survival and regulating the expression of TRA genes. Moreover, mice lacking Kdm6b developed pathological autoimmune disorders. Mechanically, Kdm6b exerted its function by reducing repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the promoters of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 and a set of Aire-dependent TRA genes.

To date, only a few studies have investigated the differences between these two wound closure methods in TKA. Accordingly, this study aimed to compare cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction between staples and subcuticular suture for post-TKA wound closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients scheduled to undergo TKA at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during June 2018-March 2019. Patients were randomized into the staples or subcuticular suture groups. Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale (HWES), cosmetic-visual analogue scale (VAS), and patient satisfaction-VAS were evaluated at the 6-week and 3-month follow-ups. Functional outcome by the modified Knee Society Knee Scoring System and wound complications were also assessed. RESULTS Sixty-two patients (31 per group) were included. There were no significant differences in the HWES, cosmetic-VAS, patient satisfaction-VAS, or wound complication rate between groups at the 6-week or 3-month follow-ups. Wound closure time was significantly shorter in the staples group (p \u003C 0.001), but the total operative time was not significantly different between groups. Modified knee score was significantly better in the suture group at 6 weeks (p = 0.024), but there was no significant difference between groups at 3 months. Significant association was observed between patient satisfaction-VAS and cosmetic-VAS at the 6-week (p = 0.03) and 3-month (p = 0.021) follow-ups. CONCLUSION Subcuticular suture and staples were found to be comparable wound-closure options after TKA relative to cosmetic outcome, patient satisfaction, functional outcome, and wound complication rate at 3-months post-operation.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nepal, Sarthak; Ruangsomboon, Pakpoom; Udomkiat, Pacharapol; Unnanuntana, Aasis","journal":"Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-020-03479-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["INTRODUCTION Staples","TKA","Knee Society Knee Scoring System"],"locations":["Bangkok","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["cosmetic-VAS","wound closure methods","patient satisfaction-VAS","Wound closure time","post-TKA wound closure","wound closure techniques","wound complications","cosmetic outcome","wound complication rate","subcuticular suture groups","comparable wound-closure options","staples group","CONCLUSION Subcuticular suture","Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale","Functional outcome","TKA relative","INTRODUCTION Staples","patients","month follow-ups","significant differences","total knee arthroplasty","Modified knee score","cosmetic-visual analogue scale","modified Knee Society Knee Scoring System","HWES","Significant association","months post-operation","total operative time","prospective randomized controlled trial","Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of Siriraj Hospital","Bangkok","MATERIALS","Thailand","weeks","studies","RESULTS","study","date"],"language":"en"},

Results of an Observational Study in the First Month of Confinement.","doi":"10.31616/asj.2020.0197","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32380582","license":"unk","abstract":"Study Design Observational study. Purpose The actual sanitary crisis led to a massive mobilization of the sanitary system toward intensive care units and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, some patients still require spinal interventions. The present study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spine surgical in a moderate COVID-19 cluster region. Overview of Literature Previous studies have reported screening and management of patients with spinal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to date, knowledge, no observational study on spine surgeries during the pandemic has not been reported. Methods Between March 17, 2020 and April 17, 2020, information on spine surgical activity was prospectively collected at our institution. This surgical activity related to the first month of confinement in France was compared to the activity during the same period in 2019 to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activities. Results In order to reduce the contamination rate of patients and medical staff during hospitalization, the spine department was completely reorganized. Non-urgent elective spine surgeries were cancelled. When considering the global amount of surgeries procedures during the first month of confinement, a decrease of almost 50% was observed in the number of surgical procedures. During the study period, 62 patients were eligible for spine surgery. The numbers of patients managed for tumor and infectious cases were stable, while a considerable reduction was observed in the number of trauma and degenerative cases. During the follow-up period, two patients were tested as COVID\u002B during the postoperative course, and no cases of medical or paramedical staff contamination were reported using polymerase chain reaction-testing. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to maintain spine surgical activity. Each surgical procedure must be discussed and organized with all the caregivers involved. Indications for surgery must be in line with the scientific guidelines and adapted to each healthcare facility.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Mikael; Prost, Sol\u00E8ne; Farah, Kaissar; Denis, Jean-Baptiste; Dufour, Henry; Blondel, Benjamin; Fuentes, St\u00E9phane","journal":"Asian spine journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.31616/asj.2020.0197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Design Observational"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["spine surgical activity","pandemic","management of patients","spine surgery","moderate COVID","spine department","numbers of patients","study period","surgical activities","number of surgical procedures","contamination rate of patients","Study Design Observational study","present study","Non-urgent elective spine surgeries","cases of medical","surgeries procedures","infectious cases","degenerative cases","impact","month of confinement","follow-up period","paramedical staff contamination","sanitary system","spinal conditions","number of trauma","spinal interventions","management of coronavirus disease","actual sanitary crisis","intensive care units","massive mobilization","screening","tumor","hospitalization","polymerase chain reaction-testing","Overview of Literature Previous studies","knowledge","scientific guidelines","considerable reduction","postoperative course","order","cluster region","date","France","information","healthcare facility","Indications","Results","decrease","Conclusions","institution","Methods","caregivers"],"language":"en"},

Standardized submission data and test results were used. Historical data (2015-2017) composed of the weekly percentage of PCR-positive submissions were used to fit a cyclic robust regression model. The findings were used to forecast the expected weekly percentage of PCR-positive submissions, with a 95% confidence interval (CI), for 2018. During 2018, the proportion of PRRSV-positive submissions crossed 95% CI boundaries at week 2, 14-25, and 48. The relatively higher detection on week 2 and 48 were mostly from submissions containing samples from wean-to-market pigs, and for week 14-25 originated mostly from samples from adult/sow farms. There was a recurring yearly pattern of detection, wherein an increased proportion of PRRSV RNA detection in submissions originating from wean-to-finish farms was followed by increased detection in samples from adult/sow farms.

As we learn about the virus and the pandemic, it is becoming evident that it is an age-associated problem that affects the human population. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. These are large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses. Our knowledge of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is extremely recent but is growing daily. There are currently no antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention. The long term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain but extrapolations can be made about the potential effects of the virus on cellular lifespan as well as on organismal healthspan. Here, we posit that severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 infection may, in the long-term, lead to accelerated aging phenotypes in survivors, not only in affected tissues but also in other organs, including the brain. Since some of the effects could manifest months or years after infection, it will be necessary to follow carefully people affected by coronavirus disease 2019. Keeping accurate registries may enable us to, in the future, establish connections with aging-associated disorders, such as Parkinson\u0027s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

However, the ideal dose and availability of butorphanol for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluated the 95% effective dose (ED95) of butorphanol and sufentanil in GI endoscopy and compared their clinical efficacy, especially regarding the recovery time. METHODS The study was divided into two parts. For the first part, voluntary patients who needed GI endoscopy anesthesia were recruited to measure the ED95 of butorphanol and sufentanil needed to achieve successful sedation before GI endoscopy using the sequential method (the Dixon up-and-down method). The second part was a double-blind, randomized study. Two hundred cases of painless GI endoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 100), including group B (butorphanol at the ED95 dose) and group S (sufentanil at the ED95 dose). Propofol was infused intravenously as the sedative in both groups. The recovery time, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, hand grip strength, fatigue severity scores, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and incidence of dizziness were recorded. RESULTS The ED95 of butorphanol for painless GI endoscopy was 9.07 \u03BCg/kg (95% confidence interval: 7.81-19.66 \u03BCg/kg). The ED95 of sufentanil was 0.1 \u03BCg/kg (95% CI, 0.079-0.422 \u03BCg/kg). Both butorphanol and sufentanil provided a good analgesic effect for GI endoscopy. However, the recovery time for butorphanol was significantly shorter than that for sufentanil (P \u003C 0.05, group B vs. group S:21.26 \u00B1 7.70 vs. 24.03 \u00B1 7.80 min). CONCLUSIONS Butorphanol at 9.07 \u03BCg/kg was more effective than sufentanil for GI endoscopy sedation and notably reduced the recovery time.

Resource reallocation will have consequences on the routine management of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). We consider how to mitigate potential adverse effects. RECENT FINDINGS Combination therapy is well established in hypertension. Many guidelines recommend dual antihypertensive therapy as the initial treatment step as this results in faster blood pressure control, albeit with limited evidence of improved outcomes. Control of CVD risk factors through multiclass combination therapy (the polypill) was proposed many years ago. This approach has not been adopted by Western healthcare systems despite improving surrogate outcomes. Recently, the PolyIran trials have demonstrated improved CVD outcomes without increased adverse events, in both primary and secondary prevention.

We present two cases of carotid stenosis associated with free floating thrombus. Both patients shared similar clinical presentation and were managed according to the standard workflow for suspected ischemic strokes from our institution. Conservative management was decided based on a multidisciplinary decision that intervention of any kind would be associated with high risk of periprocedural complications. Complete resolution of the atherosclerotic plaque and free floating thrombus in a short period occurred. We further discuss the mechanism behind such a dramatic radiographic and clinical improvement with medical therapy, hypothesizing that plaque erosion is a plausible explanation, based on pathology studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monteiro, Andre; Cunha, Yasmin; Cortez, Gustavo M; Sauvageau, Eric; Hanel, Ricardo","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Free floating thrombus","elongated thrombus","plaque erosion","underlying unstable atherosclerotic plaque","clinical improvement","carotid arteries","majority of patients","cases of carotid stenosis","similar clinical presentation","medical therapy","arterial wall","circumferential blood flow","kind","suspected ischemic strokes","plausible explanation","acute neurological deficits","standard workflow","short period","multidisciplinary decision","high risk of periprocedural complications","Complete resolution","intervention","pathology studies","institution","aspect","mechanism","Conservative management"],"language":"en"},

The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing. OBJECTIVE To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China. To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19. METHODS Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020. Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed. The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results. RESULTS Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 \u00B1 11.32, 5 males). No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P \u003E 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P \u003C 0.05). Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc. CONCLUSION The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas. Etiological testing should be performed as early as possible for clinically suspected patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Ling; Liu, Kang-Yong; Xue, Fei; Miao, Ya-Fang; Tu, Ping-An; Zhou, Chao","journal":"Archives of Iranian medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271602/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Zhoupu Hospital","GGO"],"locations":["China","Europe","North America","Oceania","Africa","Pudong New District"],"keyphrases":["non-COVID","clinical data of COVID","suspected patients","confirmed patients","screened patients","imaging findings of COVID","diagnostic value of COVID","diagnostic method of COVID","clinical characteristics","early clinical manifestations","clinical symptoms","clinical features","non-outbreak areas","China","nucleic acid testing","early epidemiology","nucleic acid test results","imaging manifestations","Shanghai","chest CTs","Etiological testing","lymphocyte count","focal GGO","subpleural lesions","epidemiological characteristics","consolidation of subpleural distribution","vascular bundle sign","white blood cell count","CONCLUSION","Pudong New District","dyspnea","air bronchi","cough","sore throat","single-center case reports","Zhoupu Hospital","Oceania","North America","plasma C-reactive protein","CRP","fever","mean age","laboratory","METHODS Cross-sectional","ground-glass opacities","Africa","Europe","bronchiectasis","Wuhan","fatigue","novel coronavirus disease","demography","halo nodules","countries","statistical difference","Hubei province","significant differences","groups","number of infected people","places","males","OBJECTIVE","nCoV","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Slum populations may stand out from other settings and present differences in the epidemiology of acute viral infections. We collected nasopharyngeal specimens from 282 children aged \u22645 years with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) during 2005-2006 in one of the largest Brazilian slums. We conducted real-time RT-PCR for 16 respiratory viruses, nested RT-PCR-based typing of rhinoviruses (HRV), and collected clinical symptoms. Viruses were common causes of respiratory disease; with \u22651 virus being detected in 65.2% of patients. We detected 15 different viruses during one year with a predominance of HRV (33.0%) and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV, 12.1%) infections, and a high rate of viral co-infections (28.3%). We observed seasonality of hRSV, HRV and human coronavirus infections, more severe symptoms in hRSV and Influenza virus (FLU) infections and prolonged circulation of seven HRV clusters likely representing distinct serotypes according to genomic sequence distances. Potentially unusual findings included absence of human metapneumovirus detections and lack of typical FLU seasonal patterns, which may be linked to the population size and density of the slum. Nonetheless, most epidemiological patterns were similar to other studies globally, suggesting surprising similarities of virus-associated ARI across highly diverse settings and differential impact of population characteristics on respiratory virus epidemiology.

Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. Therefore, in this study, was discussed the role of environmental factors and conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed as well as food, water and sewage, air, insects, inanimate surfaces, and hands in COVID-19 transmission. The results of studies on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 on different levels showed that the resistance of this virus on smooth surfaces was higher than others. Temperature increase and sunlight can facilitate the destruction of SARS-COV-2 and the stability of it on surfaces. When the minimum ambient air temperature increases by 1 \u00B0C, the cumulative number of cases decreases by 0.86%. According to the latest evidence, the presence of coronavirus in the sewer has been confirmed, but there is no evidence that it is transmitted through sewage or contaminated drinking water. Also, SARS-COV-2 transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease. According to the latest studies, the possibility of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology. The results additionally show that infectious bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet.

Dendrimers are highly branched molecules that can be added to antiviral preparations to improve their delivery, as well as their intrinsic antiviral activity. Studies on identifying anti-MERS-CoV agents are few. There are three types of polyanionic dendrimers comprising the terminal groups sodium carboxylate (generations 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5), hydroxyl (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5), and succinamic acid (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5). The polycationic dendrimers containing primary amine (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5) were used to assess their antiviral activity with the MERS-CoV plaque inhibition assay. The hydroxyl polyanionic set showed a 17.36% to 29.75% decrease in MERS-CoV plaque formation. The most potent inhibition of MERS-CoV plaque formation was seen by G(1.5)-16COONa (40.5% inhibition), followed by G(5)-128SA (39.77% inhibition). In contrast, the cationic dendrimers were cytotoxic to Vero cells. Polyanionic dendrimers can be added to antiviral preparations to improve the delivery of antivirals, as well as the intrinsic antiviral activity. This article is protected by copyright.

To date, however, there is a lack of synthesis of this evidence, examining commonalities, differences, and gaps. To identify and synthesize literature on international palliative care research priorities originating from Western countries mapped to a quality assessment framework. METHODS A systematic review of several academic and grey databases were searched from January 2008-June 2019 for studies eliciting research priorities in palliative care in English. Two researchers independently reviewed, critically appraised, and conducted data extraction and synthesis. RESULTS The search yielded 10,235 articles (academic databases, n = 4108; grey literature, n = 6127), of which ten were included for appraisal and review. Priority areas were identified: service models; continuity of care; training and education; inequality; communication; living well and independently; and recognising family/carer needs and the importance of families. Methodological approaches and process of reporting varied. There was little representation of patient and caregiver driven agendas. The priorities were mapped to the Donabedian framework for assessing quality reflecting structure, process and outcomes and key priority areas. CONCLUSIONS Limited evidence exists pertaining to research priorities across palliative care. Whilst a broad range of topics were elicited, approaches and samples varied questioning the credibility of findings. The voice of the care provider dominated, calling for more inclusive means to capture the patient and family voice. The findings of this study may serve as a template to understand the commonalities of research, identify gaps, and extend the palliative care research agenda.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasson, Felicity; Nicholson, Emma; Muldrew, Deborah; Bamidele, Olufikayo; Payne, Sheila; McIlfatrick, Sonja","journal":"BMC palliative care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-020-0520-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32013949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["palliative care research agenda","international palliative care research priorities","commonalities of research","continuity of care","care provider","international research agenda","academic databases","grey databases","grey literature","gaps","family voice","CONCLUSIONS Limited evidence","quality assessment framework","key priority areas","process of reporting","Donabedian framework","systematic review","recognising family","lack of synthesis","Methodological approaches","credibility of findings","quality reflecting structure","little representation of patient","outcomes","Western countries","pertaining","training","service models","education","caregiver driven agendas","debate","carer","inequality","articles","studies","English","communication","samples","data extraction","inclusive means","METHODS","template","differences","importance of families","broad range of topics","study","researchers","appraisal","BACKGROUND","date"],"language":"en"}]}

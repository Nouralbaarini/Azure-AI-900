Virus neutralization tests are a gold standard serological diagnostic, but requirements for large volumes of serum and high biosafety containment can limit widespread use. Here, focusing on Rabies lyssavirus, a globally important zoonosis, we developed a pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (pmRFFIT) that overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we adapted an existing micro-neutralization test to use a green fluorescent protein\u2013tagged murine leukemia virus pseudotype in lieu of pathogenic rabies virus, reducing the need for specialized reagents for antigen detection and enabling use in low-containment laboratories. We further used statistical analysis to generate rapid, quantitative predictions of the probability and titer of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies from microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes. Using 47 serum samples from domestic dogs with neutralizing antibody titers estimated using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN), pmRFFIT showed moderate sensitivity (78.79%) and high specificity (84.62%). Despite small conflicts, titer predictions were correlated across tests repeated on different dates both for dog samples (r = 0.93), and for a second dataset of sera from wild common vampire bats (r = 0.72, N = 41), indicating repeatability. Our test uses a starting volume of 3.5 \u03BCL of serum, estimates titers from a single dilution of serum rather than requiring multiple dilutions and end point titration, and may be adapted to target neutralizing antibodies against alternative lyssavirus species. The pmRFFIT enables high-throughput detection of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in low-biocontainment settings and is suited to studies in wild or captive animals where large serum volumes cannot be obtained.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meza, Diana K.; Broos, Alice; Becker, Daniel J.; Behdenna, Abdelkader; Willett, Brian J.; Viana, Mafalda; Streicker, Daniel G.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b91a9633d8c9a3777c5029d8898bf8bb61f4be0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.060095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus neutralization tests","fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test","titer of rabies virus","pathogenic rabies virus","serum samples","neutralizing antibodies","high-throughput detection of rabies virus","large serum volumes","large volumes of serum","existing micro-neutralization test","\u03BCL of serum","Rabies lyssavirus","pmRFFIT","neutralizing antibody titers","murine leukemia virus pseudotype","pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test","single dilution of serum","microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes","high biosafety containment","titer predictions","high specificity","widespread use","green fluorescent protein","low-containment laboratories","antigen detection","quantitative predictions","dog samples","low-biocontainment settings","alternative lyssavirus species","wild common vampire bats","FAVN","requirements","gold standard serological diagnostic","need","captive animals","domestic dogs","probability","multiple dilutions","surveillance","studies","specialized reagents","dataset of sera","different dates","important zoonosis","core component","end point titration","starting volume","management of viral zoonoses","statistical analysis","moderate sensitivity","small conflicts","Serology","repeatability","limitations"],"language":"en"},

We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at BSWH, Temple TX. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time RT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. Results: More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED/inpatients were tested positive.

We test the hypothesis that these groups are following these recommendations and are more likely to undertake social distancing. Methods We conducted an open online survey of 4,676 U.S. adults aged 18 and older between April 4 and April 7, 2020. We model the effects of age and common COVID-19 symptoms in the last two weeks on going out of the home for non-healthcare reasons the day before taking the survey, using a logistic model and the number of close contacts (within 6 feet) that respondents had with non-household members, using a Poisson count model. Our models control for several covariates, including other flu-like symptoms, sex, education, income, whether the respondent worked in February, household size, population density in the respondents ZIP code, state fixed effects, and the day of completion of the survey. We also weight our analyses to make the sample representative of the U.S. adult population. Findings About 52 percent of the adult United States population went out of their home the previous day. On average, adults had close contact with 1.9 non-household members. We find that having at least one COVID-19 symptom (fever, dry cough, or shortness of breath) increased the likelihood of going out the previous day and having additional close contacts with non-household members; however, the estimates were not statistically significant. When disaggregating our analysis by COVID 19 symptoms, we find no strong evidence of greater social distancing by people with a fever or cough in the last two weeks, but we do find that those who experienced shortness of breath have fewer close contacts, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.30 to 0.78). Having other flu-like symptoms reduces the odds of going out by 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.60) and the incidence rate of having close contacts by 42 percent (IRR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.88). We find that older people are just as likely to leave their homes as younger people, but people over the age of 50 had less than half the predicted number of close contacts than those who were younger than 30. Our approach has the limitation that the survey sample is self-selected. Our findings may therefore be subject to selection bias that is not adequately controlled for by weighting. In addition, the possibility exists of confounding of the results due to omitted variable bias. Conclusions We provide evidence that older people are having significantly fewer close contacts than younger people, which is in line with the public health authorities recommendations. We also find that people experiencing shortness of breath are practicing more intense social distancing. However, we find that those with two other common COVID 19 symptoms, fever and dry cough, are not engaging in greater social distancing, suggesting that increased targeting on relevant symptoms, and messaging, may be required.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canning, David; Karra, Mahesh; Dayalu, Rashmi; Guo, Muqi; Bloom, David E","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92f6d110ea1f8f70161c9c0c5de8efbf1aa9abc9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20065219v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID"],"locations":["U.S.","United States"],"keyphrases":["older people","younger people","fewer close contacts","additional close contacts","predicted number of close contacts","relevant symptoms","non-household members","intense social distancing","common COVID","fever","shortness of breath","previous day","strong evidence of greater social distancing","symptoms of coronavirus disease","survey sample","household size","adult population","dry cough","day of completion","population density","non-healthcare reasons","public health authorities recommendations","adults","percent","effects of age","open online survey","IRR","logistic model","flu","Findings","weeks","adult United States population","incidence rate ratio","Poisson count model","Abstract Background Public health authorities","increased targeting","sample representative","selection bias","variable bias","respondents ZIP code","state fixed effects","results","education","income","sex","likelihood","homes","feet","risk of serious illness","possibility","confounding","Methods","messaging","limitation","estimates","average","Conclusions","covariates","groups","analyses","approach","odds","analysis","models","hypothesis","weighting"],"language":"en"},

Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages, then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid. Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses may not readily reach.

We evaluated differences in clinic and radiologic findings of multiple generations of COVID-19 infection in Xi\u0027an (Shaanxi, China) to provide more clues for the correct estimate of the disease. METHODS: All COVID-19 infected patients reported in Xi\u0027an up to 10 February 2020 were included for this analysis. Among these cases, clinical and chest CT data of 62 cases were obtained from three hospital in Xi\u0027an. With this information, patients were grouped on basis of exposure history and transmission chains as first-generation, second-generation and third-generation patients. We described clinical characteristics and evaluated CT score/patterns in these COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: There was a clear age differences in multiple generations with COVID-19 infection. Above two thirds of the second-generation (75.0%) and third-generation patients (77.8%) were aged [\u2265]45 years while 40.0% of first-generation cases at this age (p=0.001). More than half of second-generation patients (52.8%) and third-generation patients (55.6%) have comorbidities and is predominantly hypertensive (22.8% of second-generation vs. 27.8% of third-generation infections). The main exposure of second- and third-generation patients in Xi\u0027an is family exposure (35.2%). For evaluation of CT findings of pulmonary involvement, the total CT score were 4.22{\u002B/-}3.00 in first-generation group, 4.35{\u002B/-}3.03 in second-generation group and 7.62{\u002B/-}3.56 in third-generation group (p\u003C0.001). In all of three generations, the predominant pattern of abnormality observed was organizing pneumonia (65.5% in first-generation group, 61.5% in second-generation group and 71.4% in third-generation group). The average courses of the disease in third-generation infections has obviously extension (22.93{\u002B/-}7.22 days of first-generation, 21.53{\u002B/-}8.31 days of second-generation vs. 31.00{\u002B/-}8.12 days of third-generation group, p=0.004).

Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary. The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous \u0022SKII\u0022 variant. While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first.

However, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing disruptions to the global supply chains used by many diagnostic laboratories to procure the commercial kits required for RNA extraction. Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic. Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit shortages.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wozniak, Aniela; Cerda, Ariel; Ibarra-Henriquez, Catalina; Sebastian, Valentina; Armijo, Grace; Lamig, Liliana; Miranda, Carolina; Lagos, Marcela; Solari, Sandra; Guzm\u00E1n, Ana Mar\u00EDa; Quiroga, Teresa; Hitschfeld, Susan; Riveras, Eleodoro; Ferres, Marcela; Guti\u00E9rrez, Rodrigo A.; Garc\u00EDa, Patricia","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/201209b39f354dd4e585bd620be84e4876b7cca9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.083048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["commercial kits","current commercial RNA extraction kits","method","viral RNA detection","commercial kit shortages","technique RT-qPCR","crucial testing","diagnostic laboratories","pandemic","molecular biology laboratories","molecular diagnostic laboratory","early detection","common reagents","Frequent testing","essential reagents","alternative procedure","current worldwide strategy","nasopharyngeal swab samples","key pre-analytical step","individual patient management","disruptions","global supply chains","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","public health decision","developing countries","means","COVID","magnitude","Implementation"],"language":"en"},

Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess supply side preparedness in tandem with demand projections for comprehensive outlook. OBJECTIVE: Hence, we attempted this study to forecast the demand for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in demand due to COVID-19. METHODS: We employed age- structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the demand under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of mitigation strategies of a) No-lockdown b) Moderate-lockdown c) Full-lockdown. Correspondingly, data on a) General beds b) ICU beds and c) Ventilators was collated from various government records. Further, we computed the daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. FINDINGS: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in demand during peak of epidemic. Also, continuing strict lockdown measures was found to be ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly, rather would only push the peak by a month. However, augmented testing of 500,000 tests per day during peak (mid-July) under moderate lockdown scenario would lead to more reported cases (5,500,000-6,000,000), leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 10% public resources and 30% private resources would be required to commensurate with demand under that scenario. However, if the testing capacity is limited by 200,000 tests per day under same scenario, documented cases would plummet by half.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verma, V.

Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment covariance and correlation, but generalize and extend these classical bivariate measures of dependence. Distance correlation characterizes independence: it is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. The notion of covariance with respect to a stochastic process is introduced, and it is shown that population distance covariance coincides with the covariance with respect to Brownian motion; thus, both can be called Brownian distance covariance. In the bivariate case, Brownian covariance is the natural extension of product-moment covariance, as we obtain Pearson product-moment covariance by replacing the Brownian motion in the definition with identity. The corresponding statistic has an elegantly simple computing formula. Advantages of applying Brownian covariance and correlation vs the classical Pearson covariance and correlation are discussed and illustrated.","publish_time":"2010-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sz\u0027ekely, G\u0027abor J.; Rizzo, Maria L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b9deaca619aef6accc19b297d03d869b62c0250.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.0297v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Brownian covariance","Brownian distance covariance","notion of covariance","population distance covariance","Distance correlation","classical Pearson covariance","Pearson product-moment covariance","correlation vs","Brownian motion","respect","classical bivariate measures of dependence","natural extension of product","random vectors of arbitrary","bivariate case","new class of multivariate dependence coefficients applicable","simple computing formula","corresponding statistic","definition","identity","stochastic process","Advantages","equal dimension","independence"],"language":"en"},

Using the most recent report from National Records Scotland (NRS) on 29 April 2020, we examined the percentage difference in crude numbers of deaths in 2020 compared to the average for 2015-2019 by week of death within calendar year. To determine if trends were similar, suggesting underreporting/underdiagnosed COVID-19 related deaths, we also looked at the trends in % differences for cardiovascular disease deaths. From the first 17 weeks\u0027 of data, we found a peak in excess deaths between weeks 14 of 2020, about four weeks after the first case in Scotland was detected on 1 March 2020-- but by week 17 these excesses had diminished around the time lockdown in the UK began. Similar observations were seen for cardiovascular disease-related deaths. These observations suggest that the short-term increase in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths might be associated with undetected/unconfirmed deaths related to COVID-19. Both of these conditions make patients more susceptible to infection and lack of widespread access to testing for COVID-19 are likely to have resulted in under-estimation of COVID-19 mortality. These data further suggest that the cumulative toll of COVID-19 on mortality is likely undercounted. More detailed analysis is needed to determine if these excesses were directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. Disease specific mortality will need constant monitoring for the foreseeable future as changes occur in increasing capacity and access to testing, reporting criteria, changes to health services and different measures are implemented to control the spread of the COVID-19.

Design: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real-time analysis, using a pre-approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO. Setting: 166 UK hospitals between 6th February and 18th April 2020. Participants: 16,749 people with COVID-19. Interventions: No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co-enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials. Results: The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1,8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4,12]. The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19%) and asthma (14%); 47% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49% of patients were discharged alive, 33% have died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31% were discharged alive, 45% died and 24% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20% were discharged alive, 53% died and 27% remained in hospital.

Design: This study is a case-control study. We had tried to apply a new blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction to the students before the outbreak and then universities responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by closing campuses and shifting to other forms of distance learning. In other word, the courses started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Five Point Likert Scale Questionnaires which contains 20 items were used, and the effect of the two kinds of teaching patterns was compared by evaluating the indicators of core competencies of students including professionalism, attitude towards learning, knowledge and learning skills, teamwork skills, motivation in learning, adaptability and acceptance of the courses and network environment. Setting: Our study based on a single center. Participants: Fifty fourth-year medical students receiving the 5\u002B3 pattern courses regarding internal medicine were enrolled in the study. Exposure(s) :The teaching and learning patter started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Main Outcome: According to the descriptive statistical analysis of the first part of the questionnaire (question 1-16), the average score of adaptability and acceptance of the courses is 2.60 lower than 3, indicating that students are more adapted to other forms of distance learning during COVID-19 outbreak; the average score of the rest of the questions is higher than 3, indicating that blended teaching model based on 5G network is superior to other forms of distance learning. The number of male students who are inclined to the blended teaching model based on 5G network is 0.13 times as much as that of female students (95%CI:0.028~0.602, p=0.009). Results: Online forms of distance learning were accepted by the students. Female students had higher expectations on the course and were more likely to adapt well to the change during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, all students preferred the blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction before the pandemic. Conclusion: It indicates that medical education based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction is a more suitable option to teach medical students online.

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the world\u0027s worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was accomplished in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in areas of high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data.

People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to infection and severe disease. Health and housing authorities in England have developed a residential intervention that aims to isolate those vulnerable to severe disease (COVID-PROTECT) and care for people with symptoms (COVID CARE). Methods: We used a discrete-time Markov chain model to forecast COVID-19 infections among people experiencing homelessness, given strong containment measures in the general population and some transmission among 35,817 people living in 1,065 hostels, and 11,748 people sleeping rough (the \u0027do nothing\u0027 scenario). We then estimated demand for beds if those eligible are offered COVID-PROTECT and COVID-CARE. We estimated the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospital admissions that could be achieved by these interventions. We also conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses to identify programme success factors. Results: In a \u0027do nothing\u0027 scenario, we estimate that 34% of the homeless population could get COVID-19 between March and August 2020, with 364 deaths, 4,074 hospital admissions and 572 critical care admissions. In our \u0027base intervention\u0027 scenario, demand for COVID-PROTECT peaks at 9,934 beds, and demand for COVID-CARE peaks at 1,366 beds. The intervention could reduce transmission by removing symptomatic individuals from the community, and preventing vulnerable individuals from being infected. This could lead to a reduction of 164 deaths, 2,624 hospital admissions, and 248 critical care admissions over this period. Sensitivity analyses showed that the number of deaths is sensitive to transmission of COVID-19 in COVID-PROTECT. If COVID-PROTECT capacity is limited, scenario analyses show the benefit of prioritising people who are vulnerable to severe disease. Conclusion: Supportive accommodation can mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the homeless population of England, and reduce the burden on acute hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewer, D.; Braithwaite, I.; Bullock, M.; Eyre, M.

Understanding of host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction in viral pathogenesis is still in its infancy. In this study we aimed to correlate how SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its proteins for tackling the host immune response; parallelly, how host epigenetic factors might play a role in this pathogenesis was also investigated. We have utilized a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to elucidate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2. Integrating the experimentally validated host interactome proteins and differentially expressed host genes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have taken a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to delineate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2 in various signaling pathways. Also, we have shown how host epigenetic factors are involved in the deregulation of gene expression. Strikingly, we have found that several transcription factors and other epigenetic factors can modulate some immune signaling pathways, helping both host and virus. We have identified miRNA hsa-miR-429 whose transcription factor was also upregulated and targets were downregulated and this miRNA can have pivotal role in suppression of host immune responses. While searching for the pathways in which viral proteins interact with host proteins, we have found pathways like-HIF-1 signaling, autophagy, RIG-I signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, Fatty acid oxidation/degradation, Il-17 signaling etc significantly associated. We observed that these pathways can be either hijacked or suppressed by the viral proteins, leading to the improved viral survival and life-cycle. Moreover, pathways like-Relaxin signaling in lungs suggests aberration by the viral proteins might lead to the lung pathophysiology found in COVID-19. Also, enrichment analyses suggest that deregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in heart development, kidney development, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications etc. might suggest why patients with comorbidities are becoming more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 integrates its proteins in different immune signaling pathway and other cellular signaling pathways for developing efficient immune evasion mechanisms, while leading the host to more complicated disease condition.

Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saha, Priyanka; Banerjee, Arup Kumar; Tripathi, Prem Prakash; Srivastava, Amit Kumar; Ray, Upasana","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029132","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","India"],"keyphrases":["Indian isolates","SARS-CoV","spike protein","sequences of Wuhan isolates","clinical isolates","MERS-CoV","hydrophobic amino acid","Receptor binding domain","receptor ding","virus entry","genome sequences","sequence analyses","novel coronavirus","recent outbreak of SARS","C-beta","beta coronaviruses","key role","ACE2","information","rational drug","scientists","detailed study","isoleucine","structural proteins","point mutations","sequencing","therapeutic targeting","RBD","world","zoonotic outbreaks","vaccine engineering","validation","position","course","various databases","region","secondary structure","site arginine","finding","COVID","nCoV2019","China","GenBank"],"language":"en"},

Further, there remain countries in the early phase of outbreak with zero or limited number of cases in southern hemisphere countries. In those countries at risk of future outbreak, ascertaining whether cases are imported or the result of local secondary transmission is important for government to shape appropriate public health strategies. Objective: To develop a method to estimate timing of infection establishment, which helps differentiate imported and autochthonous cases. Design, Setting and Participants: Of the first 18 cases reported in Singapore, 12 were used in our study (1 case with insufficient data and 5 on anti-viral treatment were excluded from the analysis). The viral load data from these initial cases considered imported due to their travel history to Wuhan were analyzed. Another viral load data from 3 cases reported from Zhuhai, China, for whom exposed day were known, were also analyzed to determine the viral load threshold for infection establishment. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test. Main Outcomes and Measures: The timing of infection establishment of each case was assessed by analysing viral load data after symptom onset using a within-host viral dynamics model for SARS-CoV-2. Estimated timing of infection will indicate whether cases are imported or autochthonous transmission within Singapore. Results: Six among the 12 cases were clearly imported cases, whereas we could not rule out the possibility of secondary transmission for the rest of 6 cases, which collectively evidenced ongoing transmission in Singapore. For the 6 cases who could be the results of secondary transmission, further investigation to identify the source of infection within Singapore should be warranted (i.e., contact tracing). Conclusions and Relevance: In an early phase of outbreak due to entrance or re-entrance of the virus to countries/communities, collecting viral load data over time from cases from symptom onset is highly recommended, because viral load data are valuable to infer the timing of infection and distinguish between imported cases and ongoing local transmission.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ejima, Keisuke; Kim, Kwang Su; Ito, Yusuke; Iwanami, Shoya; Ohashi, Hirofumi; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Watashi, Koichi; Bento, Ana I; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Iwami, Shingo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6080016ea787cbc71c646fd54126fb2f36e3aa41.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20040519","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Singapore"],"locations":["China","Zhuhai"],"keyphrases":["imported cases","autochthonous cases","initial cases","viral load data","viral load threshold","limited number of cases","timing of infection establishment","Estimated timing of infection","ongoing transmission","source of infection","autochthonous transmission","Singapore","results of secondary transmission","insufficient data","anti-viral treatment","ongoing local transmission","possibility of secondary transmission","result of local secondary transmission","host viral dynamics model","early phase of outbreak","southern hemisphere countries","symptom onset","SARS-CoV","China","risk of future outbreak","government","time","outbreaks","containment","Measures","investigation","communities","appropriate public health strategies","polymerase-chain","reaction","PCR","disease","large effort","virus","re-entrance","method","rest","travel history","huge susceptible population","test","Main Outcomes","COVID","Relevance","epidemic","study","Zhuhai","Wuhan","Conclusions","Exposures","analysis","Participants","Design","Importance","Objective","day","tracing"],"language":"en"},

Aiming at screening for secondary pneumonia, we collected the data of our first twelve ICU patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Surprisingly, four were detected with Pneumocystis jirovecii (Pj) DNA and RNA, resulting in Pj prevalence of 17%. Pj is a ubiquitous ascomycetes fungus that thrives at the surface of type-I pneumocytes, specifically in human alveoli, leading to pneumocystosis in immunocompromised patients. Interestingly, none of our patients was immunocompromised per se before admission, while all presented the recognized risk factors for life-threatening COVID-19 infection. Observing such high prevalence in COVID-infected patients was unexpected. Almost all patients developed ARDS and received high-dose steroids to prevent worsening, as suggested by reports from China. In Pj-positive patients requiring steroids, prophylaxis was given to avoid the risk of pneumocystosis and increased lung inflammation that may compromise the outcome. We are strongly convinced that testing deep lung specimens for Pj in severe COVID-19 patients should be recommended and Pj-positive patients treated with steroids, and given anti-Pj prophylaxis. This message is important, given the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients in the ICU.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alanio, A.; Voicu, S.; Delliere, s.; Megarbane, B.; Bretagne, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e3d92367e7223cd85446f55e953520b270e3c94.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.20105296v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumocystis"],"organizations":["ICU","ARDS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","Pj-positive patients","immunocompromised patients","COVID-infected patients","Pj prevalence","anti-Pj prophylaxis","severe COVID","life-threatening COVID","high mortality rate of COVID","high prevalence","high-dose steroids","risk of pneumocystosis","recognized risk factors","increased lung inflammation","deep lung specimens","DNA","RNA","worsening","admission","data","bronchoalveolar lavage","ARDS","ubiquitous ascomycetes fungus","Pneumocystis jirovecii","secondary pneumonia","infection","BAL","frightening increase","human alveoli","reports","screening","surface of type","outcome","message","China"],"language":"en"},

More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them one of the critical approach which is treated as radiology imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this article, we have introduced a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%.

Specifically, we assess how vaccination intentions are influenced by the presence of people who cannot vaccinate, such as the immunosuppressed, newborns or pregnant women, using a game where there is a passive player whose welfare depends on the decisions of other, active players. Results from a survey experiment targeting parents and from a laboratory experiment provide support for a twofold positive effect of the presence of the passive player on vaccination intentions. These findings suggest messages that invoke altruistic, other-regarding preferences may be an effective approach to increasing vaccination intentions. Our findings could be extended to other campaigns where the population is invited to adopt behaviors that can help the most susceptible people, as is the case of the self-quarantine measures adopted during the outbreak of CoVID-19 at the beginning of 2020.

Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhan, Shing Hei; Deverman, Benjamin E.; Chan, Yujia Alina","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43f54ba1037a7c771b86d300e993ced4bbc86248.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human SARS-CoV","human-adapted SARS-CoV","infectious SARS-CoV","time SARS-CoV","late epidemic SARS-CoV","SARS outbreaks","human transmission","existing pools of SARS","human sources","market samples","late phase","environmental samples","progenitor virus","Wuhan Huanan seafood market","extent similar","lingering population","concern","recent key findings","intermediate hosts","stronger international efforts","advantageous adaptations","isolates","major cause","comparison of evolutionary dynamics","sudden appearance","progenitors","branches of evolution","precursors","future re-emergence","clues","observations","effective approaches"],"language":"en"},

Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China\u0027s most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province\u0027s large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures.

This vaccination strategy specifically targets unique vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the human population.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yarmarkovich, Mark; Warrington, John M.; Farrel, Alvin; Maris, John M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae830c6fd724b25b149e399c53106fdb67d6a95a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.018978","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vast majority","SARS-CoV","vaccination strategy","human population","divergent regions","human proteome","conserved regions","peptide sequences","unique vulnerabilities of SARS","synthetic peptide constructs","B cell epitopes","novel furin cleavage site","infectivity","ACE2 receptor","robust adaptive immune response","increased binding","spike protein","mRNA","membrane fusion","adaptations","virus","DNA","identification","MHC class","effective vaccine"],"language":"en"},

However, few researches focused on the clinical features of death patients. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and mortal causes in Chinese COVID-19 death patients. Patients and methods: The clinical characteristics of death patients were collected from publicized by local health authorities in China. Expressions of virus targets in human organs were obtained from GTEx database. Results: 159 patients from 24 provinces in China were recruited in our study, including 26 young patients under 60 and 133 aged 60 or older. The median age was 71 years, which indicated that most death patients were elderly. More male patients died of COVID-19 than females (1.65 fold). Hypertension was the most common coexisting disorder and respiratory failure was the most common direct cause of death. Fever (71.19%) and cough (55.08%) were the predominant presenting symptoms. There was one asymptomatic patient. In addition, by comparing young and old patients, heart disease was identified as an important risk factor for death in the aged patients. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were the targets of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed their expression in different organs. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 had a high expression in the organs which had corresponding clinical features in death patients. Conclusion: Male, age and heart disease were the main risk factors of death. Beside, asymptomatic patients with serious coexisting disorders may also die of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, more attention should be paid to the old patients with heart disease and asymptomatic patients in the treatment .

One of them is the contribution to transmission from individuals experiencing asymptomatic infections. We aimed to characterise the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic infections using data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Methods: We used a transmission model of COVID-19 with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states calibrated to outbreak data from the Diamond Princess, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. Data available included the date of symptom onset for symptomatic disease for passengers and crew, the number of symptom agnostic tests done each day, and date of positive test for asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Findings: On the Diamond Princess 74% (70-78%) of infections proceeded asymptomatically, i.e. a 1:3.8 case-to-infection ratio. Despite the intense testing 53%, (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. While the data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, assuming no or low infectiousness resulted in posterior estimates for the net reproduction number of an individual progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages in excess of 15. Interpretation: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute substantially to transmission.

In our in vitro experiments, which were severely curtailed by prevailing circumstances, we used water as a substitute on the blood side. The water was saturated rapidly indicating that the system was flow limited rather than diffusion limited for oxygen transfer. Using these findings, we estimated the expected performance with blood and the results suggest that two dialysis units operating in parallel with a pure oxygen gas supply running counter-current to the blood flow, could supply up to 40% of the total required oxygen demand rate in an adult patient. While not studied, carbon dioxide elimination is likely to be feasible as well. It is thus possible that hollow fiber dialysis units operating with suitable roller pumps in a veno-venous access configuration, could serve as a cost-effective and readily available alternative or adjunct for respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints. Verification and extension of our study is needed by well resourced laboratories who are still able to function during this unprecedented period of restrictions.

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. METHODS\uFF1AWe established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients. CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Lianhua; Zhou, Junbo; Niu, Chunyan; Wang, Quanyi; Pan, Yang; Sheng, Sitong; Wang, Xia; Zhang, Yongzhuo; Yang, Jiayi; Liu, Manqing; Zhao, Yang; Zhang, Xiaoying; Zhu, Tao; Peng, Tao; Xie, Jie; Gao, Yunhua; Wang, Di; Zhao, Yun; Dai, Xinhua; Fang, Xiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98ba0f8fa9ece84d4a025c70d9de89bb5f3e738e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-qPCR","RT-dPCR assays","diagnostic accuracy of RT","positive rate of RT","fever suspected patients","sensitivity of SARS","elderly patients","termed SARS-CoV","reverse transcription quantitative qPCR","qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples","diagnostics of SARS","clinical pharyngeal swab samples","close contacts","reaction","copies","sensitive methods","limit of detection","low viral load specimens","reverse transcription digital PCR","overall sensitivity","supposed convalescents","suspect rate","limit of blanks","clinical symptoms","alternative diagnostic approach","longer observation period","ORF","specificity","confirmatory method","protocol","novel Coronavirus","quantification","hospital","LoD","gold standard","LoBs","E genes","addition","isolation","quality assurance","outbreak of COVID","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","countries","world"],"language":"en"},

Serologic tests based on ELISA have been developed and evaluated as useful complements to PCR in these situations. However, there is scarce information about the usefulness of rapid tests based on immunochromatography. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of these rapid tests in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COV-19 IgG / IgM kit) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. First, we performed a validation of the serologic test using serum samples from 45 healthy control patients (group 1) and 55 confirmed by PCR cases of COVID-19 (group 2) in order to establish the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Then we prospectively employed the test in 63 patients diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology that were SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR (group 3), to establish the diagnostic performance in these patients. Results: All patients from group 1 (healthy controls) resulted negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100%). Regarding group 2 (PCR positive) patients, the median time from the onset of symptoms was 11 days and the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 26 out of 55 patients (overall sensitivity = 47.3%). However, in those patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 73.9%.

In these group 3 patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the positivity rate was 91.1%. Conclusions: Our study shows that serologic rapid tests can be used as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms. These immunochromatographic devices could be especially useful in hospitalized patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology with 14 or more days from the onset of symptoms and in whom the PCR has been negative.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia, Felipe Perez; Perez Tanoira, Ramon; Romanyk Cabrera, Juan Pedro; Arroyo Serrano, Teresa; Gomez Herruz, Pe\u00F1a; Cuadros Gonzalez, Juan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e9a14f52eb510e67b97ac68b6649a1a2eac3f22.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062158","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia patients","hospitalized patients","onset of symptoms","group","healthy control patients","PCR positive","median days","Serologic tests","immunochromatographic test","complement of PCR","serologic rapid tests","SARS-CoV","PCR cases of COVID","IgG","negative","usefulness of rapid tests","AllTest COV","diagnostic performance","pneumonia of unknown etiology","low positivity rate","infection","IgM kit","study","IgM antibodies","diagnostic challenge","specificity","overall sensitivity","serum samples","median time","healthy controls","useful complements","immunochromatographic devices","upper respiratory samples","scarce information","immunochromatography","situations","validation","order","weeks","Conclusions","Methods","Objectives","ELISA","Results","aim"],"language":"en"},

Fast identification of virus\u2013host interactions can reveal mechanistic insights of infectious diseases and shed light on potential treatments and drug discoveries.

In the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment, cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies are urgently needed. Methods: Here, we have used RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples collected during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the Region of Valencia, Spain. Results: We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases.

Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randazzo, Walter; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Sanjuan, Rafael; Domingo-Calap, Pilar; Sanchez, Gloria","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f267fa1ef3a65e239aa974329e935a4d93dafd2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076679v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies","surveillance tool","COVID","Results","wastewater viral RNA context","cost-effective strategy","viral outbreaks","wastewater analysis","Region of Valencia","number of declared cases","series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples","efficient treatment","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","disease","earliest stages","vaccine","preparedness","detection","subsequent ascent","epidemic","extreme containment measures","emerging pandemic","absence","Routine implementation","RT-qPCR","community transmission","Spain","Background","Interpretation","Methods"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Lin; Wu, Shanshan; Hao, Xiaowen; Li, Xuelong; Liu, Xiyang; Ye, Shenglong; Han, Heng; Dong, Xue; Li, Xin; Li, Jiyao; Liu, Jianmin; Liu, Na; Zhang, Wanzhong; Pelechano, Vicent; Chen, Wei-Hua; Yin, Xiushan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025874","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["method-iLACO","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","nCoV virus","new developed method","qPCR detection method","severe respiratory disease","isothermal LAMP","similar coronaviruses","iLACO assays","loading of virus","COVID","press time","Reaction time","nCoV threat control","severe acute respiratory syndrome","influenza viruses","related viruses","human pathogen","normal coronaviruses","infected individuals","infected people","cases","fever","synthesized RNA equivalent","order","specialized molecular biology equipment","onsite diagnosis methods","Taqman","sequences","versatility","BLAST","copies","pneumonia","global health","serious cause","simplicity","recent outbreak","ORF1ab gene","concern","sensitivity","collected samples","symptoms","species-specificity","fragment","primers","accuracy","minutes","years","transmissibility"],"language":"en"},

We assessed how the type and timing of public- health interventions impacted the course of the outbreak in Alberta and other Canadian provinces. Methods: We used publicly-available data to summarize rates of laboratory data and mortality in relation to measures implemented to contain the outbreak and testing strategy. We estimated the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 before the state of emergency declaration for each province (R0) and at the study end date (Rt). Results: The first cases were confirmed in Ontario (January 25) and British Columbia (January 28). All provinces implemented the same health-policy measures between March 12 and March 30. Alberta had a higher percentage of the population tested (3.8%) and a lower mortality rate (3/100,000) than Ontario (2.6%; 11/100,000) or Quebec (3.1%; 31/100,000). British Columbia tested fewer people (1.7%) and had similar mortality as Alberta. Data on provincial testing strategies were insufficient to inform further analyses. Mortality rates increased with increasing rates of lab- confirmed cases in Ontario and Quebec, but not in Alberta. R0 was similar across all provinces, but varied widely from 2.6 (95% confidence intervals 1.9-3.4) to 6.4 (4.3-8.5), depending on the assumed time interval between onset of symptoms in a primary and a secondary case (serial interval). The outbreak is currently under control in Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia (Rt \u003C1). Interpretation: COVID-19-related health outcomes varied by province despite rapid implementation of similar health-policy interventions across Canada. Insufficient information about provincial testing strategies and a lack of primary data on serial interval are major limitations of existing data on the Canadian COVID-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahsin, M.; Lee, S.; Vickers, D.; Guigue, A.; Williamson, T.; Quan, H.; Quinn, R.

Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals\u2019 publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review. For articles not related to Covid-19, no acceleration of the publication process is found.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged \u226530 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age\u003E70 years and 6.3% aged \u226470 years with \u22651 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of \u22652 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age\u003E70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with \u22653 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Amitava; Pasea, Laura; Harris, Steve; Gonzalez-Izquierdo, Arturo; Torralbo, Ana; Shallcross, Laura; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Pillay, Deenan; Pagel, Christina; Wong, Wai Keong; Langenberg, Claudia; Williams, Bryan; Denaxas, Spiros; Hemingway, Harry","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b7eb331a01bd30355e381342396524f7ba5c786.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040287","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAPID","NHS","COVID","UK Public Health England","PHE","COPD","SARS","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["excess mortality","mortality risk","year mortality","background mortality","relative mortality impact of COVID","excess number of deaths","number of excess deaths","overall population mortality","numbers of excess deaths","minimal excess deaths","UK population","simple models of excess COVID","Estimating excess","Previous models of population mortality","high risk conditions","relative impact of COVID","different COVID","background risk","relative risk","prevalence of underlying conditions","pre-COVID","differing mortality impacts","UK Public Health England COVID","established winter vs summer mortality excess","related deaths","at-risk population","highest risk","years","SARS CoV2 rates","emergency","health service","adults Background","incidence rates","economic impact","suppression scenario","NHS health records","HDR UK - CALIBER","longer term background","chronic kidney disease","cardiovascular disease","COPD","mitigation","secondary care electronic health records","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","stringent suppression measures","rapid analysis","unknown effects","RAPID COMMUNICATION","different ages","infected people","current PHE guidelines","linked primary","researchers","policy makers","efforts","incorporated information","similar magnitude","need","diagnosis","days","range of preventive interventions","procedure","Methods","do-nothing","medication codes","validated phenotypes","steroid therapy","severe obesity","diabetes","ICD","Multimorbidity","co-occurrence","scenarios","results","Interpretation","individuals","Findings"],"language":"en"},

Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID-19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS-CoV-1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub- Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Araujo, Miguel B.; Naimi, Babak","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/227002d1833cfefb0e75033df14a87c7ca8f4d16.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Latin America","South East Asia"],"keyphrases":["spread of SARS CoV","models of epidemic spread","predecessor SARS-CoV","virus","human transmission of SARS","human demography","cold climates","climate suitability","tropical climates","unsuitable climates","ecological niche models","similar climate conditions","new cases of COVID","asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks","Latin America","sub- Saharan Africa","monthly variation","mobility","current trends","South East Asia","pattern of clustering","predictors","dry areas","ensemble","typical climatological year","factors","data","local transmissions","understanding","model uncertainties","pressure","world","disease","capacity","environment"],"language":"en"},

While developed countries such as the USA, Italy, England, France, Spain, and Germany struggle to mitigate the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Latin America, India, and Africa -territories in which the mounted infrastructure for diagnosis is greatly underdeveloped. An actual epidemic emergency does not provide the required timeframe for testing new diagnostic strategies; therefore, the first line of response must be based on commercially and readily available resources. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubation chamber for commercial Eppendorf PCR tubes, and a colorimetric embodiment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used this strategy to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using a set of in-house designed initiators that target regions encoding the N protein. We were able to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2 X 105 DNA copies by this straightforward method. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for use during the COVID-19 pandemics, particularly in underdeveloped regions were the availability of RT-qPCR instruments may be limited. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of this strategy make it a reliable alternative for deployment of point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during the pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Everardo; Lara-Mayorga, Itzel Montserrat; Garcia-Rubio, Andres; Garciamendez-Mijares, Carlos Ezio; Guerra-Alvarez, Gilberto Emilio; Garcia-Martinez, German; Aguayo-Hernandez, Juan Andres; Zhang, Yu-Shrike; Martinez-Chapa, Sergio Omar; Trujillo-de Santiago, Grissel; Alvarez, Mario Moises","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058651","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","France","Germany","Latin America","India"],"keyphrases":["care SARS-CoV","detection of SARS","propagation of SARS","reliable alternative","ease of use","combined use","diagnostics strategy","nucleic acids","underdeveloped regions","pandemics","positive cases of COVID","DNA sequences","detection efforts","DNA copies","commercial Eppendorf PCR tubes","printed incubation chamber","LAMP","reaction scheme","required timeframe","isothermal amplification","set of in-house designed initiators","Italy","France","India","loop","colorimetric embodiment","availability of RT","Africa -territories","Latin America","deployment of point","new diagnostic strategies","USA","Spain","England","mounted infrastructure","actual epidemic emergency","Germany","qPCR instruments","straightforward method","accuracy","simplicity","reproducibility","N protein","diagnosis","countries","portability","range","line of response","available resources","week","deaths"],"language":"en"},

In this paper we describe and present the results obtained by one of the modeling approaches developed within the BMTF, a stochastic SHARUCD-type models able to describe the disease incidence data, provided by the Basque Health Service, with a single parameter set.

The growth rate {lambda} is calculated from the model and from the data and the implications for the reproduction ratio r are shown. At the moment, the reproduction ratio r is estimated to be below the threshold behavior of r = 1, but still close to 1, meaning that although the number of new cases are decelerating, a careful monitoring of the development of the outbreak is required. Besides projections on the national health system needs during the increased population demand on hospital admissions, models were able to describe COVID-19 epidemic in the Basque Country, from introduction to control measure response and are now being used to monitor disease transmission when the country lockdown is gradually lifted.

We propose a model that couples epidemic spreading and resource diffusion in multiplex networks. The spread of disease in a physical contact layer and the recovery of the infected nodes are both strongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social layer. The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in turn strongly dependent upon the state of the nodes in the physical contact layer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly in this model. To quantify the degree of preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls the resource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that the preferential resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the fraction of infected nodes. When the degree of interlayer correlation is below a critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes the phase transition from double continuous to single continuous. When the degree of interlayer correlation is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from multiple continuous to first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find hysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also find that there is an optimal resource strategy at each fixed degree of interlayer correlation where the threshold reaches a maximum and under which the disease can be maximally suppressed. In addition, the optimal controlling parameter increases as the degree of inter-layer correlation increases.","publish_time":"2018-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaolong; Wang, Wei; Cai, Shimin; Stanley, H.

SUMMARY Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luong-Nguyen, Minh; Hermand, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Abdalla, Solafah; Cabrit, Nicolas; Hobeika, Christian; Brouquet, Antoine; Go\u00E9r\u00E9, Diane; Sauvanet, Alain","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd6d0134533e6f16c1af6e275fa99fba40179861.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878786X20301005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878786X20301005?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients hospitalized","hospital patients","patients admis","the patients who developed","to protect uninfected patients","patients admitted to digestive surgery services","The COVID","infection was","infection nosocomiale","s\u00E9rie de patients hospitalis\u00E9s","afflux de patients hospitalis\u00E9s","the follow","The aim","The reasons","The clinical","patients had co","infection during hospitalization","patients were discharged post","to April","the diagnosis was","hospitalisation","two patients had died","developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS","hospitalization were","At the end","services de chirurgie digestive","The median time from admission to diagnosis","drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx","intervention de chirurgie digestive","necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity","digestive surgery services who developed","following digestive surgery is","days","jours","little is known about the risk","this work was to report","complications linked to cancer or its treatment","were collected from the computerized medical record","seven were hospitalized with two","This is","surgical treatment","avoiding hospitalization","risque r\u00E9el","potentially serious risk","There were nine men","From March","diagnostic","traitement de complications li\u00E9es","activit\u00E9 chirurgicale","traitement chirurgical","years","Conclusions","ans","hospital stay","respiratory assistance","assistance respiratoire","its consequences","median age","RESUME Introduction","SUMMARY Introduction","\u00E2ge m\u00E9dian","d\u00E9lai m\u00E9dian","series","interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments","pandemic imposed","women","after","them","real","radiological","among","sein","more than","However","Measures","biological","Etude r\u00E9trospective","reprise","suites","donn\u00E9es cliniques","diminution radicale","M\u00E9thodes","femmes","pand\u00E9mie","perspective","dur\u00E9e","motifs","morbidities","virus","issue du suivi","dossiers informatis\u00E9s","travail","Results","s\u00E9curit\u00E9","cons\u00E9quences","Methods","urgences complexes","reconstruction","gastroplastie","fermeture de stomie","complex emergencies","stoma closure","but","mesures","hommes","comorbidit\u00E9","R\u00E9sultats","gastroplasty"],"language":"fr"},

There is a critical need for complementary surveillance approaches that can function at population-scale to inform public health decisions in real-time. Internet search patterns provide a number of important advantages relative to laboratory testing. We conducted a detailed global study of Internet search patterns related to COVID-19 symptoms in multiple languages across 32 countries on six continents. We found that Internet search patterns reveal a robust temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills are followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days [95% CI 3.30-7.14] after symptom onset, matching the precise clinical course reported in the medical literature. Furthermore, we found that increases in COVID-19-symptom-related searches predict increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths 18.53 days [95% CI 15.98-21.08] and 22.16 days [95% CI 20.33-23.99] in advance, respectively. This is the first study to show that Internet search patterns can be used to reveal the detailed clinical course of a disease.

We have reported that mice treated with a combination of inhaled Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/6 and TLR 9 agonists (Pam2-ODN) to stimulate innate immunity are broadly protected against respiratory pathogens, but the mechanisms underlying this protection remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we show in a lethal paramyxovirus model that Pam2-ODN-enhanced survival is associated with robust virus inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which occurs prior to internalization by lung epithelial cells. However, we also found that mortality in sham-treated mice temporally corresponded with CD8\u002B T cell-enriched lung inflammation that peaks on days 11-12 after viral challenge, when the viral burden has waned to a scarcely detectable level. Pam2-ODN treatment blocked this injurious inflammation by reducing the viral burden, and alternatively, depleting CD8\u002B T cells 8 days after viral challenge also decreased mortality.

Many attempts have been devoted to modeling the dynamics of new infection rates, death rates, and the impact of the disease on health systems and the world economy. Most of these modeling concepts use the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental models; however, wide imprecise outcomes in forecasting can occur with these models in the context of poor data, low testing levels, and a nonhomogeneous population. Objectives: To predict Brazilian ICU beds demand over time and during COVID-19 pandemic peak. Methods: In the present study, we describe a Bayesian COVID-19 model combined with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to forecast quantitative predictions of infections, number of deaths and the demand for critical care beds in the next month in the Brazilian context of scarce data availability. We also estimated COVID-19 spread tendency in the state of Sao Paulo and forecasted the demand for critical care beds, as Sao Paulo is the epicenter of the Latin America pandemic. Results: Our model estimated that the number of infected individuals would be approximately 6.5 million (median) on April 25, 2020, and would reach 16 to 17 million (median) by the end of August 2020 in Brazil. The probability that an infected individual requires ICU-level care in Brazil is 0.5833% . Our model suggests that the current level of mitigation seen in Sao Paulo is sufficient to reach Rt \u003C 1, thus attaining a peak in the short term. In Sao Paulo state, the total number of deaths is estimated to be around 9,000 (median) with the 2.5% quantile being 6,600 deaths and the 97.5% quantile being around 13,350 deaths. Also, Sao Paulo will not attain its maximum capacity of ICU beds if the current trend persists over the long term. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic should peak in Brazil between May 8 and May 20, 2020 with a fatality rate lower than that suggested in the literature. The northern and northeastern regions of Brazil will suffer from a lack of available ICU beds, whereas the southeastern, southern, and central-western regions appear to have sufficient ICU beds only if they share private system beds with the publicly funded Unified Heath System (SUS). The model predicts that, if the current policies and population behavior are maintained throughout the forecasted period, by the end of August 2020, Brazil will have around 12% of its population immune to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dana, S.; Simas, A.

Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States. Design: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data. Data sources: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. Main outcome measures: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state issuance of the stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 \u03BCg/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%, 15%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xiao; Nethery, Rachel C.; Sabath, Benjamin M.; Braun, Danielle; Dominici, Francesca","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9aa462d97c0fda4cd26f4804a3c5a9825870eb26.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["county-level COVID","long-term exposure","increased risk of COVID","risk of death","death rate","long-term average exposure","county-level long-term average of PM2","county-level data","death counts","small increase","large increase","Results","time","population size","population density","state issuance","United States government scientists","Data sources","additional sensitivity analyses","counties","ecological study design","Main outcome measures","cross-sectional study","existing air pollution regulations","potential correlation","main analysis","potential confounding factors","Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center","Systems Science","age distribution","negative binomial mixed models","stay-at-home order","fine particulate matter","number of individuals","hospital beds","behavioral variables","weather","human health","outbreak","beginning","Johns Hopkins University","deaths","obesity","inherent limitations","confidence interval","Objectives","importance","smoking","code","\u03BCg","m3","Conclusions","diseases","tens of thousands","random intercept","pre-existing conditions","Americans","crisis"],"language":"en"},

In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate determinants of the prognosis of the disease in 70 patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia (i.e. requiring at least 3 liters of oxygen) hospitalized between 10 March and 9 April, 2020, in the Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman, France. The main outcome was oro-tracheal intubation and the exposure of interest was corticotherapy. Since this was not a randomized trial, we used propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effect. Results. There was evidence that corticotherapy lowered the risk of intubation with a risk difference of -47.1% (95% confidence interval -71.8% to -22.5%). Conclusion. Corticosteroid, a well-known, easily available, and cheap treatment, could be an important tool in management of severe COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy\u0027s current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases.

We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared. Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06 \u00B1 0.28 vs. 5.29 \u00B1 0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P\u003C0.001).

COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. In order to launch both containment and mitigation measures, each country requires accurate estimates of COVID-19 incidence as such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and design control strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory COVID-19. We have analyzed incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America, and India, and show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country with high accuracy. We show that R0 as the basic reproduction number exhibits significant spatial and temporal variation in these countries. However, by including a new function for temporal variation of R0 in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides highly reliable estimates of asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19 patients, both of which are key players in COVID-19 transmission. Our dynamic modeling approach can be applied widely and will provide a new fillip to infectious disease management strategies worldwide.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ravinder, R.; Singh, Sourabh; Bishnoi, Suresh; Jan, Amreen; Sinha, Abhinav; Sharma, Amit; Kodamana, Hariprasad; Krishnan, N.

Anammox bacteria convert ammonium (NH4\u002B) to dinitrogen gas (N2) using nitrite (NO2\u2212) or nitric oxide (NO) as the electron acceptor. In the absence of NO2\u2212 or NO, anammox bacteria can couple formate oxidation to the reduction of metal oxides such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV). Their genomes contain homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella cytochromes involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET). However, it is still unknown whether anammox bacteria have EET capability and can couple the oxidation of NH4\u002B with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors. Here we show using complementary approaches that in the absence of NO2\u2212, freshwater and marine anammox bacteria couple the oxidation of NH4\u002B with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors such as graphene oxide (GO) or electrodes poised at a certain potential in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Metagenomics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization and electrochemical analyses coupled with MEC performance confirmed that anammox electrode biofilms were responsible for current generation through EET-dependent oxidation of NH4\u002B. 15N-labelling experiments revealed the molecular mechanism of the EET-dependent anammox process. NH4\u002B was oxidized to N2 via hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as intermediate when electrode was the terminal electron acceptor. Comparative transcriptomics analysis supported isotope labelling experiments and revealed an alternative pathway for NH4\u002B oxidation coupled to EET when electrode is used as electron acceptor compared to NO2\u2212as electron acceptor. To our knowledge, our results provide the first experimental evidence that marine and freshwater anammox bacteria can couple NH4\u002B oxidation with EET, which is a significant finding, and challenges our perception of a key player of anaerobic oxidation of NH4\u002B in natural environments and engineered systems.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw, Dario R.; Ali, Muhammad; Katuri, Krishna P.; Gralnick, Jeffrey A.; Reimann, Joachim; Mesman, Rob; van Niftrik, Laura; Jetten, Mike S.

The probability of studied event (HAIE) during the studied period was calculate by Poisson distribution. Results. Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.25/patient-month during the previous 5 years (p=0.024). Two cases appeared during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with metilprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. There were no fatalities during the first 30 days of follow-up. Conclusion. The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care, appropriate use of corticosteroids and interleukin antagonists and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramos-Martinez, A.; Fernndez-Cruz, A.; Dominguez, F.; Forteza, A.; Cobo, M.; Sanchez-Romero, I.; asensio, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.17.20101063v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","HAIE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of HAIE","incidence of HAIE","etiology of HAIE","central venous catheter","local infection","serious infection","source of infection","studied period","COVID pandemic","study period","patient-month","peripheral venous catheter","sternal wound infection","admission","institution","epidemic","optimal catheter care","early treatment","treatment of infections","recent years","probability of studied event","appropriate use of corticosteroids","interleukin antagonists","hospitals","Staphylococcus aureus","major impact","urinary catheterization","progressive increase","Candida albicans","severe complication of medical procedures","pulmonary involvement","Enterococcus faecalis","healthcare","diagnosis","risk","infective endocarditis","metilprednisolone","tocilizumab","Poisson distribution","coronavirus outbreaks","clinical characteristics","months","days of follow-up","fatalities","order","Background","Objectives","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks. Our results show that processing the data in multi-tier health awareness system will reduce the overall delay significantly and enable efficient health data sharing.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quwaider, Muhannad; Jararweh, Yaser","journal":"Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb9ca2060dcc783d03a7fdfbba26ca5af8e01c08.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1569190X1630123X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X1630123X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reliable health awareness system","system functionality","reliable global health awareness system","novel global health awareness system","multi-tier health awareness system","centralized global cloud system","availability of resources","efficient health data sharing","multiple regions","global agreements","multiple challenges","multiple countries","emerging cloud computing services availability","large scale regions","outbreaks patterns","exceptional outbreaks","globe","large scale requirements","aforementioned challenges","domain experts","industrial countries","Ebola","H1N1","overall delay","monitored subjects","number of epidemic diseases","Zika","SARS","wide distribution","control point of view","issues","future countermeasure planning","tiers","infrastructure","mixed integer optimization formulation","paper","realization","early detection","reasonable cost","continents","emergencies","latency","results"],"language":"en"},

We further observed a striking gradient in COVID-19 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend Deprivation Index - a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation - and household income. Adjusting for such factors led to only modest attenuation of the increased risk in black participants, adjusted odds ratio 3.1 (95%CI 2.0-4.8).

The extent to which this increased risk relates to variation in pre-existing comorbidities, differences in testing or hospitalization patterns, or additional disparities in social determinants of health warrants further study.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, A.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis of a healthcare system surveillance program that included asymptomatic clinical (COVID-19 facing and non-COVID-19 facing), and non-clinical HCWs. A convenience sample of asymptomatic community residents (CR) was also tested. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs are reported. Proportional trend across HCW categories was tested using Chi Square trend test. Logistic regression model-based likelihood estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs with varying job functions and across different hospitals are reported as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and CI. Setting: Healthcare system comprising one tertiary care academic medical center and six large community hospitals across Greater Houston and a community sample. Participants: 2,872 self-reported asymptomatic adult (\u003E 18 years) HCWs and CRs. Exposure: Clinical HCWs in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units, non-Clinical HCWs, and CRs. Job categories of Nursing, Providers, Allied Health, Support, and Administration / Research. Seven hospitals in the healthcare system. Main Outcomes: Positive reverse transcriptase polymerized chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 Results: Among 2,872 asymptomatic HCWs and CRs, 3.9% (CI: 3.2 - 4.7) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mean (SD) age was 40.9 (11.7) years and 73% were females. Among COVID-19 facing HCWs 5.4% (CI: 4.5 - 6.5) were positive, whereas 0.6% (CI: 0.2 - 1.7%) of non COVID-19 facing HCWs and none of the non-clinical HCWs or CRs were positive (Ptrend \u003C 0.001). Among COVID-19 facing HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was similar for all job categories (p = 0.74). However, significant differences in positivity were observed across hospitals. Conclusions and Relevance: Asymptomatic HCWs with COVID-19 patient exposure had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive testing than those not routinely exposed to COVID-19 patients and those not engaged in patient care. Among HCWs with routine COVID-19 exposure, all job types had relatively similar infection rates. These data can inform hospital surveillance and infection control practices for patient-facing job classifications and suggest that general environmental exposure within hospitals is not a significant source of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vahidy, F.; Sostman, H.

Rapidly increasing infections has raised intense worldwide attention. How to model the evolution of COVID-19 effectively and efficiently is of great significance for prevention and control. Methods: We propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model based on the original single-chain model in [8] to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in Singapore. Multi-chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics. We identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function. Results: The numerical simulation results exhibit the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the range of 25% fluctuation from simulation results. It is predicted by multi-chain models that Singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak, thus stronger measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic. Conclusion: The multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model provides an effective way to early detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second outbreak. It can also explain the data in those countries where the single-chain model shows deviation from the data.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Hanshuang; Shao, Nian; Yan, Yue; Luo, Xinyue; Wang, Shufen; Ye, Ling; Cheng, Jin; Chen, Wenbin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0eb661c4fd71054e081ec1c357142e91b908fca9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multi-chain models","multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model","original single-chain model","Multi-chains","single chains","evolution of COVID","numerical simulation results","Singapore","data fitting","parameters of models","nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak","super spreaders","appearance of imported infectors","effective way","increasing infections","intense worldwide attention","superposition","countries","deviation","stronger measures","different characteristics","great significance","prevention","control","fluctuation","Conclusion","penalty function","range","Methods","Background","increments","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Sequence homology analysis showed that the ACE2 sequence in pigs is highly conserved among species at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Genetic evolution analysis revealed that ACE2 gene in pigs has the shortest genetic distance with that in goats while residing in a totally different branch from that in zebra fishes. Analysis of protein structure predicted that ACE2 protein is a transmembrane secreted protein with high hydrophilicity, containing a signal peptide sequences locating between 1aa to 17aa.

Abstract The 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world\u0027s population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels. More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage \u2013 in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control \u2013 should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID\u002B patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction.

The aim of this work is to provide a detailed description of the human respiratory mechanics in healthy and diseased conditions. The model used for this purpose employs some known constitutive functions of the main components of the respiratory system. We give a detailed mathematical description of these functions and subsequently derive additional key ones. We are interested not only in the main output such as airflow at the mouth or alveolar pressure and volume, but also in other quantities such as resistance and pressure drop across each element of the system and even recoil and compliance of the chest wall. Pathological conditions are simulated by altering the parameters of the constitutive functions. Results show that increased upper airway resistance induces airflow reduction with concomitant narrowing of volume and pressure ranges without affecting lung compliance. Instead, increased elastic recoil leads to low volumes and decreased lung compliance. The model could be used in the study of the interaction between respiratory and cardiovascular systems in pathophysiological conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marconi, Silvia; De Lazzari, Claudio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bdb5fd71a5cf23462e3aacae42ba4e4d83c0c04.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378475420301737; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475420301737?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory system","lung mechanics","decreased lung compliance","human respiratory mechanics","pressure ranges","alveolar pressure","known constitutive functions","detailed description","diseased conditions","pathophysiological conditions","Pathological conditions","increased upper airway resistance","detailed mathematical description","airflow reduction","main components","main output","elastic recoil","concomitant narrowing of volume","low volumes","cardiovascular systems","mouth","interaction","Results","purpose","D models","pneumatic-electrical analogy","additional key ones","work","study","element","quantities","parameters","chest wall","aim"],"language":"en"},

Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases.

It can be difficult to accurately predict mortality among COVID-19 patients presenting with a spectrum of complications, hindering the prognostication and management of the disease. Methods: We applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of 5,051 COVID-19 patients treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, the global COVID-19 epicenter, to predict mortality. Predictors were designed to classify patients into Deceased or Alive mortality classes and were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score). Findings: Using a development cohort (n=3,841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we identified a COVID-19 mortality predictor that demonstrated high accuracy (AUC=0.91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical features: age, minimum O2 saturation during encounter, type of patient encounter (inpatient vs. various types of outpatient and telehealth encounters), hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature. Interpretation: An accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality predictor based on five features may have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yadaw, A.

While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. These assays were developed with negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general population and samples from COVID19 patients. Results: The assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as 3 days post symptom onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Conclusion: Serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers will also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amanat, F.; Nguyen, T.; Chromikova, V.; Strohmeier, S.; Stadlbauer, D.; Javier, A.; Jiang, K.; Asthagiri-Arunkumar, G.; Polanco, J.; Bermudez-Gonzalez, M.; Caplivski, D.; Cheng, A.; Kedzierska, K.; Vapalahti, O.; Hepojoki, J.; Simon, V.; Krammer, F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.17.20037713v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["molecular assays","serological assays suitable","specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov","COVID19 patients","serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","Coronavirus Disease","identification of COVID19 seroconverters","spike protein of SARS","infected patients","severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus","general population","human plasma","given population","antibody titers","screening of health care workers","negative control samples","reactive human donors","generation of convalescent serum","risk of viral spread","viral genetic material","diagnosis of acute infection","different antibody types","background immunity","pre-COVID","previous exposure","ELISA","critical importance","seroprevalence","colleagues","recombinant antigens","days post symptom onset","Conclusion","handling of infectious virus","China","Methods","Results","Introduction","antibodies","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for reaction times or physiological correlates. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results revealed participants in the bottom 25th percentile overestimated their percentile, while participants in the top 75th percentile underestimated their percentile, exhibiting the classic DKE. Reaction time measures revealed a condition x group interaction whereby over-estimators responded faster than under-estimators when estimating being in the top percentile and responded slower when estimating being in the bottom percentile. Between-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and under-estimators during Dunning-Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators from 400-600 ms, whereas \u2018old-new\u2019 memory ERP effects revealed a late parietal component (LPC) associated with recollection-based processing from 600-900 ms for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over- and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators rely on recollection during memory and over-estimators draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgments of illusory superiority and inferiority. Graphical Abstract Event-related potentials (ERPS) were recorded for the Dunning-Kruger Effect as subjects made metacognitive judgments about performance on a memory task. Over- and Under-estimators exhibited a crossover interaction in response times when believing they did best and worst, respectively. A crossover pattern was also observed for ERPs: LPC signals of recollection were found for under-estimators, whereas familiarity-based FN400 effects were evident for over-estimators and correlated with estimates.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Alana; Sirianni, Lindsey A.; Addante, Richard J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b859f6a922e4ed753c84a701fdef3aa7622c7af.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.26.888511","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DKE","EEG","ERP","LPC","Graphical Abstract"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["over-estimators","under-estimators","percentile","memory task","episodic memory","effects of familiarity","memory ERP effects","performance","participants","estimating","Dunning-Kruger Effect","familiarity-based FN400 effects","Dunning-Kruger responses","metacognitive judgments of illusory superiority","metacognitive phenomenon of illusory superiority","excess familiarity","ERPS","crossover interaction","group EEG differences","recollection-based processing","LPC signals of recollection","reaction times","ms","classic DKE","individuals","condition x group interaction","response times","crossover pattern","Reaction time measures","late parietal component","subjects","differing cognitive processes","old-new","contributory role","Graphical Abstract Event-related potentials","test of item recognition","electroencephalography","inferiority","physiological correlates","Findings","novel method","estimates","Results","worst"],"language":"en"},

Methods.The ChiCTR database was comprehensively searched, and the COVID-19 research registration information as of February 24, 2020 was counted. Descriptive analysis of registration time trends and geographical distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare the statistical differences between different study types, intervention methods, research phases and major sponsors. Frequency studies were used to analyze the characteristics of CMT and BI therapy. Results.232 COVID-19 studies registered at the ChiCTR Center were collected. The overall number of COVID-19 registrations was increased. Hubei Province, China has the largest number of registrations, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. There were significant differences between the number of participants (P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000), and blind method (P=0.000) for different study types. Significant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study(P=0.022), of participants numbe(P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods. There were significant differences in study assignment (P=0.043) between the early and late studies. CMT drugs with high research frequency are chloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and I-IFN, which are all in phase 4; BI was Cell therapy, plasma therapy, Thymosin, and M/P-AB, which are all in early stages. Conclusion.There were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions. Different research types, intervention methods, and research stages lead to significant differences in some dimensions of the COVID-19 study. Finally, statistical high-frequency research drugs can provide more treatment options and evidence-based evidence for the clinical practice.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"song, gao; cheng, meng qun; wei, xian wen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17e3ab4cf7d680a3e6503ab733c5b138a91f2351.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20034934","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease","CMT","BI","M/P-AB"],"locations":["China","Zhejiang","Sichuan"],"keyphrases":["study assignment","P-AB","study duration","different study types","Different research types","research stages","research registration information","research phases","significant differences","high research frequency","dimensions of multicenter study","intervention methods","statistical differences","Frequency studies","statistical high-frequency research drugs","overall number of COVID","problems of unclear classification of research types","clinical characteristics","BI therapy","number of participants","late studies","evidence-based evidence","Cell therapy","plasma therapy","information reference","CMT drugs","characteristics of CMT","largest number of registrations","clinical practice","various dimensions","early stages","ChiCTR Center","ChiCTR database","information-based data foundation","irregular registration behavior","Chinese Clinical Trial Registry","participants numbe","Descriptive analysis of registration time trends","treatment options","chloroquine","novel Corona Virus Disease","China","lopinavir","Thymosin","geographical distribution","major sponsors","ritonavir","Guangdong","spread","Hubei Province","Zhejiang","heterogeneity","blind method","Sichuan","IFN","Conclusion","epidemic","Results","Chi-square test","Background"],"language":"en"},

One of the challenges to contain the COVID-19 is making people adopt personal hygiene, social distancing and self-quarantine practices which are all related to knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of the people in respective countries. Bangladesh, the most densely populated countries with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may give the policy makers to make informed decisions. Hence, this study aimed to make a quick assessment of KAP of people in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1837 responses across Bangladesh. However, 1589 completed responses were included in statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores, their interrelations with socio-demographic variables. The overall KAP is poor with only 10% of the respondents showed good knowledge with parallel attitudes and practices. Socio-demographic factors have strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP score is evident in female over male respondents, among aged (45 years and above) over younger respondents and among retired and homemakers above students and public service holders. The study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to gain public confidence and arrest more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures. The study provides a baseline of KAP among people in Bangladesh on COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paul, A.; Sikdar, D.; Hossain, M. M.; Amin, M.

Methods and implications for safety","doi":"10.1101/2020.04.07.20057224","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"Background and Objectives: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has lead to a global decrease in protection ware, especially facepiece filtering respirators (FFRs). Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of descontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light dosage varies significantly on different respirator angles, and propose a method to descontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. Methods: An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 x55 x 33 cm with three 15W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 x 41 x 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3M of dimensions 17 x 9 x 4cm, and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR with dimensions 17 x 6 x 5 cm. A spectrometer STN-SilverNova was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. Results: The data obtained reveal that the dosage received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the luminaires plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant in order to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Conclusion: Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance, angle of incidence of the light source. Careful dosage measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baluja, A.; Arines, J.; Vilanova, R.; Bao-Varela, C.; Flores-Arias, M.

Design: On-line cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected between 20th and 22nd April. Participants: 6149 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Main outcome measures: Perceived immunity to COVID-19, self-reported adherence to social distancing measures (going out for essential shopping, nonessential shopping, and meeting up with friends/family; total out-of-home activity), worry about COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 to oneself and people in the UK. Knowledge that cough and high temperature / fever are the main symptoms of COVID-19. Results: In this sample, 1493 people (24.3%) thought they had had COVID-19. Only 245 (4.0%) reported receiving a test result saying they had COVID-19. Reported test results were often incongruent with participants\u0027 belief that they had had COVID-19.

To allow every laboratory or hospital access to an inhouse assay, we developed two low cost SARSCoV2 detection assay protocols using inhouse primers and reagents equipment on hand in most biology or diagnostic laboratories a SYBR Green based RTPCR and PCR assays. RNA extraction has also become a major bottleneck due to limited supplies and the required labor. Thus, we validated alternative RNA extraction protocols. Methods SARSCoV2 genome sequences deposited into the GISAID database were retrieved to design and synthesize inhouse primers. Forty patient samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab, coded, and used to develop and validate the assay protocols. Both assays used TRIzol and heat-processing techniques to extract RNA from patient samples and to inactivate the virus; thus, testing was conducted in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the primers were evaluated using samples previously confirmed positive for SARSCoV2. The positive amplicons were sequenced to confirm the results. The assay protocols were developed, and the specificity of each PCR product was confirmed using melting curve analyses. The most accurate heat processing technique for primers with short amplicon lengths was 95C for 15 mins. Of 40 samples, both the SYBR Green based quantitative RTPCR assay and the PCR assay detected SARSCoV2 target genes in 28 samples, with no false positive or false-negative results. These findings were concordant with those of the diagnostic laboratory that tested the same samples using a Rotor Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARSCoV2 kit (R2=0.889). Conclusions These approaches are reliable, repeatable, specific, sensitive, simple, and low cost tools for the detection of SARSCoV2 in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory, offering alternative approaches when commercial kits are unavailable or cost ineffective.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alhamlan, F.; Alqahtani, A.; Bakheet, D.; Bohol, M.; Althawadi, S.; Mutabagani, M.; Almaghrabi, R.; Obeid, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/213bfaeecf1aee748a2ae5891f43e7b8ac1294b7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.20105510v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green","PCR","RNA","Rotor Gene PCR","Altona Diagnostics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of SARSCoV2","inhouse assay","low cost SARSCoV2 detection assay protocols","patient samples","inhouse primers","commercial SARSCoV2 testing kit","SARSCoV2 target genes","PCR assays","diagnostic laboratory","Altona Diagnostics SARSCoV2 kit","alternative RNA extraction protocols","SYBR Green based quantitative RTPCR assay","PCR product","Methods SARSCoV2 genome sequences","confirmed positive","SYBR Green based RTPCR","alternative approaches","low cost tools","conventional biosafety level","virus","false-negative results","positive amplicons","specificity","Rotor Gene PCR cycler","heat-processing techniques","commercial kits","diagnostic laboratories","accurate heat processing technique","major bottleneck","major challenge","biology","hand","short amplicon lengths","reagents equipment","limited supplies","reagent availability","COVID19","TRIzol","nasopharyngeal swab","R2","hospital access","melting curve analyses","GISAID database","required labor","Conclusions","mins","Background","sensitivity","findings"],"language":"en"},

MEDLINE, the OVID databases, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched for the period October 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. Snowballing was used to identify additional studies. Study Selection. Observational studies (n=19) reporting on 61,455 patients with relative risks (RR) or hazard ratios or odds ratios that reported the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 and comorbid conditions were included for the current study. Data Extraction and Synthesis. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified. Main Outcomes and Measures The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing conditions, reported as RR. Comorbidities explored were cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and stroke. Results. Ten chronic conditions from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n=61,455 patients with COVID-19; mean age, 61 years; 57% male). Any cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer significantly increased the risk of mortality from COVID-19. Cardiovascular disease was associated with a 135% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (RR=2.35, 95%CI 1.44-3.84 n=9). The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease was 2.4 times as high as those without coronary heart disease (RR= 2.40, 95%CI=1.71-3.37, n=5) and twice as high in patients with hypertension as high as that compared to those without hypertension (RR=1.89, 95%CI= 1.58-2.27, n=9).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is viral infection that generates a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious pneumonia that may result in progressive respiratory failure and death. What are the goals of this investigation? This study explains the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths and suggests general lessons learned for a strategy to cope with future epidemics similar to COVID-19 to reduce viral infectivity and negative impacts in economic systems and society. What are the results of this study? The main results are: o The accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution. o Hinterland cities have average days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) equal to 80 days, and an average number of infected more than 2,000 individuals as of April 1st, 2020, coastal cities have days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 equal to 60 days and have about 700 infected in average. o Cities that average number of 125 days exceeding the limits set for PM10, last year, they have an average number of infected individual higher than 3,200 units, whereas cities having less than 100 days (average number of 48 days) exceeding the limits set for PM10, they have an average number of about 900 infected individuals. o The results reveal that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in specific environments is due to two mechanisms given by: air pollution-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission; in particular, the mechanisms of air pollution-to-human transmission play a critical role rather than human-to-human transmission. o The finding here suggests that to minimize future epidemic similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which cities can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological condition, is less than 50 days. After this critical threshold, the analytical output here suggests that environmental inconsistencies because of the combination between air pollution and meteorological conditions (with high moisture%, low wind speed and fog) trigger a take-off of viral infectivity (accelerated epidemic diffusion) with damages for health of population, economy and society. What is a socioeconomic strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19? Considering the complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity, lessons learned for COVID-19 have to be applied for a proactive socioeconomic strategy to cope with future epidemics, especially an environmental policy based on reduction of air pollution mainly in hinterland zones of countries, having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog that create an environment that can damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission of viral infectivity similar to the COVID-19. This study must conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID 19 has also to be designed in environmental and sustainability science and not only in terms of biology.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coccia, Mario","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f5e7a9da8bd69aad97828725f45dc9afa7e8fc1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055657","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["average days","human transmission","transmission dynamics of COVID","accelerated diffusion of COVID","max number of days","vast diffusion of COVID","limits","o Cities","mechanisms of air pollution","future epidemics similar","reduction of air pollution","fast transmission of viral infectivity similar","o Hinterland cities","average number of infected individual higher","PM10 equal","take-off of viral infectivity","high moisture","viral infection","coastal cities","infected individuals","study","biological characteristics of viral infectivity","meteorological conditions","high association","epidemic diffusion","environmental inconsistencies","environmental policy","high percentage of moisture","proactive socioeconomic strategy","low wind speed","high level of deaths","geo-environmental determinants","fog","year","society","main results","general lessons","North Italy","critical role","critical threshold","hinterland zones of countries","progressive respiratory failure","severe acute respiratory syndrome","serious pneumonia","negative impacts","combination","economic systems","health of population","damages","analytical output","micrometers","particulate matter","complex interaction","economy","diameter","units","ozone","immune system of people","specific environments","sustainability science","terms of biology","Coronavirus disease","finding","goals","investigation"],"language":"en"},

Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Hui; Cui, Jing-an; Yang, Guo-Jing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c6e523654a7eab291bd150a6894986f76a30b4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029629","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Markov Chain Monte Carlo"],"locations":["China","Hubei"],"keyphrases":["mainland China","Hubei province","parts of China","self-protection measures","disease transmission","effective reproduction ratio","intervention measures","epidemic trend","control reproduction number Rc","epidemic ending","novel COVID","effective daily reproduction ratio","transmission dynamic model","outbreak of coronavirus disease","risk of partial lifting control measures","real-time epidemic situation","novel mathematical model","suppressed COVID","spread of disease","people","reduction of contact","Results","contact rate","sufficient personal protection","quarantine of entry","evolution of interventions","Chinese government","MCMC","published data","Markov Chain Monte Carlo","travel restriction","longer time","estimation outcomes","tracing","isolation","containment strategies","effectiveness","masks","Conclusions","Methods","normal level","aim","conditions","Wuhan","Background"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, to overcome these difficulties, recent advances in genetic engineering techniques and phage display technique have allowed the production of highly specific recombinant antibodies. These engineered antibodies have been constructed in the hunt for novel therapeutic drugs equipped with enhanced immunoprotective abilities, such as engaging immune effector functions, effective development of fusion proteins, efficient tumor and tissue penetration, and high-affinity antibodies directed against conserved targets. Advanced antibody engineering techniques have extensive applications in the fields of immunology, biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutic medicines.

This study is primarily based on primary protein sequence analysis through the chemical basis of embedded amino acids. Firstly, we look for the chemical group specific score of amino acids. Along with this, we have developed a new methodology for the phylogenetic analysis based on chemical group dissimilarities of amino acids. This new methodology is applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and pinpoint how a particular sequence is differing with others. Secondly, we build a graph theoretic model on using amino acid sequences which is also applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and some unique characteristics and their domains are highlighted. Thirdly, we search for unique patterns as subsequences which are common among the group or specific individual member. In all the cases, we are able to show some distinct features of PpcA that emerges PpcA as an outstanding protein compared to its other homologs, resulting towards its binding with deoxycholate. Similarly, some notable features for the structurally dissimilar protein PpcD compared to the other homologs are also brought out. Further, the five members of cytochrome family being homolog proteins, they must have some common significant features which are also enumerated in this study.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Jayanta Kumar; Pal Choudhury, Pabitra","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f3106f6c5402784319dd722bbbaaa5f5b59df1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5376323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Geobacter"],"keyphrases":["PpcA protein","homologs","outstanding protein","members of cytochrome family","primary protein sequence analysis","cytochrome c7 family members","primary protein sequence information","chemical group dissimilarities of amino acids","chemical group specific score of amino acids","dissimilar protein PpcD","distinct features of PpcA","chemical basis of embedded amino acids","Periplasmic c7 type cytochrome","amino acid sequences","common significant features","particular sequence","notable features","new methodology","Deoxycholate","study","phylogenetic analysis","unique characteristics","unique patterns","specific individual member","observation","graph theoretic model","homolog proteins","crystal structure viewpoint","subsequences","reason","DXCA","certainty","domains","PpcB-E","binding","Geobacter","cases"],"language":"en"},

Although many viral mRNAs are devoid of one or both of these structures, they can still translate efficiently using non-canonical mechanisms. Here, we review the tools utilized by positive-sense single-stranded (\u002Bss) RNA plant viruses to initiate non-canonical translation, focusing on cis-acting sequences present in viral mRNAs. We highlight how these elements may interact with host translation factors and speculate on their contribution for achieving translational control. We also describe other translation strategies used by plant viruses to optimize the usage of the coding capacity of their very compact genomes, including leaky scanning initiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough. Finally, future research perspectives on the unusual translational strategies of \u002BssRNA viruses are discussed, including parallelisms between viral and host mRNAs mechanisms of translation, particularly for host mRNAs which are translated under stress conditions.","publish_time":"2017-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miras, Manuel; Miller, W.

Indeed, a challenge is to assess the potential for change of patients so as to offer appropriate therapeutic interventions and enhance treatment program efficacy. This naturalistic study aimed to identify the socio-demographical characteristics and clinical profiles at admission of patients referred to a specialized Crisis Intervention Center (CIC) and to examine the effectiveness of the intervention. METHOD: The sample was composed of 352 adult outpatients recruited among the referrals to the CIC. Assessment completed at admission and at discharge examined psychiatric symptoms, defense mechanisms, recovery styles and global functioning. The crisis intervention consisted in a psychodynamically oriented multimodal approach associated with medication. RESULTS: Regarding the clinical profiles at intake, patients were middle-aged (M = 38.56, SD = 10.91), with a higher proportion of women (62.22%). They were addressed to the CIC because they had attempted to commit suicide or had suicidal ideation or presented depressed mood related to interpersonal difficulties. No statistical differences were found between patients dropping out (n = 215) and those attending the crisis intervention (n = 137). Crisis intervention demonstrated a beneficial effect (p \u003C 0.01) on almost all variables, with Effect Sizes (ES) ranging from small to large (0.12 \u003C ES \u003C 0.75; median = 0.49). However, the Reliable Change Index indicated that most of the issues fall into the undetermined category (range 41.46 to 96.35%; median = 66.20%). CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the profile of patients referred to the CIC and shows that more than half of the patients dropped out from the crisis intervention before completion. Our findings suggest that people presenting an emotional crisis benefit from crisis intervention. However, given methodological constraints, these results need to be considered with caution. Moreover, the clinical significance of the improvements is not confirmed. Thus, the effectiveness of crisis intervention in naturalistic context is not fully determined and should be more rigorously studied in future research.

Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. account for more than 80 % of invasive fungal infections in solid organ recipients. This co-occurrence of two commonly seen opportunistic infections may end up in fatality. Here, we present a case of concomitant Aspergillus spp. and CMV infection and discuss the relevant literature. A 54-year-old male patient presented with fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain on the 9th posttransplant week after renal transplantation. CMV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 1,680,000 copies/ml, thus, valganciclovir dose was increased. There were inspiratory crackles at both lung bases, and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple fungal balls throughout the right lung. Galactomannan antigen was positive, and voriconazole and other antimicrobials were subsequently added to the treatment. At the end of the therapy, on control CT, pneumonic consolidation had disappeared, sputum cultures didn\u2019t show Aspergillus spp., and CMV-DNA reduced to 700 copies/ml. The patient showed a favorable clinical response to combined treatment; fever, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain disappeared. Both CMV disease and aspergillosis may present as pulmonary disease; thus, the characterization of one may not preclude the search for the other and the timely initiation of treatment is of paramount importance for good outcomes.","publish_time":"2012-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Solak, Yalcin; Biyik, Zeynep; Cizmecioglu, Ahmet; Genc, Nejdet; Ozbek, Orhan; Gaipov, Abduzhappar; Yeksan, Mehdi","journal":"CEN Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76a329e95456971efefd60241bb0a8af22a2f7a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5413728.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5413728/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aspergillus"],"organizations":["CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV-DNA","CMV infection","CMV disease","solid organ recipients","fever","invasive fungal infections","combined treatment","pleuritic chest pain","transplant recipients","copies","end","expense of increased incidence of opportunistic infections","chest computed tomography","timely initiation of treatment","case of concomitant Aspergillus","lung bases","control CT","right lung","pulmonary disease","preventive therapy","multiple fungal balls","year-old male patient","acute rejection episodes","dyspnea","favorable clinical response","advent of potent immunosuppressive options","paramount importance","pneumonic consolidation","polymerase chain reaction","PCR","posttransplant week","shortness of breath","voriconazole","sputum cultures","aspergillosis","cytomegalovirus","good outcomes","Galactomannan antigen","renal transplantation","inspiratory crackles","antimicrobials","relevant literature","absence","characterization","Candida","account","co-occurrence","fatality","valganciclovir dose","search"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: First, we performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study that enrolled septic patients with or without thrombocytopenia to determine the association between platelet desialylation and thrombocytopenia in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Gender- and age-matched healthy adults were selected as normal controls in analysis of the platelet desialylation levels (study I). Next, we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the patients who had severe sepsis with thrombocytopenia (platelet counts \u226450 \u00D7 10(9)/L) were randomly assigned to receive antimicrobial therapy alone (control group) or antimicrobial therapy plus oseltamivir (oseltamivir group) in a 1:1 ratio (study II). The primary outcomes were platelet desialylation level at study entry, overall platelet response rate within 14 days post-randomization, and all-cause mortality within 28 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included platelet recovery time, the occurrence of bleeding events, and the amount of platelets transfused within 14 days post-randomization. RESULTS: The platelet desialylation levels increased significantly in the 127 septic patients with thrombocytopenia compared to the 134 patients without thrombocytopenia. A platelet response was achieved in 45 of the 54 patients in the oseltamivir group (83.3%) compared with 34 of the 52 patients in the control group (65.4%; P = 0.045). The median platelet recovery time was 5 days (interquartile range 4\u20136) in the oseltamivir group compared with 7 days (interquartile range 5\u201310) in the control group (P = 0.003). The amount of platelets transfused decreased significantly in the oseltamivir group compared to the control group (P = 0.044). There was no difference in the overall 28-day mortality regardless of whether oseltamivir was used. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and platelet recovery time were independent indicators of oseltamivir therapy. The main reason for all of the mortalities was multiple-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia was associated with increased platelet desialylation in septic patients. The addition of oseltamivir could significantly increase the platelet response rate, shorten platelet recovery time, and reduce platelet transfusion.

Therefore, research into blocking TLR activation to treat these disorders has become a hot topic. Here, we report the immunomodulatory properties of a nonstimulatory CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN), CpG-c41, which had previously only been known as a TLR9 antagonist. In this study, we found that both in vitro and in vivo CpG-c41 decreased levels of various proinflammatory factors that were induced by single activation or coactivation of intracellular TLRs, but not membrane-bound TLRs, no matter what downstream signal pathways the TLRs depend on. Moreover, CpG-c41 attenuated excessive inflammation in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model of skin inflammation by suppressing immune cell infiltration and release of inflammatory factors. We also found evidence that the immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on other intracellular TLRs are mediated by a TLR9-independent mechanism. These results suggest that CpG-c41 acts as an upstream of signaling cascades, perhaps on the processes of ligand internalization and transfer. Taken together, these results suggest that CpG-c41 disrupts various aspects of intracellular TLR activation and provides a deeper insight into the regulation of innate immunity.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wancheng; Yang, Xuejiao; Wang, Ning; Fan, Shijun; Zhu, Yuanfeng; Zheng, Xinchuan; Li, Yan","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/212b5e2ca9c78f0864f5a8540b36b3c18ad06d27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5429961.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5429961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Toll-like"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CpG-c41 acts","nonstimulatory CpG","CpG-ODN","immunosuppressive effects of CpG","coactivation of intracellular TLRs","various aspects of intracellular TLR activation","blocking TLR activation","inappropriate inflammation","excessive inflammation","single activation","membrane-bound TLRs","results","TLR9 antagonist","TLR9-independent mechanism","mouse model of skin inflammation","levels of various proinflammatory factors","release of inflammatory factors","imiquimod-induced psoriasis","immune cell infiltration","matter","deeper insight","chronic autoimmune diseases","disorders","receptor","Toll","oligodeoxynucleotide","regulation of innate immunity","signal pathways","processes of ligand internalization","growing body of literature","transfer","cascades","immunomodulatory properties","evidence","TLR7","research","hot topic","study"],"language":"en"},

This study examined factors associated with poultry farmers\u2019 adoption of personal protective behaviours (PPBs) based on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). METHODS: Totally, 297 poultry farmers in three cities of Jiangsu Province, China were interviewed during November 2013-January 2014. Data on PMT constructs, perceived trustworthiness of A/H7N9 information from mass media (formal sources), friends and family (informal sources), intention to adopt and actual adoption of PPBs and respondents\u2019 demographics were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) identified associations between demographic factors and PMT constructs associated with A/H7N9-oriented PPB intention. Moderated mediation analysis examined how demographics moderated the effects of information trust on PPB intention via risk perceptions of A/H7N9. RESULTS: Respondents generally perceived low vulnerability to A/H7N9 infection. The SEM found that male respondents perceived lower severity of (\u03B2 = \u22120.23), and lower vulnerability to (\u03B2 = -0.15) A/H7N9 infection; age was positively associated with both perceived personal vulnerability to (\u03B2 = 0.21) and perceived self-efficacy (\u03B2 = 0.24) in controlling A/H7N9; education was positively associated with perceived response efficacy (\u03B2 = 0.40). Furthermore, perceived vulnerability (\u03B2 = 0.16), perceived self-efficacy (\u03B2 = 0.21) and response efficacy (\u03B2 = 0.67) were positively associated with intention to adopt PPBs against A/H7N9. More trust in informal information (TII) was only significantly associated with greater PPB intention through its positive association with perceived response efficacy. Age significantly moderated the associations of TII with perceived Self-efficacy and perceived response efficacy, with younger farmers who had greater TII perceiving lower self-efficacy but higher response efficacy. CONCLUSION: Poultry farmers perceive A/H7N9 as a personally-irrelevant risk. Interventions designed to enhance perceived response efficacy, particularly among lower educated respondents may effectively motivate adoption of PPBs. Informal information may be an important resource for enhancing response efficacy.

The emergence of resistance to anti-influenza drugs underlines the need to develop new drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-influenza viral activity and possible mechanisms of 12 phenanthrenes from the medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Orchidaceae family). METHODS: Twelve phenanthrenes were isolated and identified from B. striata. Influenza virus A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) propagated in embryonated chicken eggs was used. Phenanthrenes mixed with the virus were incubated at 37 \u00B0C for 1 h and then inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic route to survey the antiviral activity in vivo. A (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H\u2013tetrazolium) (MTS)-based assay was performed to evaluate the reduction of cytopathic effect induced by H3N2 on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to study the blockage of virus receptors by the phenanthrenes, and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay to evaluate the effects of the release of virus. The synthesis of influenza viral matrix protein mRNA in response to compound treatment was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: This study showed that phenanthrenes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 significantly inhibited the viruses in vivo, with inhibition rates of 20.7, 79.3, 17.2, 34.5, 34.5, 34.5, 44.8, 75.9, and 34.5%, respectively. In MDCK models, the phenanthrenes did not show significant antiviral activity when administered as pretreatment, while phenanthrenes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 10, and 11 exhibited inhibitory activities as simultaneous treatment with 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) ranging from 14.6 \u00B1 2.4 to 43.3 \u00B1 5.3 \u03BCM. The IC(50) ranged from 18.4 \u00B1 3.1 to 42.3 \u00B1 3.9 \u03BCM in the post-treatment assays. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on NA; and compounds 2, 3, 4 6, 7, 10, and 11 resulted in the reduced transcription of virus matrix protein mRNA. However, no compound could inhibit hemagglutination by the influenza virus. CONCLUSION: Phenanthrenes from B. striata had strong anti-influenza viral activity in both embryonated eggs and MDCK models, and diphenanthrenes seemed to have stronger inhibition activity compared with monophenanthrenes.

No effective drugs are available clinically on toxoplasmosis. Chinese traditional herbal medicines have provided remedies for many health problems. There exists a possibility that Chinese herbs may provide protection against T. gondii. This work aims to assess the protective efficacy of combined Chinese herbs against T. gondii. We screened five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects and combined them into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle. The drug potential and protective efficacy were evaluated through a mouse model by determining the survival time, the parasite load in blood and tissues, the change of cell proportions in blood and histological detection. The results showed that the survival time of mice in the 500 mg Chinese herbs group and sulfadiazine group was significantly longer than that of the PBS control group. Also the parasite load in blood and tissues of 500 mg Chinese herbs and sulfadiazine groups was significantly lower than that of PBS group at 7 days post infection (dpi), which was in accordance with the result of histological detection. Monocyte and neutrophil of infected mice were remarkably increased while lymphocyte was dramatically decreased compared to that of blank group at 7 dpi. The results demonstrated that the 500 mg dosage of our Chinese herbs could slow down the replication of T. gondii and prolong the survival time of mice and could be considered as possible candidate drug against toxoplasmosis.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhuo, Xun-hui; Sun, Hong-chao; Huang, Bin; Yu, Hai-jie; Shan, Ying; Du, Ai-fang","journal":"Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45694460eb735606f756b5850caced2cd8b313d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5482040.xml.json","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1631/jzus.B1600316.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chinese herbs group","protective efficacy of combined Chinese herbs","PBS group","Chinese traditional herbal medicines","survival time of mice","blank group","PBS control group","Toxoplasma gondii","traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle","tissues","parasite load","warm-blood animals","toxoplasmosis","results","neutrophil of infected mice","result of histological detection","sulfadiazine groups","drug potential","possible candidate drug","remedies","change of cell proportions","worldwide spread protozoan","mouse model","different pharmacological effects","days post infection","prescription","protection","effective drugs","Monocyte","accordance","possibility","dosage","replication","health problems","lymphocyte","work"],"language":"en"},

NormFinder analyses showed that the two most stable reference genes in response to POT and POT\u002BN were 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and HMBS, RPL4, respectively. BestKeeper analyses showed that 18S rRNA, RPL4 and HPRT1, HMBS were the two most stable reference genes for POT, and POT\u002BN, respectively. Of the ten reference genes, all except B2M showed geNorm M \u003C0.5, suggesting that they were stably expressed in the shell gland tissue. Consensus from these three programs suggested HPRT1 and HMBS could be used as the two most stable reference genes in the present study. Expression analyses of four candidate target genes with the two most and the two least stable genes showed that a combination of stable reference genes leads to more discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes, while the least stable genes failed to do so. Therefore, HMBS and HPRT1 are recommended as the two most stable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data at different stages of eggshell formation in brown-egg laying hens. Available statistical programs for reference gene ranking should include more robust analysis capability to analyse the gene expression data generated from factorial design experiments.","publish_time":"2017-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samiullah, Sami; Roberts, Juliet; Wu, Shu-Biao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/222f2de4774452963b9c8b640faf80dced073b64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5495395.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495395/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stable genes","combination of stable reference genes","POT","candidate target genes","HMBS","reference gene ranking","Expression analyses","HPRT1","discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes","normalization of gene expression data","RPL4","S rRNA","shell gland of laying hens","BestKeeper analyses","NormFinder analyses","response","S ribosomal RNA","brown-egg laying hens","geNorm","shell gland tissue","ribosomal protein L4","Available statistical programs","different stages of eggshell formation","robust analysis capability","post-oviposition time","factorial design experiments","hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase","nicarbazin treatment","present study","hydroxymethylbilane synthase","B2M","Consensus"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the presence of E. coli in tissue samples (liver, lung and intestines) collected from 50 fruit bats of five different species (Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata, Rousettus aegyptiacus) of two different areas in the Republic of Congo between 2009 and 2010. To assess E. coli pathotypes and phylogenetic relationships, we determined the presence of 59 virulence associated genes and multilocus sequence types (STs). Isolates were further tested for their susceptibility to several antimicrobial substances by agar disk diffusion test and for the presence of an Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase phenotype. E. coli was detected in 60% of the bats analysed. The diversity of E. coli strains was very high, with 37 different STs within 40 isolates. Occasionally, we detected sequence types (e.g. ST69, ST127, and ST131) and pathotypes (e.g. ExPEC, EPEC and atypical EPEC), which are known pathogens in human and/or animal infections. Although the majority of strains were assigned to phylogenetic group B2 (46.2%), which is linked with the ExPEC pathovar, occurrence of virulence-associated genes in these strains were unexpectedly low. Due to this, and as only few of the E. coli isolates showed intermediate resistance to certain antimicrobial substances, we assume a rather na\u00EFve E. coli population, lacking contact to humans or domestic animals. Future studies featuring in depth comparative whole genome sequence analyses will provide insights into the microevolution of this interesting strain collection.","publish_time":"2017-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nowak, Kathrin; Fahr, Jakob; Weber, Natalie; L\u00FCbke-Becker, Antina; Semmler, Torsten; Weiss, Sabrina; Mombouli, Jean-Vivien; Wieler, Lothar H.; Guenther, Sebastian; Leendertz, Fabian H.; Ewers, Christa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3411ca577f8a7a81a4bc8a3caff019243d75af9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5507484.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5507484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Republic","Congo"],"keyphrases":["coli strains","coli isolates","coli pathotypes","Escherichia coli","coli population","presence of","different STs","different species","different areas","multilocus sequence types","associated genes","majority of strains","fruit bats","certain antimicrobial substances","genome sequence analyses","human health","occurrence of virulence","Future studies","domestic animals","ExPEC pathovar","animal infections","phylogenetic relationships","atypical EPEC","viral pathogens relevant","phylogenetic group B2","Hypsignathus monstrosus","Epomops franqueti","Eidolon helvum","lacking contact","Myonycteris torquata","Rousettus aegyptiacus","depth comparative","agar disk diffusion test","humans","intermediate resistance","tissue samples","microevolution","intestines","insights","liver","ST127","Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase phenotype","lung","ST131","ST69","reservoir","susceptibility","interesting strain collection","Republic of Congo","diversity of"],"language":"en"},

However, the mechanism of its protective effects is not yet clear. The objective of this study was to investigate molecular factors involved in the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of EPF in obese mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Male h ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were fed a HFD containing or not containing the EPF (50 or 100 mg/kg) for eight weeks. EPF reduced body weight gain, lipid accumulation in livers and levels of lipid, glucose and insulin in plasma as well as reduced insulin resistance as compared with the HFD group. EPF significantly decreased serum aminotransferase activity of the HFD group. We observed that EPF administration significantly increased the level of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and prevented fat deposits in livers and HepG2 cells, but these effects were blocked by compound C (an AMPK inhibitor). The protective effects of EPF were probably associated with the decrease in HMGCR, SREBP-1c and FAS expressions and the increase in CPT1 and phosphor-IRS-1 expressions. Our results suggest that EPF might be a potential natural candidate for the treatment and/or prevention of overweight and hepatic and metabolic-related alterations induced by HFD.","publish_time":"2017-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Chanmin; Ma, Jieqiong; Sun, Jianmei; Cheng, Chao; Feng, Zhaojun; Jiang, Hong; Yang, Wei","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef35abb710975a602c24e4eff920d99c022e9132.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5622719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPF","ICR (Institute of Cancer Research","HFD","FAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protective effects of EPF","EPF administration","hypolipidemic effects of EPF","HFD group","livers","lipid accumulation","levels of lipid","lipid metabolism disease","reduced insulin resistance","fat deposits","obese mice","compound C","FAS expressions","AMPK inhibitor","high-fat diet","Institute of Cancer Research","increase","phosphorylation","plasma","Paulownia fortunei flowers","body weight gain","treatment","flavonoid-rich extract","CPT1","activated kinase","level of AMP","SREBP","metabolic-related alterations","glucose","HepG2 cells","serum aminotransferase activity","Male h ICR","prevention of overweight","phosphor-IRS","potential natural candidate","molecular factors","study","HMGCR","obesity","decrease","mechanism","objective","results","weeks"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we identified that isoliquiritigenin (ISL), as one of chemical compositions from the total flavonoids glycyrrhiza (TFG), can significantly enhance \u03B2-glucuronidase activity in vitro. Measurements using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the activity of \u03B2-glucuronidase could be increased by 2.66-fold via the addition of ISL to a \u03B2-glucuronidase solution that contained GL at a 3:10 molar ratio of ISL to GL. ISL was concluded to be an activator because ISL could reduce the K(m) and E(a) of \u03B2-glucuronidase reacting with GL.

We further explore their immune modulatory functions and their involvement in the regulation of inflammatory responses during chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

It poses a serious and growing worldwide public health problem that will only be partially addressed with the introduction of new antiviral therapies. However, these treatments will not prevent re-infection particularly in high risk populations. The introduction of a HCV vaccine has been predicted, using simulation models in a high risk population, to have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of HCV. A vaccine with 50 to 80% efficacy targeted to high-risk intravenous drug users could dramatically reduce HCV incidence in this population. Virus like particles (VLPs) are composed of viral structural proteins which self-assemble into non-infectious particles that lack genetic material and resemble native viruses. Thus, VLPs represent a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able to induce potent adaptive immune responses. Currently, many VLP-based vaccines have entered clinical trials, while licensed VLP vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) have been in use for many years. The HCV core, E1 and E2 proteins can self-assemble into immunogenic VLPs while inclusion of HCV antigens into heterogenous (chimeric) VLPs is also a promising approach. These VLPs are produced using different expression systems such as bacterial, yeast, mammalian, plant, or insect cells. Here, this paper will review HCV VLP-based vaccines and their immunogenicity in animal models as well as the different expression systems used in their production.","publish_time":"2017-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masavuli, Makutiro Ghislain; Wijesundara, Danushka K.; Torresi, Joseph; Gowans, Eric J.; Grubor-Bauk, Branka","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2fbe8d2a00bf0e7041a1b7c9e08c80ef87cb5cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5723323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5723323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV vaccine","incidence of HCV","HCV incidence","HCV core","HCV VLP-based vaccines","immunogenic VLPs","inclusion of HCV antigens","licensed VLP vaccines","hepatitis B virus","Hepatitis C Virus","human papilloma virus","different expression systems","world\u2019s population","high risk populations","immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able","E2 proteins","liver transplantation","animal models","simulation models","non-infectious particles","viral structural proteins","leading cause of liver disease","introduction of new antiviral therapies","HBV","clinical trials","potent adaptive immune responses","high-risk intravenous drug users","mammalian","genetic material","efficacy","re-infection","yeast","E1","immunogenicity","HPV","significant effect","public health problem","insect cells","native viruses","production","paper","promising approach","treatments","years"],"language":"en"},

We performed a pilot cross sectional study to assess the feasibility of gas-capillary column ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS), for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in exhaled breath to diagnose bacterial RTI in hospital inpatients. METHODS: 71 patients were prospectively recruited from the Acute Medical Unit of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital between March and May 2016 and classified as confirmed or probable bacterial or viral RTI on the basis of microbiologic, biochemical and radiologic testing. Breath samples were collected at the patient\u2019s bedside directly into the electronic nose device, which recorded a VOC spectrum for each sample. Sparse principal component analysis and sparse logistic regression were used to develop a diagnostic model to classify VOC spectra as being caused by bacterial or non-bacterial RTI. RESULTS: Summary area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61\u20130.86), summary sensitivity and specificity were 62% (95% CI 41\u201380%) and 80% (95% CI 64\u201391%) respectively (p = 0.00147).

In this review, we describe practical approaches being used to discover functional RNA elements in viral genomes. In addition to success stories in new and emerging viruses, these approaches have revealed some surprising new features of well-studied viruses e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza, and dengue viruses. Some notable discoveries were facilitated by new comparative analyses of diverse viral genome alignments. Importantly, comparative approaches for finding RNA elements embedded in coding and non-coding regions differ. With the exponential growth of computer power we have progressed from stem-loop prediction on single sequences to cutting edge 3D prediction, and from command line to user friendly web interfaces.

Toona sinensis showed potent antiproliferation effect on lung, melatonin, ovary, colon, and liver cancers. However, the effects of the species on osteosarcoma cells are rarely investigated. Results: In this study, we found fraction 1 of Toona sinensis leaf (TSL-1) resulted in inhibition of cell viability in MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines, while it only caused a moderate suppressive effect on normal osteoblasts. In addition, TSL-1 significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase leakage and induced apoptosis and necrosis in Saos-2 cells. TSL-1 increased mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic factor Bad. Most important, TSL-1 significantly suppressed Saos-2 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice by increasing caspase-3. The IC-50 of TSL-1 for the 3 tested osteosarcoma cells is around 1/9 of that for lung cancer cells. Conclusion: We demonstrated that TSL-1, a fractionated extract from TSL, caused significant cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cells due to apoptosis. In vivo xenograft study showed that TSL-1 suppressed the growth of osteosarcoma cells at least in part by inducing apoptosis.

Using an unbiased search, we analyzed the epigenetic changes at DNA methylation and post-translational histone modification levels induced by the infection. DNA methylation was unaltered, while we found a general decrease on histone acetylation, which correlates with transcriptional inactivation and may cooperate with the impairment of cellular transcription that causes influenza virus infection. A particular increase in H3K79 methylation was observed and the use of an inhibitor of the specific H3K79 methylase, Dot1L enzyme, or its silencing, increased influenza virus replication. The antiviral response was reduced in conditions of Dot1L downregulation, since decreased nuclear translocation of NF-kB complex, and IFN-\u03B2, Mx1 and ISG56 expression was detected. The data suggested a control of antiviral signaling by methylation of H3K79 and consequently, influenza virus replication was unaffected in IFN pathway-compromised, Dot1L-inhibited cells. H3K79 methylation also controlled replication of another potent interferon-inducing virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus, but did not modify amplification of respiratory syncytial virus that poorly induces interferon signaling. Epigenetic methylation of H3K79 might have an important role in controlling interferon-induced signaling against viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcos-Villar, Laura; D\u00EDaz-Colunga, Juan; Sandoval, Juan; Zamarre\u00F1o, Noelia; Landeras-Bueno, Sara; Esteller, Manel; Falc\u00F3n, Ana; Nieto, Amelia","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35f89b8e3ddf5b85ff55314dd423adf1019ac410.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5775356.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H3K79 methylation","influenza virus infection","Epigenetic methylation of H3K79","network of virus","increased influenza virus replication","DNA methylation","vesicular stomatitis virus","amplification of respiratory syncytial virus","specific H3K79 methylase","Dot1L enzyme","epigenetic changes","potent interferon","epigenetic modifications","conditions of Dot1L downregulation","Dot1L-inhibited cells","IFN pathway","histone acetylation","IFN-\u03B2","antiviral response","control of antiviral","post-translational histone modification levels","silencing","complex","host functional interactions","nuclear translocation of NF","impairment of cellular transcription","chromatin dynamic","Mx1","inhibitor","use","ISG56 expression","general decrease","important role","transcriptional inactivation","particular increase","unbiased search","data","viral pathogens"],"language":"en"},

In such non-transplant patients, monitoring for adenovirus in the blood is not routine. However, with adenoviruses, when there is a more peripheral (i.e. non-blood) site of infection such as the chest, serial adenovirus monitoring in blood for the duration of that illness may be warranted. CASE PRESENTATION: This case started with an initial bacterial chest infection that responded to treatment, followed by an adenovirus pneumonitis that disseminated to his blood a week later with levels of up to 92 million adenovirus DNA copies/ml. Despite prompt treatment with cidofovir, his respiratory function continued to deteriorate over the next two weeks and he was moved to intensive care. Intravenous immunoglobulin and ribavirin were subsequently added to his treatment. However, he died soon after this with a final adenovirus load of 20 million copies/ml in his blood. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that even in non-transplant haematology patients, where such patients present with an acute respiratory adenovirus infection, teams should consider checking the blood for adenovirus to check for signs of disseminated infection. The earlier this can be tested, the earlier treatment can be initiated (if adenovirus positive), which may produce more successful clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2018-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joffe, Michael; Wagner, Simon D.; Tang, Julian W.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/289edbe9e28f26ea1d2de597c085e0f6e3009aed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5787257.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5787257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adenovirus pneumonitis","adenovirus positive","non-blood","acute respiratory adenovirus infection","fatal case of disseminated adenovirus infection","adenovirus DNA copies","serial adenovirus monitoring","final adenovirus load","non-transplant patients","non-transplant haematology patients","site of infection","signs of disseminated infection","earlier treatment","prompt treatment","initial bacterial chest infection","non-transplant haematology adult patient","respiratory symptoms","respiratory function","CASE PRESENTATION","chronic lymphocytic leukaemia","combination chemoimmunotherapy","teams","months","cidofovir","duration","ribavirin","levels","successful clinical outcomes","Intravenous immunoglobulin","BACKGROUND","illness","intensive care","weeks","adenoviruses","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Important successes have been obtained in protecting individuals against many deleterious pathological situations after parenteral vaccination. However, one of the major limitations of the current vaccination strategies is the administration route that may not be optimal for the induction of immunity at the site of pathogen entry, i.e., mucosal surfaces. It is now well documented that immune responses along the genital, respiratory, or gastrointestinal tracts have to be elicited locally to ensure efficient trafficking of effector and memory B and T cells to mucosal tissues. Moreover, needle-free mucosal delivery of vaccines is advantageous in terms of safety, compliance, and ease of administration. However, the quest for mucosal vaccines is challenging due to (1) the fact that Ag sampling has to be performed across the epithelium through a relatively limited number of portals of entry; (2) the deleterious acidic and proteolytic environment of the mucosae that affect the stability, integrity, and retention time of the applied Ags; and (3) the tolerogenic environment of mucosae, which requires the addition of adjuvants to elicit efficient effector immune responses. Until now, only few mucosally applicable vaccine formulations have been developed and successfully tested. In animal models and clinical trials, the use of lipidic structures such as liposomes, virosomes, immune stimulating complexes, gas-filled microbubbles and emulsions has proven efficient for the mucosal delivery of associated Ags and the induction of local and systemic immune reponses. Such particles are suitable for mucosal delivery because they protect the associated payload from degradation and deliver concentrated amounts of Ags via specialized sampling cells (microfold cells) within the mucosal epithelium to underlying antigen-presenting cells. The review aims at summarizing recent development in the field of mucosal vaccination using lipid-based particles. The modularity ensured by tailoring the lipidic design and content of particles, and their known safety as already established in humans, make the continuing appraisal of these vaccine candidates a promising development in the field of targeted mucosal vaccination.","publish_time":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corth\u00E9sy, Blaise; Bioley, Gilles","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64b4ec9158c8f378000f3d15492f317f19baeafb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5845866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845866/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ags"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucosal vaccines","mucosal epithelium","field of mucosal vaccination","mucosal tissues","mucosal surfaces","mucosal delivery of associated Ags","field of targeted mucosal vaccination","needle-free mucosal delivery of vaccines","T cells","efficient effector immune responses","parenteral vaccination","microfold cells","specialized sampling cells","current vaccination strategies","T cell responses","order","immune stimulating complexes","efficient trafficking of effector","applied Ags","systemic immune reponses","Ag sampling","content of particles","concentrated amounts of Ags","lipid-based particles","tolerogenic environment of mucosae","promising development","induction of local","associated payload","induction of immunity","lipidic design","vaccine candidates","terms of safety","harness antigen","known safety","administration route","immunogenic formulations","mucosally applicable vaccine formulations","ease of administration","proteolytic environment","use of lipidic structures","summarizing recent development","deleterious pathological situations","site of pathogen entry","memory B","liposomes","virosomes","specific antibody","genital","clinical trials","retention time","microbubbles","compliance","degradation","continuing appraisal","addition of adjuvants","humans","individuals","stability","integrity","major limitations","process","emulsions","limited number of portals","animal models","gastrointestinal tracts","review","modularity","fact","infections","quest","Important successes"],"language":"en"},

In this study, various trends associated with synonymous codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes were investigated, and the results are reported. Identification of factors that influence codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes was done using various codon usage indices, such as the relative synonymous codon usage, the effective number of codons, and the codon adaptation index. The Spearman rank correlation analysis and a correspondence analysis were used for correlating various factors with codon usage. The results revealed that mutational pressure due to compositional constraints, gene expression level, and selection at the codon level for utilization of putative optimal codons are major factors influencing synonymous codon usage bias in monkeypox viral genomes. A cluster analysis of relative synonymous codon usage values revealed a grouping of more virulent strains as one major cluster (Central African strains) and a grouping of less virulent strains (West African strains) as another major cluster, indicating a relationship between virulence and synonymous codon usage bias. This study concluded that a balance between the mutational pressure acting at the base composition level and the selection pressure acting at the amino acid level frames synonymous codon usage bias in the chosen monkeypox viruses.

We conducted an investigation to verify the existence of an outbreak and to identify the disease nature, mode of transmission and risk factors. METHODS: We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis between 1 June 2015 and 15 October 2015 in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or neighbouring districts. We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed case-patients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (\u00B1 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. RESULTS: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness. In the case-control study, 42% (5/12) of cases vs. 0.0% (0/77) of controls had liver disease (OR(M-H) = \u221E; 95%CI = 3.7-\u221E); 71% (10/14) of cases vs. 35% (28/81) of controls had ulcer disease (OR(M-H) = 13; 95% CI = 1.6-98); 27% (3/11) of cases vs. 14% (11/81) of controls used indomethacin prior to disease onset (OR(M-H) = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.0-36). None of the blood samples were positive for any of the VHFs. CONCLUSION: This reported cluster of hematemesis illness was due to predisposing conditions and use of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). Health education should be conducted on the danger of NSAIDs misuse, especially in persons with pre-disposing conditions.","publish_time":"2017-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kabwama, Steven Ndugwa; Mafigiri, Richardson; Balinandi, Stephen; Kagirita, Atek; Riolexus, Alex Ario; Zhu, Bao-Ping","journal":"Pan Afr Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/820acf55c4e52411482f6eb44360ffa35288b89a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5878846.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878846/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Buliisa District Health Office","Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","controls","case-patients","disease onset","case-control study","persons","Buliisa District Health Office","Hoima District","suspected case","years of age","disease nature","onset of hematemesis","Health education","liver disease","ulcer disease","health-care workers","age-specific attack rate","Uganda Ministry of Health","resident of Hoima","matched study design","cluster of hematemesis illness","predisposing conditions","possible exposures","pre-disposing conditions","multiple deaths","descriptive epidemiology","haemorrhage","Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs","mode of transmission","Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers","hypotheses","Mantel-Haenszel method","risk factors","neighbouring districts","danger of NSAIDs misuse","data","sex","outbreak","biological specimens","indomethacin","village of residence","medical records","existence","blood samples","CONCLUSION","METHODS","investigation","VHFs","community","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

Our analyses reveal that ZUFSP is a novel DUB with no homology to any known DUBs, leading us to classify ZUFSP as the seventh DUB family. Intriguingly, the minimal catalytic domain does not cleave polyubiquitin. We identify two ubiquitin binding domains in ZUFSP: a ZHA (ZUFSP helical arm) that binds to the distal ubiquitin and an atypical UBZ domain in ZUFSP that binds to polyubiquitin. Importantly, both domains are essential for ZUFSP to selectively cleave K63-linked polyubiquitin. We show that ZUFSP localizes to DNA lesions, where it plays an important role in genome stability pathways, functioning to prevent spontaneous DNA damage and also promote cellular survival in response to exogenous DNA damage.","publish_time":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwasna, Dominika; Abdul Rehman, Syed Arif; Natarajan, Jayaprakash; Matthews, Stephen; Madden, Ross; De Cesare, Virginia; Weidlich, Simone; Virdee, Satpal; Ahel, Ivan; Gibbs-Seymour, Ian; Kulathu, Yogesh","journal":"Mol Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e4ac3a8108d17c0034aa38040a99be38819c12e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5896202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZUFSP helical arm","distal ubiquitin","High-resolution crystal structures of ZUFSP","important regulators of ubiquitin","ubiquitin binding domains","distinctive features of ubiquitin recognition","spontaneous DNA damage","exogenous DNA damage","DNA lesions","K63-linked polyubiquitin","important role","Deubiquitinating enzymes","known DUBs","novel DUB","DUB family","atypical UBZ domain","minimal catalytic domain","discovery of deubiquitinating activity","cellular survival","complex","ZHA","genome stability pathways","response","homology","catalysis","C6orf113","analyses"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory disorders in COVID-19 caused by the virus commonly present as viral pneumonia-like opacities in chest X-ray images which are used as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. The surge places high demand on medical services including radiology expertise. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based automated decision support tools to alleviate radiological burden. We address this insufficiency by expanding training data distribution through use of weakly-labeled images pooled from publicly available CXR collections showing pneumonia-related opacities. We use the images in a stage-wise, strategic approach and train convolutional neural network-based algorithms to detect COVID-19 infections in CXRs. It is observed that weakly-labeled data augmentation improves performance with the baseline test data compared to non-augmented training by expanding the learned feature space to encompass variability in the unseen test distribution to enhance inter-class discrimination, reduce intra-class similarity and generalization error. Augmentation with COVID-19 CXRs from individual collections significantly improves performance compared to baseline non-augmented training and weakly-labeled augmentation toward detecting COVID-19 like viral pneumonia in the publicly available COVID-19 CXR collections. This underscores the fact that COVID-19 CXRs have a distinct pattern and hence distribution, unlike non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia and other infectious agents.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajaraman, S.; Antani, S.

As comorbidity increases with age, it is necessary to understand the age-adjusted relationship between comorbidity and COVID-19 outcomes, in order to enhance planning capabilities and our understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid, comprehensive review of the literature up to 10 April 2020, to assess the international empirical evidence on the association between comorbidities and severe or critical care outcomes of COVID-19, after accounting for age, among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Results: After screening 579 studies, we identified seven studies eligible for inclusion and these were synthesised narratively. All were from China. The emerging evidence base mostly indicates that after adjustment for age (and in some cases other potential confounders), obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), and cancer are all associated with worse outcomes. The largest study, using a large nationwide sample of COVID-19 patients in China, found that those with multiple comorbidities had more than twice the risk of a severe outcome or death compared with patients with no comorbidities, after adjusting for age and smoking (HR=2.59, 95% CI 1.61, 4.17). Conclusions: This review summarises for clinicians, policymakers, and academics the most robust evidence to date on this topic, to inform the management of patients and control measures for tackling the pandemic. Given the intersection of comorbidity with ethnicity and social disadvantage, these findings also have important implications for health inequalities. As the pandemic develops, further research should confirm these trends in other settings outside China and explore mechanisms by which various underlying health conditions increase risk of severe COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mason, K.

Disruptions in the drug market are expected and shortages might worsen. Community pharmacies can contribute to early identification and report of medicines\u2019 supply and demand issues. Objective The aim of this study is to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on outpatient medicines\u2019 sales and shortages. Methods A retrospective, time-trend analysis of medicine sales, shortages and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases was performed from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and its homologous period (regarding sales only). A detailed analysis of 6 pharmaceutical substances was performed. All data were subjected to rescaling using the min-max normalization method, in order to become comparable. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft\u00AE Excel. Results The pandemic resulted in an increase in medicines\u2019 demand and reported shortages during the early stage of the outbreak. The maximum proportion of medicine sales was registered on March 13th, 2020, 4 days after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By the end of March, sales have already dropped to proportions similar to those of 2019. The maximum proportion of drug shortages was reached about one week after the sales peak and by the end of the study period were below those recorded in the pre-COVID-19 period. The analyzed drugs were paracetamol, ascorbic acid, dapagliflozin plus metformin, rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe, formoterol, and hydroxychloroquine, as these pharmaceutical substances registered the highest growth rate in sales and shortages when compared to the same period in the previous year. Hydroxychloroquine showed the most different pattern trends on sales and shortages of these medicines. Conclusions Pharmacies can provide timely and real-world data regarding sales and shortages. The adopted measures to guarantee the continuous supply of the medicine market seem to have worked. The long-term impacts of this pandemic are unknown and should continue to be closely monitored.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romano, S\u00F3nia; Galante, Helo\u00EDsa; Figueira, D\u00E9bora; Mendes, Zilda; Rodrigues, Ant\u00F3nio Teixeira","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58b1f0c4f27ad2ff06700a14cc2adafe6ae94c48.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120306112; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120306112?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sales peak","reported shortages","outpatient medicines\u2019 sales","maximum proportion of medicine sales","maximum proportion of drug shortages","time-trend analysis of medicine sales","Data analysis","pre-COVID","study period","pandemic","medicines\u2019 demand","medicine market","homologous period","Abstract Background COVID","report of medicines\u2019 supply","pharmaceutical substances","outbreak","detailed analysis","hydroxychloroquine","real-world data","drug market","early identification","continuous supply","early stage","demand issues","Conclusions Pharmacies","Community pharmacies","ascorbic acid","metformin","dapagliflozin","highest growth rate","paracetamol","rosuvastatin","ezetimibe","different pattern trends","increase","laboratory","order","max normalization method","analyzed drugs","formoterol","retrospective","week","worldwide public health concern","Methods","adopted measures","long-term impacts","rescaling","Microsoft","Objective","aim","Excel","previous year","Disruptions","cases","proportions similar","days"],"language":"en"},

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient).

Current study focused on whether climatic conditions(temperature and relative humidity)are having any influence in the occurrence of COVID-19 when the outbreak has been classified as pandemic. To determine the effect of daily average temperature and average relative humidity on log-transformed total daily cases of COVID-19, polynomial regression as a quadratic term and linear regression were done.

The criterion for the recovered patients is assumed by COVID-19 nucleic acid testing negative. The mathematical model is constructed by retrospective study.

The data cover the date when the epidemic situation is reported and the data showed that the epidemic situation is almost under control in China. The mathematical model mainly simulates the active cases and the deaths during the outbreak of COVID-19. Then apply the mathematical model to simulate the epidemic situations in Italy and Spain, which are suffering the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. The determination of the parameters for the 2 European countries is based on the data supplied by Worldometers.

We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This single-center, retrospective, and observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People\u0027s Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Demographic information, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and eight patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. Findings: All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all eight severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; four received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all eight in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; two received linezolid). Moreover, seven patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and nine (16.36%) with immunomodulators. Interpretation: Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, L.; Liu, C.; Li, N.; Liu, H.; Gu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Chen, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c503a0a09da3a0697ecbc8bada8bd2b369e309a8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.28.20045955v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Shenyang Sixth People"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe-group patients","median treatment","days","mild symptoms","mild group","severe symptoms","severe group","received lopinavir","treatment processes","COVID","received linezolid","Administered drugs","ritonavir","intervention times","administered medications","umifenovir","early administration of antiviral drugs","Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics","antiviral therapy","use of glucocorticoids","laboratory indicators","recovery rate","observational study","virus","SARS-CoV","single-center","retrospective","Demographic information","specific medication","emerging disease","clinical outcomes","risk of co-infection","Shenyang","People\u0027s Hospital","date","Methods","Interpretation","Background","moxifloxacin","Findings","immunomodulators"],"language":"en"},

Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020 were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse-probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed. Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p\u003C0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p\u003C0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p\u003C0.001). Conclusion: Extra care and early medical intervention are needed for patients with pre-existing comorbidities, especially CHD.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Tian; Chu, Qiao; Yu, Zhangsheng; Fa, Botao; Li, Anqi; Xu, Lei; Wu, Ruijun; He, Yaping","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eef3e54141bee3b79b85ecfbf7acd1c0b0d7f067.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041848","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["risk of pre-existing comorbidities","pre-existing CHD","estimated mortality risk","increased risk of mortality","mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities","death risk of COVID","increased death risk","higher risk of death","History of comorbidities","additional pre-existing comorbidity","patients","early treatment","Older age","China","controls","cases","CI","early medical intervention","inverse-probability","coronavirus disease","day survival probability","novel human coronavirus","nested case-control design","profile patient","weighted Cox proportional hazard model","locations","Extra care","outbreak","reported deaths","Hubei Province","study","SARS-CoV","Conclusion","limited evidence","year-old female","times","year increase","important implications","gender","total","Method","Background","clinical suggestions","Results","Objective","worldwide pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui, H.; Zhang, Y.; Yang, X.; Wang, X.; He, B.; Li, L.; Li, H.; Tian, J.; Chen, Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecb98e01fbedbca627a1b015ff962ea37c5302c3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.24.20027052v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["critical patients","mild patients","cardiac injury of COVID","cardiac inflammation of COVID","different COVID","heart functions of COVID","critical group","critical cases","abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics","high risk factors of cardiac injury","light","peak heart rates","peak value of TnI","clinical characteristics","CT scan","normal value","single-center study","National Health Commission of China","consecutive corona virus disease","density","onset of atrial fibrillation","type","hypertension","CAD","correlation","potential interventions","diabetes mellites","imaging of epicardial adipose tissue","guidance","retrospective","Beijing Youan Hospital","fold","underlying complications","tumor","monitoring","pneumonia","Methods","bpm","Conclusion","ResultsOf","deaths","fatality","Objective"],"language":"en"},

There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral activity is through drug repurposing. Numerous drugs are already approved for human use and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that also inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that 17 of these inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a range of IC50 values at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We directly follow up with seven of these to demonstrate all are capable of inhibiting infectious SARS-CoV-2 production.

Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilator -- so-called \u0027vent splitting\u0027. Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T-pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters -- sometimes made using 3D printing technologies -- have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID-19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively \u0027off the shelf\u0027 materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in-line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure-control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients. However, given the novelty and potential utility of this approach, we deemed it appropriate to provide this information to the broader critical care community at the present time. In coming days and weeks, we will continue to characterize and refine this approach, using large animal models and proof-of-principle human studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raredon, M.

Conclusion Whilst these results are susceptible to residual confounding, they do provide ecological level support to the individual level studies that found face mask usage to reduce the transmission and acquisition of respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kenyon, Chris","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ef0df1127178cb56f40a4e4fcb6a39b82df6730.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048652","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","South Korea","Thailand","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["use of face masks","population level usage of face masks","face mask usage","national promotion of face masks","country level","Individual level studies","associated SARS CoV2","multivariate analysis face mask use","ecological level support","transmission","public","inhabitant","countries","COVID19 diagnoses","SARS CoV1","COVID19 epidemic","SARS CoV2 epidemics","number of COVID19 cases","testing intensity","Results","coef","acquisition of respiratory viral infections","range of respiratory viruses","Singapore","Japan","Hong Kong","Czechia","sizes","China","South Korea","residual confounding","available data","Thailand","large differences","linear regression","association","Malaysia","reasons","Methods","binary variable","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Sweden Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016 Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register. Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic. Results can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning. This information is crucial when deciding appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic and reduce both the direct mortality burden from the disease itself, and the indirect mortality burden from potentially overwhelmed health systems.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gemes, Katalin; Talback, Mats; Modig, Karin; Ahlbom, Anders; Berglund, Anita; Feychting, Maria; Matthews, Anthony","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8d4cfa7284b613f9b41bb55c6f7f764b9a1f8c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057919","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cancer Register"],"locations":["Sweden","Stockholm"],"keyphrases":["individuals","cardiovascular disease","prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID","Disease Prevention","underlying assumptions of disease burden","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","severe asthma","indirect mortality burden","county specific prevalence","Cancer Register","study population","prevalence of underlying medical conditions","Sweden Participants","years","planning","Results","Prescribed Drug Register","Outpatient Specialist Care Register","Cross sectional study Setting","county level","ongoing pandemic","World Health Organization","Swedish National Inpatient","overwhelmed health systems","European Centre","Control","modelling efforts","age","Main outcome measures","appropriate strategies","healthcare resources","Design","guidelines","authorities","information","diabetes","records","Conclusions","Stockholm","Objectives","Kalmar"],"language":"en"},

Because the clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province were reported for the first time on February 13, 2020, a very high peak of new cases in China was observed. The reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear. Methods: All data of new cases in China were acquired from WHO situation reports. Linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. Primer-BLAST and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers. Expression data of human mRNA in different tissues was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Finding: Based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases, it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province. There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19. Among them, a pair of primer for the ORF1ab regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which widely applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, well matched some human mRNAs such as Cathepsin C transcripts. Compared to other transcripts, Cathepsin C mRNA had a high abundance in tonsil, lung and small intestine. Interpretation: Some non-specific RT-PCR primers could cause the serious interference during RT-PCR amplification so as to increase the risk of false-negative diagnoses for COVID-19 infections.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a recent zoonotic infection that has quickly reached pandemic spread2,3. Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses is thought to occur in the absence of pre-existing immunity in the target human population. Using diverse assays for detection of antibodies reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein, we demonstrate the presence of pre-existing immunity in uninfected and unexposed humans to the new coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies, exclusively of the IgG class, were readily detectable by a sensitive flow cytometry-based method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals with recent HCoV infection and targeted the S2 subunit. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, as well as concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies throughout the observation period of 6 weeks since symptoms onset. HCoV patient sera also variably reacted with SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleocapsid (N), but not with the S1 subunit or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S on standard enzyme immunoassays. Notably, HCoV patient sera exhibited specific neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes, according to levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera. Distinguishing pre-existing and de novo antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for serology, seroprevalence and vaccine studies, as well as for our understanding of susceptibility to and natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Kevin; Faulkner, Nikhil; Cornish, Georgina; Rosa, Annachiara; Earl, Christopher; Wrobel, Antoni; Benton, Donald; Roustan, Chloe; Bolland, William; Thompson, Rachael; Agua-Doce, Ana; Hobson, Philip; Heaney, Judith; Rickman, Hannah; Paraskevopoulou, Stavroula; Houlihan, Catherine F.; Thomson, Kirsty; Sanchez, Emilie; Shin, Gee Yen; Spyer, Moira J; Walker, Philip A.; Kjaer, Svend; Riddell, Andrew; Beale, Rupert; Swanton, Charles; Gandhi, Sonia; Stockinger, Brigitta; Gamblin, Steve; McCoy, Laura E.; Cherepanov, Peter; Nastouli, Eleni; Kassiotis, George","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16628740b589b40151d313b7df827126564a391d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.095414","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","levels of SARS","S-reactive antibodies","natural course of SARS","higher titres of SARS","S-reactive IgG antibodies","S-binding IgG","S pseudotypes","recent HCoV infection","HCoV patient sera","detection of antibodies reactive","recent zoonotic infection","IgA antibodies","presence of pre-existing immunity","target human population","Distinguishing pre-existing","absence of pre-existing immunity","new coronavirus","IgG class","related human coronaviruses","COVID","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","uninfected individuals","etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease","S1 subunit","S2 subunit","Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses","receptor binding domain","mild respiratory infections1","specific neutralising activity","observation period","RBD","unexposed humans","novo antibody responses","sensitive flow cytometry-based method","HCoVs","concomitant IgM","efficiencies comparable","serology","seroprevalence","weeks","diverse assays","Spike","standard enzyme immunoassays","vaccine studies","symptoms onset","understanding of susceptibility","glycoprotein","nucleocapsid","pandemic spread2","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, in the HEA mechanism, we weight the context information based on the semantic similarities and time intervals between each TSC and its context, thereby considering influences of the herding effect in the model.

There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 using human disease-relevant cells to understand key features of virus biology and facilitate drug screening. As primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory-based, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be adapted for drug screens. The lung organoids, particularly aveolar type II cells, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a robust induction of chemokines and cytokines with little type I/III interferon signaling, similar to that observed amongst human COVID-19 pulmonary infections. We performed a high throughput screen using hPSC-derived lung organoids and identified FDA-approved drug candidates, including imatinib and mycophenolic acid, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pre- or post-treatment with these drugs at physiologically relevant levels decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived lung organoids. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-derived lung cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 can model human COVID-19 disease and provide a valuable resource to screen for FDA-approved drugs that might be repurposed and should be considered for COVID-19 clinical trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Yuling; Yang, Liuliu; Duan, Xiaohua; Duan, Fuyu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Yaron, Tomer M.; Wang, Pengfei; Tang, Xuming; Zhang, Tuo; Zhao, Zeping; Bram, Yaron; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Nguyen, Duc; Xu, Dong; Wang, Xing; Uhl, Skyler; Huang, Yaoxing; Johnson, Jared L.; Xiang, Jenny; Wang, Hui; Pan, Fong Cheng; Cantley, Lewis C.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Ho, David D.; Evans, Todd; Schwartz, Robert E.; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Chen, Shuibing","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa2dfb1bad9aa849fded4324ecff9f3ba99184be.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study SARS-CoV","primary SARS-CoV","inhibitors of SARS","human COVID","hPSC-derived lung cells","hPSC-derived lung organoids","infection of hPSC","human disease-relevant cells","lung organoid model","human pluripotent stem cells","FDA-approved drug candidates","FDA-approved drugs","drug screening","drug screens","aveolar type","little type","relevant levels","high throughput screen","key features of virus biology","imatinib","novel models","express ACE2","mycophenolic acid","robust induction of chemokines","cytokines","hPSCs","urgent need","post-treatment","valuable resource","interferon","pulmonary infections","Transcriptomic analysis","data","clinical trials","cases","deaths","entry"],"language":"en"},

In Brazil by the end of April 2020, another 110 thousand cases and 5,000 deaths had been confirmed. The scarcity of laboratory resources and overload of the care network, added to the broad clinical spectrum of the disease, can make it difficult to capture all mortality from this disease through epidemiological surveillance based on individual notification of cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the excess of deaths in Brazilian capitals with the highest incidence of COVID-19, as a way of validating the method, we also evaluated a capital with low incidence. We assessed weekly mortality from all causes during the year 2020, up to the epidemiological week 17, compared with the previous year. The data were obtained through the National Civil Registry Information Center (CNIRC, acronym in Portuguese). We estimate the expected mortality and the 95% confidence interval by projecting the observed mortality in 2019 for the population of 2020. In the five capitals with the highest incidences it was possible to identify excess deaths in the pandemic period, the age group most affected were those over 60 years old, 31% of the excess deaths occurred in the population between 20 and 59 years old. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between the excess of deaths in each city and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological surveillance. There was no excess of deaths in the capital with the lowest incidence, nor among the population under 20 years old. We estimate that epidemiological surveillance managed to capture only 52% of all mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities studied. Considering the simplicity of the method, its low cost and reliability for assessing the real burden of the disease, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic should be widely used as a complementary tool to regular epidemiological surveillance and its use should be encouraged by WHO.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freitas, A.

Transmission of Variola is by respiratory droplets, and MVA delivered by skin scarification (s.s.) protected mice far more effectively against lethal respiratory challenge with VACV than any other route of delivery, and at much lower doses. Comparisons of s.s. with intradermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular routes showed that MVAOVA s.s.-generated T cells were both more abundant and transcriptionally distinct. MVAOVA s.s. produced greater numbers of lung Ova-specific CD8\u002B TRM and was superior in protecting mice against lethal VACVOVA respiratory challenge. Nearly as many lung TRM were generated with MVAOVA s.s. compared to direct pulmonary immunization with MVAOVA, and both routes vaccination protected mice against lethal pulmonary challenge with VACVOVA. Strikingly, MVAOVA s.s.-generated effector T cells exhibited overlapping gene transcriptional profiles to those generated via direct pulmonary immunization. Overall, our data suggest that heterologous MVA vectors delivered via s.s. are uniquely well-suited as vaccine vectors for respiratory pathogens like COVID-19.

The concentration of the antibodies on day 16-21 is not correlated with the course or outcome of the disease (Spearman r \u003C 0.20, P \u003E 0.05). Nasopharyngeal swabs revealed positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in up to 52.7% of recovered patients after discharge, whose IgG proved to be significantly lower than that of those with negative RNA results (P = 0.009). IgG and IgM were tested twice within 14 days after discharge with a 7-day interval, and the second testing of these antibodies displayed a decrease in concentration of 21.2% (IQR, 11.2%34.48%) for IgG and 23.05% (IQR, -27.96%46.13%) for IgM, without statistical significance between the patients with re-detectable positive RNA results and those with negative RNA results after discharge. However, those with positive results experienced a count decrease in lymphocyte subsets. Interpretation: The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19-21 after symptom onset, and antibody testing on day 16-21 is associated with increased detection rates, but the antibody concentration does not affect the course and outcome of the infection. Recovering patients with re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA displayed lower concentration of IgG, but the downward trend of IgG during recovery indicated its limited duration of protection, and the protective effect of IgG remains to be investigated.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Q.; Cui, X.; Liu, X.; Peng, B.; Jiang, J.; Wang, X.; Li, Y.; Hu, W.; Ao, Z.; Duan, J.; Zhu, L.; Guo, S.; Wu, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68c9c407f9ff722f6b28052910f915cad6eeca44.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20065953v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["S/CO"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["IgG antibodies","lower concentration of IgG","concentration of SARS","higher concentration of IgG","downward trend of IgG","protective effect of IgG","positive results","re-detectable positive SARS-CoV","infection of SARS","antibody concentration","negative RNA results","discharge","day interval","IQR","re-detectable positive RNA results","production of specific IgM","Test results","ill patients","recovered patients","course","antibody testing","symptom onset","moderate disease","outcome","recurrence of positive nucleic acid tests","increased detection rates","count decrease","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recovery","Background","limited duration of protection","outburst of pneumonia cases","statistical significance","confirmed COVID","Wuhan","pathology","Spearman r","Nasopharyngeal swabs","lymphocyte subsets","China","diagnosis","implication","median","Methods","novel betacoronavirus","chemiluminescence method","Findings","days","Interpretation","clinical data","various subgroups"],"language":"en"},

The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited. Methods In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level. Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results. Conclusions Based on these findings, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Mei; Lin, Bing-peng; Gao, Hong-bin; Young, Andrew J; Wang, Xin-hong; Liu, Chang; Wu, Kai-bin; Liu, Ming-xiao; Chen, Jian-ming; Huang, Jiang-yong; Lee, Learn-han; Qi, Cui-ling; Ge, Lin-hu; Wang, Li-jing","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed532cfdb251b5bb5c2e121ce67f438d82616c8e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.047951","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FURIN","IHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2-positive cells","expression of FURIN","FURIN-positive cells","SARS-CoV","oral tissues","proportion of FURIN","FURIN enzyme","FURIN protease","FURIN activity","differential expression of ACE2","ACE2 receptor binding domain","oral mucosal cells","oral mucosa tissues","entry of SARS","oral cavity","epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues","host cells","target tissues","bioinformatics results","zoonotic transmission of SARS","fusion domains","cell membranes","new coronavirus entry","potential infective channel of new coronavirus","potential target organ","public single-cell sequence datasets","domain necessary","functional domains","epithelial layers","virus-prevention strategy","possible routes","clinical care","airway epithelia","sustained epidemic spread","ARDS","cardiac tissue","acute respiratory distress syndrome","confirmed human infections","valuable information","sepsis","enteric canals","order","addition","key factor","challenges","deaths","Background","daily life","fibroblasts","protein level","immunohistochemical staining experiment","patient\u2019s treatment","Methods","findings","COVID","IHC experiments","report","S-glycoprotein","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wildtype virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors - which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines - induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wildtype virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific T cells responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus as well as a hemagglutinin-specific T cell response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a several-fold enhancement of this immune response. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and of activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above hypothesis as well as suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.","publish_time":"2018-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bloom, David C.; Tran, Robert K.; Feller, Joyce; Voellmy, Richard","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8c20de511315b496cb114176d47a01f4959787b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/299230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["limited virus replication","efficient pathogen replication","vigorous replication","Replication-competent controlled virus vectors","Single activation of viral replication","unactivated vectors","context of efficient transient vector replication","replication-essential genes","Unactivated viral vectors","wildtype virus challenge","activating time-limited replication","mice of efficient","replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector","equine influenza virus hemagglutinin","localized activation","efficient vaccination","Immunization of mice","balanced immune response","absence of activation","site of administration","recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus","protective immune responses","hemagglutinin-specific T cell response","stringent control","detectable protection","specific T cells responses","gene switch","wildtype strain","administration region","immunogenicity","transient heat treatment","expressed heterologous antigen","virulent HSV","neutralizing antibody","localized application","infected cells","conventional vaccines","complete protection","uncompromised safety","necessary safety","equivalents of inactivated vaccines","presence of systemic antiprogestin results","mouse footpad lethal challenge model","prevention","lethality","rear footpads","mitigation of infectious diseases","novel agents worth","fold enhancement","inactivation","efficacy","syn","attenuation","immunocompromised patients","pathology","IMPORTANCE","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course.

The anticoagulant actions of nebulised heparin limit fibrin deposition and progression of lung injury. Serendipitously, unfractionated heparin also inactivates the SARS CoV 2 virus and prevents its entry into mammalian cells. Nebulisation of heparin may therefore limit both fibrin mediated lung injury and inhibit pulmonary infection by SARS CoV 2. For these reasons we have initiated a multicentre international trial of nebulised heparin in patients with COVID 19.

In silico modeling shows Nelfinavir binds the SARS-CoV-2 main protease consistent with its inhibition of viral replication, whilst Cepharanthine inhibits viral attachment and entry into cells. Consistent with their different modes of action, in vitro assays highlight a synergistic effect of this combined treatment to limit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation.

Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre-existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhattacharyya, Chandrika; Das, Chitrarpita; Ghosh, Arnab; Singh, Animesh K.; Mukherjee, Souvik; Majumder, Partha P.; Basu, Analabha; Biswas, Nidhan K.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.075911","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","East Asians","Europe","North","North America","East Asia"],"keyphrases":["variant delC allele","G spike protein","G mutated Spike protein","cis-eQTL site","expression of TMPRSS2","cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2","particular subtype","SARS-CoV","cleavage site","neutrophil Elastase","IRF1 activator","host cells","known variant site","MX1 host proteins","Elastase serine proteases","rs35074065 overlaps","IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1","D614G mutation","viral entry","North Americans","IRF2 repressor","spread","additional serine protease","nearby gene MX1","neutrophil infiltration","simultaneous processing","East Asians","pre-existing subtypes","S1-S2 junction","transcription factor","Glycine","Aspartate","Europeans","position","overexpression","pandemic","higher frequency","major human tragedy","single nucleotide deletion","activation","COVID","months","China","individual","repression","people"],"language":"en"},

Clear data about the pandemic\u0027s impact is lacking, namely regarding mortality. This work aims to study the impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of all-cause mortality data made available by different European countries, and to critique their mortality surveillance data. METHODS European countries that had publicly available data about the number of deaths per day/week were selected (England and Wales, France, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal). Two different methods were selected to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID19: (DEV) deviation from the expected value from homologue periods, and (RSTS) remainder after seasonal time series decomposition. We estimate total, age- and gender-specific excess mortality. Furthermore, we compare different policy responses to COVID-19. RESULTS Excess mortality was found in all 5 countries, ranging from 10.6% in Portugal (DEV) to 98.5% in Italy (DEV). Furthermore, excess mortality is higher than COVID-attributed deaths in all 5 countries. DISCUSSION The impact of COVID-19 on mortality appears to be larger than officially attributed deaths, in varying degrees in different countries. Comparisons between countries would be useful, but large disparities in mortality surveillance data could not be overcome. Unreliable data, and even a lack of cause-specific mortality data undermine the understanding of the impact of policy choices on both direct and indirect deaths during COVID-19. European countries should invest more on mortality surveillance systems to improve the publicly available data.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Felix-Cardoso, J.; Vasconcelos, H.; Rodrigues, P.; Cruz-Correia, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eef887b2a8d3151f639c6d5ca6d48efde2256bce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20083147v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Wales","France","Netherlands","Portugal"],"keyphrases":["mortality surveillance data","specific mortality data","available data","different countries","mortality surveillance systems","RESULTS Excess mortality","impact of COVID","different European countries","analysis of all-cause mortality data","Clear data","Unreliable data","gender-specific excess mortality","COVID-attributed deaths","METHODS European countries","different methods","indirect deaths","number of deaths","pandemic\u0027s impact","impact of policy choices","different policy responses","Italy","Portugal","health systems","lack of cause","ongoing event disrupting lives","remainder","RSTS","understanding","large disparities","homologue periods","Wales","England","expected value","deviation","France","week","seasonal time series decomposition","varying degrees","Netherlands","day","age","COVID19","economies","total","INTRODUCTION","Comparisons","DISCUSSION","work"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a primary survey of 521 adults on April 1-10, 2020 in Iran, where the official infection rate was 0.08%. In our sample, 3% reported being COVID-19 positive and 15% were unsure of their status. This relatively high positive rate enabled us to conduct the analysis at the 5% significance level. At the time of the survey, 44% of the adults worked from home; 26% still went to work in their workplaces; 27% had stopped working due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3% were unemployed. Adults who exercised more were more likely to be COVID-19 negative. Each additional hour of exercise per day predicted a 78% increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 negative. Adults with chronic medical illnesses were 48% more likely to be COVID-19 negative. In terms of work situation, those who worked from home were the most likely to be COVID-19 negative, and those who had stopped working were the most likely to be COVID-19 positive. Individuals in larger organizations were less likely to be COVID-19 positive. Given the testing shortage in many countries, we identify a novel approach to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection by a set of personal and work situation characteristics, in order to help to identify individuals with more or less risk of contracting the virus. We hope this research opens a new research avenue to identify the individual risk factors of COVID-19 infection to enable more targeted infectious disease prevention, communication, testing, and control to complement the effort to expand testing capacity.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, S.

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lang, Yifei; Li, Wentao; Li, Zeshi; Koerhuis, Danielle; van den Burg, Arthur C.S.; Rozemuller, Erik; Bosch, Berend-Jan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; Boons, Geert-Jan P.H.; Huizinga, Eric G.; van der Schaar, Hilde M.; de Groot, Raoul J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c8847f9dc0c83bcb8f9f91bc75c82c44e1218c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.003699","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S binding affinity","OC43 evolution","spike protein S","BCoV","lectin function","site mutations","receptor-binding","low-affinity S minority variants","Human coronaviruses OC43","convergent evolution","esterase activity","lectin domain","HKU1","affinity majority phenotypes","based receptor usage","fine-tuned activity","hemagglutinin-esterase","site substitutions","forced evolution-population dynamics analysis","envelope protein species","important groups of human","propagation of high","virion-sialoglycan interactions","virus swarms","respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin","O-acetylated sialoglycans","cooperativity","general principles fundamental","clustered substrates","CoVs","animal pathogens","mechanism of glycan","bovine coronavirus","orders of magnitude","balance","worldwide distribution","influenza","spill","adaptation","humans","attachment","release","IAVs","Loss","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

However, striking a balance between a scientifically precise multivariable risk prediction model, and a model which can easily be used by the general public, remains a challenge. A list of risk criteria, as defined by the CDC for example, provides a simple solution, but may be too inclusive by classifying a substantial portion of the population at high risk. Score-based risk classification tools may provide a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity. Objective: To create a score-based risk classification tool for severe COVID-19. Methods: The outcome was defined as a composite of being labeled severe during hospitalization or dying due to COVID-19. The risk classification tool was developed using retrospective data from all COVID-19 patients that were diagnosed until April 1st, 2020 in a large healthcare organization (\u0022training set\u0022). The developed tool combines 10 risk factors using simple summation, and defines three risk levels according to the patient\u0027s age and number of accumulated risk points - basic risk, high risk and very-high risk (the last two levels are also considered together as the elevated risk group). The tool\u0027s performance in accurately identifying individuals at risk was evaluated using a \u0022temporal test set\u0022 of COVID-19 patients diagnosed between April 2nd and April 22nd, 2020, later than those used for model development. The tool\u0027s performance was also compared to that of the CDC\u0027s criteria. The healthcare organization\u0027s general population was used to evaluate the proportion of patients that would be classified to each of the model\u0027s risk levels and as elevated risk by the CDC criteria. Results: A total of 2,421, 2,624 and 4,631,168 individuals were included in the training, test, and general population cohorts, respectively. The outcome rate in the training and test sets was 5%. Overall, 18% of the general population would be classified at elevated risk by the model, with a resulting sensitivity of 92%, compared to 35% that would be defined as elevated risk by the CDC criteria, with a resulting sensitivity of 96%. Within the model\u0027s elevated risk groups, the high and very-high risk groups comprised 15% and 3% of the general population, with an incidence rate (PPV) of 15% and 33%, respectively. Discussion: A simple to communicate score-based risk classification tool classifies at elevated risk about half of the population that is considered to have an elevated risk by the CDC risk criteria, with only a 4% reduction in sensitivity. The model\u0027s ability to further divide the elevated risk population into two markedly different subgroups allows providing more refined recommendations to the general public and limiting the restrictions of social distancing to a smaller and more manageable subset of the population. This model was adopted by the Israeli ministry of health as its risk classification tool for COVID-19 lab tests prioritization and for targeting its instructions on risk management during the lockdown exit strategy.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dagan, N.; Barda, N.; Riesel, D.; Grotto, I.; Sadetzki, S.; Balicer, R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8e952e787c843ca43dff80b41aa2b8dac9cd4f7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20108571v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elevated risk population","personal risk","risk factors","risk management","CDC risk criteria","high risk groups","model\u0027s risk levels","list of risk criteria","model\u0027s elevated risk groups","number of accumulated risk points - basic risk","Score-based risk classification tools","precise multivariable risk prediction model","general population cohorts","severe COVID","CDC criteria","healthcare organization\u0027s general population","general public","developed tool","CDC\u0027s criteria","model development","training set","resulting sensitivity","simple summation","temporal test set","simple solution","test sets","outcome rate","model\u0027s ability","individuals","proportion of patients","tool\u0027s performance","restrictions of social distancing","health authorities","various lockdown","incidence rate","Israeli ministry of health","large healthcare organization","differential targeted advice","patient\u0027s age","good compromise","different subgroups","strategies","refined recommendations","instructions","retrospective data","lab tests prioritization","substantial portion","half","manageable subset","accuracy","simplicity","countries","composite","example","balance","hospitalization","strategy","total","PPV","Discussion","challenge","Results","Background","Methods","reduction","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Prior studies in other respiratory infections suggest that convalescent plasma transfusion may offer benefit to some patients. Here, the outcomes of thirty-nine hospitalized patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion were compared against a cohort of retrospectively matched controls. Methods Plasma recipients were selected based on supplemental oxygen needs at the time of enrollment and the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Recipients were transfused with convalescent plasma from donors with a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) anti-spike antibody titer of [\u2265]1:320 dilution.

Conclusions Convalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, S.

We evaluate the expected impact of reopening schools in lIe-de-France region after the withdrawal of lockdown currently scheduled for May 11, 2020. We explore several scenarios of partial, progressive, or full school reopening, coupled with moderate social distancing interventions and large-scale tracing, testing, and isolation. Accounting for current uncertainty on the role of children in COVID-19 epidemic, we test different hypotheses on children\u0027s transmissibility distinguishing between younger children (pre-school and primary school age) and adolescents (middle and high school age). Reopening schools after lifting lockdown will likely lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the following 2 months, even with lower transmissibility of children, yet protocols exist that would allow maintaining the epidemic under control without saturating the healthcare system. With pre-schools and primary schools in session starting May 11, ICU occupation would reach at most 72% [55,83]% (95% probability ranges) of a 1,500-bed capacity (here foreseen as the routine capacity restored in the region post-first wave) if no other school level reopens before summer or if middle and high schools reopen one month later through a progressive protocol (increasing attendance week by week). Full attendance of adolescents at school starting in June would overwhelm the ICU system (138% [118,159]% occupation). Reopening all schools on May 11 would likely lead to a second wave similar to the one recently experienced, except if maximum attendance is limited to 50% for both younger children and adolescents. Based on the estimated situation on May 11, no substantial difference in the epidemic risk is predicted between progressive and prompt reopening of pre-schools and primary schools, thus allowing full attendance of younger children mostly in need of resuming learning and development. Reopening would require however large-scale trace and testing to promptly isolate cases, in addition to moderate social distancing interventions. Full attendance in middle and high schools is instead not recommended. Findings are consistent across different assumptions on the relative transmissibility of younger children and for small increase of the reproductive number possibly due to decreasing compliance to lockdown.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Domenico, L.; Pullano, G.; Sabbatini, C.

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie \u0026 Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (\u223C4 %) compared to health care professionals (\u223C14 %). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from the severe form of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20--200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (20-60 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this context, we will test the hypothesis that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled therapeutic trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter Time To Response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ \u002B standard-of-care (CPZ \u002B SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ \u002B SOC group, compared to the SOC group: A) superior clinical improvement; B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years, in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its \u0027LARGe ACTion\u0027 properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plaze, Mario; Attali, David; Petit, Anne-C\u00E9cile; Blatzer, Michael; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Vinckier, Fabien; Cachia, Arnaud; Chr\u00E9tien, Fabrice; Gaillard, Rapha\u00EBl","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1a1c64711b3be526f7662305d0c0e3d0aa1f7f8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300798; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300798?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jean Delay","Pierre Deniker"],"organizations":["GHU PARIS Psychiatrie \u0026 Neurosciences","CPZ","SOC","CPZ   SOC","LARGACTIL"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["repositioning of CPZ","Efficacy of CPZ","anti-COVID","CPZ antiviral activity","CPZ repositioning strategy","main advantages of CPZ","contagiousness of COVID","high CPZ concentration","optimal dosage of CPZ","anti-SARS-CoV","ongoing COVID","severe forms of COVID","anti-MERS-CoV","clinical studies","contagiousness of SARS","neurological forms of COVID","severe form of COVID","SOC group","unfavorable evolution of COVID","greater decrease","infection severity","infection contagiousness","clinical routine","psychiatric patients","anti-coronavirus drug development","superior clinical improvement","fatal coronavirus infection","treatment of acute","coronavirus infections","secondary objectives","respiratory tropism of SARS","biological parameters of response","Sainte-Anne hospital","inflammatory markers","biological markers of viral attack","France","main objective","intensive care","independent studies","level of severity","times higher","Abstract OBJECTIVES","plasma","psychiatric units","hypothesis","antipsychotic effects","involvement of inflammatory cytokines","health care professionals","rapid strategy","parenchymal involvement","shorter Time","antiviral drugs","viral load","precious time","effective methods","antipsychotic medication","GHU PARIS Psychiatrie","single blind","Pierre Deniker","chest CT","Neurosciences","lower prevalence of symptomatic","randomized controlled therapeutic trial","experimental steps","inhibition of clathrin","virus propagation","lymphopenia","CRP","PCR","TTR","number of infected people","phenothiazine derivative","day post-randomization","phase","Jean Delay","tolerance","need","lungs","Ordinal Scale","therapy","saliva","oxygen","standard","pilot","mediated endocytosis","chronic psychoses","blood-brain barrier","total","pandemic","biodistribution","reduction","lethality","radiological criteria","Patient recruitment","cases","comparison","addition","context","humans","psychotropic treatments","weeks","Chlorpromazine","CONCLUSION","Urgent action","Similar observations","deaths","beginning","guidelines","CPZ properties","psychiatry","broad spectrum of CPZ treatment","careful clinical observations","innovative therapeutic approaches","antiviral","antipsychotic","anxiolytic","modulation of blood","immunomodulatory effects","field of mental illness","FDA-approved drug","headaches","line","antiemetic","excellent tolerance profile","fight SARS-CoV","brain barrier","result of serendipity","pregnancy","reference","various neurological conditions","advanced cancer","LARGe ACTion","nausea","LARGACTIL","years","molecules"],"language":"en"},

The development of effective resource models are critical for long term health planning. The aim was to evaluate the available literature, to consider parameters affecting hospital resources, to effectively guide health policy and planning. Design: A detailed search of the literature, using Google Scholar, PubMED, MedRxiv and BioRxiv, was conducted for the time period 01-DEC-2019 to 04-MAY-2020; using appropriate keywords: resultant articles were scrutinised in detail, and appraised for reported data pertaining to hospitalization and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: Disease presentation was described in China; 81 % mild, 14 % moderate and 5 % severe. The experience, thus far, in Europe and the USA are suggestive of a higher degree of severity. Initial reports suggest high hospitalisation and ICU admittance rates. More recent reports from the ECDC lower this estimation. Perhaps the relative age, the level of pre-existing conditions, and other health factors may be contributors to differences. Data from Irish cases suggest hospitalisation rate may be lower in parts of Europe and time dependent. Hospital LOS is described in seventeen articles, with median lengths of stay between 4 and 25 days. The evidence regarding the LOS in ICU is reported in eighteen studies, fifteen deemed relevant. The majority of studies report ICU LOS between 7 to 10 days. Many of these studies are likely skewed towards shorter stay due to study cut-off dates. Indications based on ICU LOS reported for patients continuing care suggest median ICU stay will be longer. Conclusions: These parameter estimates are key to the development of an effective health care resource model. Based on our rapid appraisal of the literature, is it essential that Europe manages mitigation measures to ensure that hospital and ICU capacity does not become overwhelmed to manage this pandemic long term.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lane, E.

The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV), now declared a pandemic has an overall case fatality of 2 to 3% but it is as high as 50% in critically ill patients. D-dimer is an important prognostic tool, often elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and in those who suffered death. In this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer in COVID-19 infected patients. Methods. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane for studies reporting admission D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients and its effect on mortality. Results. 18 studies (16 retrospective and 2 prospective) with a total of 3,682 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled mean difference (MD) suggested significantly elevated D-dimer levels in patients who died versus those survived (MD 6.13 mg/L, 95% CI 4.16 to 8.11, p \u003C0.001). Similarly, the pooled mean D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (MD 0.54 mg/L, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.8, p\u003C 0.001). In addition, the risk of mortality was four-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer vs negative D-dimer (RR 4.11, 95% CI 2.48 to 6.84, p\u003C 0.001) and the risk of developing the severe disease was two-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer levels vs negative D-dimer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.11, p \u003C 0.001). Conclusion.

Design: Individual-based transmission modelling using Swedish demographic and Geographical Information System data and conservative COVID-19 epidemiological parameters. Setting: Sweden Participants: A model to simulate all 10.09 million Swedish residents. Interventions: 5 different non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions including the mitigation strategy of the Swedish government as of 10 April; isolation of the entire household of confirmed cases; closure of schools and non-essential businesses with or without strict social distancing; and strict social distancing with closure of schools and non-essential businesses. Main outcome measures: Estimated acute care and intensive care hospitalisations, COVID-19 attributable deaths, and infections among healthcare workers from 10 April until 29 June. Findings: Our model for Sweden shows that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, the current Swedish public-health strategy will result in a peak intensive-care load in May that exceeds pre-pandemic capacity by over 40-fold, with a median mortality of 96,000 (95% CI 52,000 to 183,000). The most stringent public-health measures examined are predicted to reduce mortality by approximately three-fold. Intensive-care load at the peak could be reduced by over two-fold with a shorter period at peak pandemic capacity. Conclusions: Our results predict that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, current measures in Sweden will result in at least 40-fold over-subscription of pre-pandemic Swedish intensive care capacity, with 15.8 percent of Swedish healthcare workers unable to work at the pandemic peak. Modifications to ICU admission criteria from international norms would further increase mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gardner, Jasmine M; Willem, Lander; van der Wijngaart, Wouter; Kamerlin, Shina Caroline Lynn; Brusselaers, Nele; Kasson, Peter","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dfb40db0f72bab90ccd54a62c0d7ce46f4610bf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Geographical Information System","ICU"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["pandemic peak","peak intensive-care load","peak pandemic capacity","fold","Swedish demographic","Swedish government","Swedish residents","over-subscription of pre-pandemic Swedish intensive care capacity","intensive care hospitalisations","pre-pandemic capacity","current Swedish public-health strategy","acute care","conservative COVID","non-pharmaceutical interventions","non-essential businesses","different non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions","percent of Swedish healthcare workers unable","conservative epidemiological parameter estimates","current measures","stringent public-health measures","healthcare system","overall mortality","median mortality","closure of schools","strict social distancing","epidemiological parameters","Sweden Participants","Main outcome measures","mitigation strategy","Geographical Information System data","Individual-based transmission modelling","attributable deaths","international norms","entire household of confirmed cases","ICU admission criteria","shorter period","Modifications","isolation","Design","infections","Setting","results","Findings","Conclusions","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Design: Prospective national population-based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). Setting: All 194 obstetric units in the UK Participants: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection between 01/03/2020 and 14/04/2020. 694 comparison women who gave birth between 01/11/2017 and 31/10/2018.

Methods: Adult suspected patients aged \u003E18 years within 14 days who underwent chest CT scan and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to results of RT-PCR tests. The data of basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for confirmed and non-confirmed groups. Results: A total of 130 patients were enrolled with 54 cases positive and 76 cases negative. The typical CT imaging features of positive group were ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally, close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features combined, GGO with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGO with pleural distribution were more common, of which were 31 cases (57.4%) and 30 cases (55.6%) respectively.

We propose a method for predicting both ICU requirements and the number of deaths, and which will enable the health authorities of the countries involved to plan the resources needed to face the pandemic as many days in advance as possible. Methods We use official Spanish data to predict ICU admissions and deaths based on the number of infections. We employ OLS to perform the econometric estimation, and through RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE forecast performance measures we select the best lagged predictor of both dependent variables. Findings For Spain, our prediction shows that the best predictor of ICU admissions is the number of people infected eight days before, and that the best predictor of deaths is the number of people infected five days before. In the first case, we obtain a 98% coefficient of determination, and in the second a 97% coefficient. The estimated delayed elasticities find that a 1% increase in the number of cases today will imply a 0.72% increase in ICU patients eight days later and a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths five days later. Interpretation The model is not intended to analyse the epidemiology of COVID-19. Our objective is rather to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs. Having a forecast model available several days in advance can enable governments to more effectively face the gap between needs and resources triggered by the outbreak and thus reduce the deaths caused by COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hierro-Recio, Luis Angel; Garzon-Gordon, Antonio Jose; Atienza-Montero, Pedro; Marquez, Jose Luis","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08826d0596a01a2a482eb6d80edb0e87cddc304e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051821","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of deaths","days","number of people","number of cases","number of infections","best predictor of deaths","best predictor of ICU admissions","high reproductive number","increase","ICU requirements","ICU patients","best lagged predictor","associated clinical needs","advance","resources","pandemic","epidemiology of COVID","leading indicator of clinical needs","forecast model available","health authorities","coefficient of determination","SMAPE forecast performance measures","overwhelming national health systems","official Spanish data","RMSE","prediction","dependent variables","econometric estimation","Methods","countries","gap","governments","outbreak","estimated delayed elasticities","Findings","Spain","OLS","evolution","objective","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00B1 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00B1 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 \u00B1 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"ZHOU, Guopeng; CHI, Chunhua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57e01ad2a4961cd5cc6a3733f5f8c013a8946f3c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["total patients number","simulation model","simulated patients","Cumulation number of patients","Total infected patients","future unknown infectious disease","end of period","virus epidemic","Wuhan","different level of control measures","novel severe respiratory disease","Current strict control measures","healthcare personals","medical supplies","medical hardware","new unknown virus pneumonia cases","shoulder of healthcare workers","different patient0 status","current work tent","setup","public health emergency of international concern","day70","consequences of various efforts","purpose","people","fast reacting system","local hospitals","times","mean incubation time","early detecting","great burden","free transmission state","COVID","days","Personal activity index","China","beginning","provinces","known parameters","day90","R0","supplements","day50","Method","Conclusion","Background","periods"],"language":"en"},

However, the death rate across affected countries shows variation deserving of critical evaluation. Methods: In this study, we evaluated differentials in COVID-19 confirmed cases of infection and associated deaths of selected countries in Sub-Sahara Africa (Nigeria and Ghana), South Africa, Europe (Italy, Spain, Sweden and UK) and USA. Data acquired for various standard databases on mutational shift of the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on geographical location, BCG vaccination policy, malaria endemicity, climatic conditions (temperature), differential healthcare approaches were evaluated over a period of 45 days from the date of reporting the index case. Results: The number of confirmed cases of infection and associated deaths in Sub-Sahara Africa were found to be very low compared to the very high values in Europe and USA over the same period. Recovery rate from COVID-19 is not correlated with the mutational attributes of the virus with the sequenced strain from Nigeria having no significant difference (p\u003E0.05) from other geographical regions. Significantly higher (p\u003C0.05) infection rate and mortality from COVID-19 were observed in countries (Europe and USA) without a current universal BCG vaccination policy compared to those with one (Sub-Sahara African countries). Countries with high malaria burden had significantly lower (p\u003C0.05) cases of COVID-19 than those with low malaria burden. A strong negative correlation (-0.595) between mean annual temperature and COVID-19 infection and death was observed with 14.8% variances between temperature and COVID-19 occurrence among the countries. A clear distinction was observed in the COVID-19 disease management between the developed countries (Europe and USA) and Sub-Sahara Africa. Conclusions: The study established that the wide variation in the outcome of the COVID-19 disease burden in the selected countries are attributable largely to climatic condition (temperature) and differential healthcare approaches to management of the disease. We recommend consideration and mainstreaming of these findings for urgent intervention and management of COVID-19 across these continents.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otitoloju, Adebayo A; Okafor, Ifeoma P; Fasona, Mayowa; Bawa-Allah, Kafilat Adebola; Isanbor, Chukwuemeka; Onyeka, Chukwudozie Solomon; Folarin, Olawale S; Adubi, Taiwo O; Sogbanmu, Temitope O; Ogbeibu, Anthony E","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6783cdb8fe050c1e67afc535f5d1d073781f9b7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072322v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","USA","BCG"],"locations":["Africa","Ghana","South Africa","Sweden","Europe","Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","management of COVID","affected countries","developed countries","Sub-Sahara African countries","Europe","infection rate","associated deaths of selected countries","disease management","disease burden","thousands of confirmed cases of infection","number of confirmed cases of infection","death rate","high malaria burden","low malaria burden","South Africa","Nigeria","malaria endemicity","differential healthcare approaches","mean annual temperature","SARS-CoV","study","period","Recovery rate","current universal BCG vaccination policy","climatic conditions","mutational shift","geographical location","wide variation","high values","mutational attributes","geographical regions","Ghana","Italy","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","various standard databases","sequenced strain","Sweden","Spain","significant difference","date","findings","UK","urgent intervention","outcome","differentials","global pandemic","critical evaluation","Results","variances","mortality","occurrence","strong negative correlation","index case","days","clear distinction","consideration","Conclusions","Methods","continents","Background"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar were examined with the searches restricted to the years 2019 and 2020. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review\u0027s eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. Conclusion: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence generated was graded as low.

Through a systematic review, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study, we found that the low blood sodium population may significantly increase the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We extracted the data of serum sodium concentrations of patients with COVID-19 on admission from the articles published between Jan 1 and April 28, 2020, and analyzed the relationship between the serum sodium concentrations and the illness severity of patients. Then we used a cohort of 244 patients with COVID-19 for a retrospective analysis. Results We identified 36 studies, one of which comprised 2736 patients.The mean serum sodium concentration in patients with COVID-19 was 138.6 mmol/L, which was much lower than the median level in population (142.0). The mean serum sodium concentration in severe/critical patients (137.0) was significantly lower than those in mild and moderate patients (140.8 and 138.7, respectively). Such findings were confirmed in a retrospective cohort study, of which the mean serum sodium concentration in all patients was 137.5 mmol/L, and the significant differences were found between the mild (139.2) and moderate (137.2) patients, and the mild and severe/critical (136.6) patients. Interestingly, such changes were not obvious in the serum chlorine and potassium concentrations. Conclusions The low sodium state of patients with COVID-19 may not be the consequence of virus infection, but could be a physiological state possibly caused by living habits such as low salt diet and during aging process, which may result in ACE2 overexpression, and increase the risk and severity of COVID-19. These findings may provide a new idea for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Y.; Li, Y.; Dai, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30af6422cd27526527c45fcedc0418a6f8388d74.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.20102509v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["critical patients","moderate patients","low sodium state of patients","data of serum sodium concentrations of patients","mean serum sodium concentration","illness severity of patients","body sodium","severity of COVID","serum chlorine","low blood sodium population","treatment of COVID","retrospective cohort study","retrospective analysis","severity of SARS","SARS-CoV","potassium concentrations","risk","expression of ACE2","ACE2 overexpression","findings","mmol","low salt diet","meta-analysis","physiological state","consequence of virus infection","angiotensin","human lung tissue cells","habits","aging process","systematic review","important factor","new idea","enzyme","Background Novel coronavirus","prevention","Conclusions","median level","admission","relationship","significant differences","changes","Methods","articles","studies"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to provide a CT-based pattern categorization to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods 165 patients with COVID-19 (91 men, 4-89 years) underwent chest CT were retrospectively enrolled. CT findings were categorized as Pattern0 (negative), Pattern1 (bronchopneumonia), Pattern2 (organizing pneumonia), Pattern3 (progressive organizing pneumonia) and Pattern4 (diffuse alveolar damage). Clinical findings were compared across different categories. Time-dependent progression of CT patterns and correlations with clinical outcomes, i.e. discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU, requiring mechanical ventilation, or death), with pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed. Results Of 94 patients with outcome, 81(86.2%) were discharged, 3(3.2%) were admitted to ICU, 4(4.3%) required mechanical ventilation, 6(6.4%) died. 31(38.3%) had complete absorption at median day 37 after symptom-onset. Significant differences between pattern-categories were found in age, disease-severity, comorbidity and laboratory results (all P\u003C0.05). Remarkable evolution was observed in Pattern0-2 and Pattern3-4 within 3 and 2 weeks after symptom-onset, respectively; most of patterns remained thereafter. After controlling for age, CT pattern significantly correlated with adverse outcomes (Pattern4 vs. Pattern0-3 [reference]; hazard-ratio[95%CI], 18.90[1.91-186.60], P=0.012).

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology \u2014 WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology \u2014 one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daughton, Christian G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/767692d34f9ff83fb878d94c7ece81d814834db4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972033151X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972033151X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WBE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitigating Covid","trends of Covid","magnitude of Covid","presence of Covid","important tool","key tool","epidemiological tool","public health officials","daunting challenges","overwhelming challenges","standardized WBE methodology","immense challenges","WBE measures chemical signatures","accessible health care","global domino effects","stability of economies","large-scale application of diagnostic testing","type of clinical diagnostic testing","Coronavirus disease","infected individuals","entire community","mainstay approach","countless unanticipated problems","collective signature of entire communities","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","safety","interconnected society","food security","fragment biomarkers","levels","world\u0027s complex","therapeutic treatments","sewage","stay-at-home policies","intercomparable data","years","financial institutions","fast surveys of large populations","urgent need","nationalized monitoring networks","Wastewater-Based Epidemiology","individual case level","pre-exposure prophylaxis","epidemics","stress humans","SARS-CoV","distribution","infections","development","potential","outbreaks","environmental scientists","population-wide scales","nations","epidemiologists","pandemic","governments","capital resources","viability of democracies","prudence","overview","initiation"],"language":"en"},

This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 \u0026ldquo:generations\u201D was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical symptoms, 5 asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days. Just 9 of 16 severe patients required ICU care.

Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office. As an application example, we apply our theory to the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The results of the models reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days reduces the infection rate of the healthcare workforce. In case of immunity to the infectious agent this affect is mainly relevant at early stages of the pandemic. This effect is independent on infection rates and increases the overall workforce productivity under certain situations.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanchez-Taltavull, Daniel; Candinas, Daniel; Roldan, Edgar; Beldi, Guido","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd71d794b72ed6273e6fde52fc28faeea50b068f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041863","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Protection of healthcare workforce","overall workforce productivity","Healthcare workers","employment of hospital workforce","care of infected","infected co-workers","studies model workforce productivity","non-infected patients","infection rates","desynchronization strategy","case of coronavirus disease","desynchronization of medical teams","pandemic","COVID","deterministic models","medical teams work","case of immunity","ideal organisational strategy","contact","affect","paramount relevance","infectious agent","presence of reinfection","theory","days","goal","setting","increased risk","modelled strategies","stochastic influences","early stages","account","certain situations","community","efficiency of home office","social distancing","effect","small populations","application example","study","workplace","results"],"language":"en"},

The course of pandemic evolution has shown great differences among countries and not much is yet known about the level of generated immunity, which might appear not to be long-lasting. In this situation, management of a recurrent disease seems to be a plausible scenario that countries worldwide will have to face, before effective drugs or a vaccine appear. Spain in Europe, appears to be the first country deciding to partly lift the strict social distancing regulations imposed. Whether this action may lead to further epidemic recrudescence, to a following second wave of cases or conversely, help return to previous normality, is a subject of great debate and interest to all other countries affected by COVID-19. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we had also incorporated effects of social confinement. We now modify this previous model configuration to mimic potential post-confinement scenarios, by simulating from instant massive liberation of different portions of the confined population, up to a more gradual incorporation of people to work. Results show how current lockdown conditions should be extended at least two weeks more to prevent a new escalation in cases and deaths, as well as a larger second wave occurring in just a few months. Conversely, best-case scenario in terms of lower COVID-19 incidence and casualties should gradually incorporate workers back in a daily proportion at most 30 percent higher than that of previous confinement. The former should begin not earlier than by the end of April and it would represent approximately 600 thousand people or a 3.75% rate for the whole of Spain.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopez, Leonardo; Rodo, Xavier","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd28f4bacbc444d3945c7d08db8e94b41f14e33b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064766","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["China","Spain","Europe"],"keyphrases":["previous confinement","countries","wave of cases","previous model configuration","previous normality","infected cases","effects of social confinement","Spain","potential post-confinement scenarios","spread of infection","spread of SARS","great differences","epidemic recrudescence","best-case scenario","plausible scenario","terms of lower COVID","subject of great debate","gradual incorporation of people","strict social distancing regulations","modified SEIR compartmental model accounting","instant massive liberation of different portions","incidence","percent higher","recurrent disease","workers","daily proportion","confined population","casualties","deaths","new escalation","course of pandemic evolution","help","current lockdown conditions","Results","situation","management","weeks","world","China","latent period","death toll","level of generated immunity","effective drugs","vaccine","action","country","Europe","months","end"],"language":"en"},

This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape this transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We hypothesize that the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA in replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hartenian, Ella N; Glaunsinger, Britt A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce16fdcdc9f5932ac2e66646317a33f142ee1eb6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/585984","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pol II"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay","MHV68-induced mRNA decay","viral genome","mRNA endonuclease","widespread RNA decay","Viral genes","localization of viral DNA","viral promoter sequences","viral transcript loss","widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation","genome-wide reduction of Pol","mammalian cells","mammalian promoters","impaired RNA polymerase","gammaherpesviruses","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","KSHV","replication compartments","occupancy","infection","location","murine gammaherpesvirus","means","fact","Protection","ability"],"language":"en"},

Given the seriousness of the situation, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic as the Covid-19 rapidly around the world. Among its applications, chest X-ray images are frequently used for an early diagnostic/screening of Covid-19 disease, given the frequent pulmonary impact in the patients, critical issue to prevent further complications caused by this highly infectious disease. In this work, we propose complementary fully automatic approaches for the classification of chest X-ray images under the analysis of 3 different categories: Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. Given the similarity between the pathological impact in the lungs between Covid-19 and pneumonia, mainly during the initial stages of both lung diseases, we performed an exhaustive study of differentiation considering different pathological scenarios. To face these classification tasks, we exploited and adapted to this topic a densely convolutional network architecture, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. To validate the designed approaches, several representative experiments were performed using images retrieved from different public chest X-ray images datasets. Overall, satisfactory results were obtained from the designed experiments, facilitating the doctors\u0027 work and allowing better an early diagnostic/screening and treatment of this relevant pandemic pathology.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Moura, J.; Novo, J.; Ortega, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54a328a21ff2a09b33c0d6f802ac955731e6a690.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20087254v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["screening of Covid","classification of chest X-ray images","different public chest X-ray images datasets","pathological impact","different categories","different pathological scenarios","new infectious disease","pneumonia","designed experiments","designed approaches","early diagnostic","layer","global pandemic","automatic approaches","representative experiments","doctors\u0027 work","classification tasks","frequent pulmonary impact","World Health Organization","relevant pandemic pathology","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","treatment","analysis","exhaustive study of differentiation","patients","lung diseases","critical issue","SARS-CoV","situation","initial stages","complications","lungs","convolutional network architecture","topic","feed-forward fashion","applications","satisfactory results","healthy cases","seriousness","similarity"],"language":"en"},

Leaving the economy locked down for a long time is its own catastrophe. An SIR-type model with clear parameters suitable for public information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities which learns disease spread characteristics rapidly as policy changes, suggests that a solution to the problem is a partial unlock. Case load can be managed so as not to exceed critical resources such as ventilators, yet allow enough people to get sick that herd immunity develops and a full unlock can be achieved in as little as five weeks from beginning of implementation. The partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week. Given that not all areas or individuals will respond, and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely, the partial unlock might be 5 full working days per week.

We aimed to develop and validate a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both qualified laboratories and point-of-care settings. Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 and close contacts between Jan 26 and April 8, 2020, were recruited from two hospitals. Respiratory samples were collected and tested with LAMP and the results were compared with those obtained by RT-qPCR. The inconsistent samples between these two methods were subjected to next-generation sequencing for confirmation. In addition, we tested the RT-LAMP on an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and patients with other respiratory viral infections. Results We finally collected a cohort of 129 cases (329 nasopharyngeal swabs) and the independent cohort of 76 patients (152 nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples). RT-LAMP was validated to be accurate (overall sensitivity and specificity: 88.89% and 99.00%; positive and negative predictive values: 94.74% and 97.78%) and diagnostically useful (positive and negative likelihood ratios: 88.89 and 0.11). RT-LAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92) compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature heating and visual inspection. The median time required for RT-LAMP was less than 1 h from sample to result. Further analyses indicated that RT-LAMP was feasible for asymptomatic patients and did not cross-react with other respiratory pathogen infections. Conclusion The RT-LAMP assay offers a rapid, sensitive and straightforward detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing in the public domain and hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, X.; Deng, Q.; Li, J.; Chen, J.; Wang, Z.; Fang, Z.; Li, H.; Zhao, Y.; Yu, P.; Li, W.; Wang, X.; Li, S.; Zhang, L.; Hou, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63a17740a40da7b04903d973531a06f43ae458bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20108530v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP assay","RT-qPCR","SARS-CoV","asymptomatic patients","Methods Patients","asymptomatic COVID","Respiratory samples","suspected COVID","expansion of COVID","convenient COVID","outbreak of SARS","timely treatment of patients","nasopharyngeal swabs","respiratory viral infections","sputum samples","respiratory pathogen infections","inconsistent samples","hospitals","results","independent cohort","increased sensitivity","overall sensitivity","negative likelihood ratios","negative predictive values","isothermal amplification","constant temperature heating","novel reverse transcription loop","testing","diagnostics","screening","straightforward detection","carrier","point","visual inspection","vs","containment","qualified laboratories","public domain","high consistency","specificity","close contacts","kappa","cases","median time","Conclusion","care settings","generation sequencing","confirmation","analyses","addition"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A model using the Polynomial Regression with cubic adjustments of the number of days of contagion, demographic density, city population and climatic factors was designed to explain the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. Main results: It was evidenced that temperature variation maintains a relationship with the reduction in the number of cases of COVID-19, but on a very small scale.

Cities with higher temperatures do not necessarily it is more protected from the SARS-CoV-2 than those with lower temperatures, however, strong statistical significance was found, this relationship deserves to be investigated in other tests with longer time series, wide and with especially non-linear data adjustments.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodrigues, W.; Prata, D.

A third virus, the H5N1, responsible for avian influenza, has caused infection with some clinical similarities to those in COVID-19 infections. Cytokines, small proteins that modulate immune responses, have been directly implicated in some of the severe responses seen in COVID-19 patients, e.g. cytokine storms. Understanding the immune processes related to COVID-19, and other similar infections, could help identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Here we examine data of cytokine, immune cell types, and disease associations captured from biomedical literature associated with coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1 influenza, with the objective of identifying potentially useful relationships and areas for future research. Cytokine and cell-type associations captured from MeSH terms linked to thousands of PubMed abstracts, has identified differing patterns of associations between the three corpuses of abstracts (coronavirus, SARS, or H5N1 influenza). Clustering of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in the context of coronavirus has identified compelling clusters of co-morbidities and symptoms, some of which already known to be linked to COVID-19. Finally, network analysis identified sub-networks of cytokines and immune cell types associated with different manifestations, co-morbidities and symptoms of coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1. Systematic review of research in medicine is essential to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions. In a fast moving pandemic the approach taken here will identify trends and enable rapid comparison to the literature of related diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geifman, Nophar; Whetton, Anthony D","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8e10384324287965c467cf6acbc15f3baabfb04.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20065425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H5N1 influenza","SARS-CoV virus","immune cell types","symptoms of coronavirus","immune responses","context of coronavirus","disease associations","immune processes","data of cytokine","Clustering of cytokine","cytokine storms","cell-type associations","cause of recent COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV","avian influenza","severe responses","differing patterns of associations","literature of related diseases","compelling clusters of co-morbidities","disease co-occurrences","corpuses of abstracts","biomedical literature","future research","similar infections","sub-networks of cytokines","thousands of PubMed abstracts","Systematic review of research","high rates of infection","fast moving pandemic","different manifestations","MeSH terms","evidence-based choices","useful relationships","medicine","diagnostic markers","rapid comparison","close relative","health interventions","approach","areas","network analysis","objective","small proteins","patients","globe","therapeutic targets","trends","mortality","clinical similarities","individuals","date"],"language":"en"},

Results: Single fabric layers blocked a range of ultrafine particles. When fabrics were layered, significantly more ultrafine particles were filtered. Several fabric combinations were successful in removing similar amounts of ultrafine particles when compared to an N95 mask and surgical mask.

A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. Purpose: This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Results: Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Conclusions: Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dorn, M.; Avila, E.; Alho, C.

Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro. The main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2 is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Estrada, Ernesto","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42cb73be235728c3b4a52b7e639144fc8de40a88.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.023887","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["main protease of SARS CoV","average SARS CoV","potent inhibitors of SARS CoV","new coronavirus SARS CoV","topological property of SARS CoV","design of new potent anti-SARS CoV","new protease of transmitting perturbations","structural perturbations","effects of powerful protease inhibitors","capacity of transmitting perturbations","largest sensitivity of Mpro","strongest inhibitors","binding site of strong inhibitors","catalytic site Cys","crystal structure of free Mpro","amino acids","increased sensitivity","long-range interactions","fact","findings","large structural resemblance","tiny structural changes","antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID","attractive pharmacological target","essential viral functions","involvement","domains","urgent necessity of effective medication","important targets","proteases","simplified representation","residue network","proteolytic processing of polyproteins","account","pandemic","world","enzyme","analogue","sensititivy"],"language":"en"},

This is achieved via a SEIR model. Using an expected latent period of 4.5 days and infectious period of 3.8 days, R_0 was first estimated as 3.18 using observed death rates under unmitigated spread and then under the effects of the total lock down (R_0=0.60) of 23 March. The case fatality rate given infection is taken as 1%. Parameter values for mean length of stay and conditional probability of death for ICU and non-ICU hospital admissions are guided by Ferguson et al.(2020). Under unmitigated spread the model predicts around 600,000 deaths in the UK. Starting with one exposed person at time zero and a suppression consistent with an R_0 of 0.60 on day 72, the model predicts around 39,000 deaths for a first wave, but this reduces to around 11,000 if the intervention takes place one week earlier. If the initial suppression were in place until day 200 and then relaxed to an R_0 of 1.5 between days 200 and 300, to be followed by a return to an R_0 of 0.60, the model predicts around 43,000 deaths. This would increase to around 48,000 if the release from the first suppression takes place one week earlier. The results indicate the extreme sensitivity to timing and the consequences of even small delays to suppression and premature relaxation of such measures.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dagpunar, J.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is responsible for mediating viral attachment and fusion with cell membranes. Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and specific sites of S-protein have undergone positive selection impacting the viral pathogenicity. In the present work, we used high-throughput computation to design 100,000 mutants in RBD interfacial residues and identify novel affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations at the interfacial residues in RBD. Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests that a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection. Knowledge of the affinity-enhancing mutations may guide the identification of potential cold-spots for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of hot-spots, and vice versa. Understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and host protein presents a detailed systems view of viral infection mechanisms. The applications of the present research can be explored in multiple antiviral strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccine design, and importantly in understanding the clinical pathogenesis of the virus itself.

However, in a wide range of experimental settings in particular for studies in infectious or brain-related diseases, human samples cannot be easily obtained. Hence, due to their close developmental, immunological and neurological proximity with humans, non-human primates are used in many research fields of human diseases and for preclinical research. Few studies have used DNA methylation microarrays in simian models. Microarrays designed for the analysis of DNA methylation patterns in the human genome could be useful given the genomic proximity between human and nonhuman primates. However, there is currently information lacking about the specificity and usability of each probe for many nonhuman primate species, including rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), originating from Asia, and African green monkeys originating from West-Africa (Chlorocebus sabaeus). Rhesus macaques and African green monkeys are among the major nonhuman primate models utilized in biomedical research. Here, we provide a precise evaluation and re-annotation of the probes of the two microarrays for the analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these two Cercopithecidae species. We demonstrate that up to 162,000 of the 450K and 255,000 probes of the EPIC BeadChip can be reliably used in Macaca mulatta or Chlorocebus sabaeus. The annotation files are provided in a format compatible with a variety of preprocessing, normalization and analytical pipelines designed for data analysis from 450K/EPIC arrays, facilitating high-throughput DNA methylation analyses in Macaca mulatta and Chlorocebus sabaeus. They provide the opportunity to the research community to focus their analysis only on those probes identified as reliable. The described analytical workflow leaves the choice to the user to balance coverage versus specificity and can also be applied to other Cercopithecidae species.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pichon, Fabien; Busato, Florence; Jochems, Simon; Jacquelin, Beatrice; Le Grand, Roger; Deleuze, Jean-Francois; M\u00FCller-Trutwin, Michaela; Tost, J\u00F6rg","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/573b0a020ae0d40cbbf108e4733152c1164e89bf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.081547","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Microarrays"],"organizations":["Infinium Human","CpG"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["human genome","DNA methylation microarrays","analysis of DNA methylation patterns","human samples","wide DNA methylation patterns","analysis of genome","research fields of human diseases","Methylation EPIC BeadChips","non-human primates","Infinium Human Methylation450","Macaca mulatta","Chlorocebus sabaeus","probes","methylation state of hundreds","nonhuman primate species","high-throughput DNA methylation analyses","nonhuman primates","data analysis","biomedical research","preclinical research","research community","Cercopithecidae species","major nonhuman primate models","African green monkeys","rhesus macaques","EPIC arrays","studies","specificity","neurological proximity","genomic proximity","useful tools","analytical pipelines","simian models","re-annotation","annotation files","brain-related diseases","described analytical workflow","wide range of experimental settings","study","humans","thousands of CpG","variety of preprocessing","West-Africa","choice","normalization","Asia","format compatible","user","usability","precise evaluation","affordable cost","coverage","information","opportunity"],"language":"en"},

It is still unclear how comorbidities affect the risk of infection and severity of COVID-19. Methods: A nationwide retrospective case-control study of 65,149 individuals, aged 18 years or older, whose medical cost for COVID-19 testing were claimed until April 8, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 and severity of COVID-19 infection were identified from the reimbursement data using diagnosis codes and based on whether respiratory support was used, respectively. Odds ratios were estimated using multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, region, healthcare utilization, and insurance status. Results: The COVID-19 group (5,172 of 65,149) was younger and showed higher proportion of females. 5.6% (293 of 5,172) of COVID-19 cases were severe. The severe COVID-19 group had older patients and a higher male ratio than the non-severe group. Cushing syndrome (Odds ratio range (ORR) 2.059-2.358), chronic renal disease (ORR 1.292-1.604), anemia (OR 1.132), bone marrow dysfunction (ORR 1.471-1.645), and schizophrenia (ORR 1.287-1.556) showed significant association with infection of COVID-19. In terms of severity, diabetes (OR 1.417, 95% CI 1.047-1.917), hypertension (OR 1.378, 95% CI 1.008-1.883), heart failure (ORR 1.562-1.730), chronic lower respiratory disease (ORR 1.361-1.413), non-infectious lower digestive system disease (ORR 1.361-1.418), rheumatoid arthritis (ORR 1.865-1.908), substance use (ORR 2.790-2.848), and schizophrenia (ORR 3.434-3.833) were related with severe COVID-19.

Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13/40 (32.5%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10-5). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10-8, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of \u2265 80 pg/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial.

Here, analysis of all proteins of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a unique PPxY Late (L) domain motif 25PPAY28 in spike protein inside hot disordered loop predicted subject to phosphorylation and binding. It was demonstrated in enveloped RNA viruses that PPxY motif recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases and ultimately the ESCRT complex to enhance virus budding and release that means a high viral load, hence facilitating new infections. Note that PPxY motif is not present in proteins of SARS-CoV. This suggests that PPxY motif by its role in enhancing the viral load could explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV. Of course, after the experimental verifications showing that PPxY motif plays the same role as reported for other enveloped RNA viruses, it could become an interesting target for the development of novel host-oriented antivirals therapeutics for preventing S protein to recruit Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases partners.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maaroufi, Halim","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/228501f1ca56ca0d7d432658591baf02decdf270.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.052217","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","unique PPxY","proteins of SARS","PPxY motif recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases","domain motif 25PPAY28","enveloped RNA viruses","role","Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases partners","high viral load","spike protein","S protein","development of novel host-oriented antivirals therapeutics","hot disordered loop","subject","phosphorylation","release","ESCRT complex","Coronavirus Disease","interesting target","new infections","people","socioeconomic life","health","pandemic","global COVID","binding","experimental verifications","vaccines","molecular mechanisms","humans","analysis","world"],"language":"en"},

The most urgent thing is to find effective treatments. Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine application may be associated with a decreased risk of death in critically ill COVID-19 patients and what is potential mechanism. Design, Setting and Patients: This retrospective study included all 568 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by pathogen laboratory tests despite antiviral treatment and had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, PAO2/FIO2 \u003C300 with need of mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, between February 1 of 2020 to April 8 of 2020. All 568 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them additionally received oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days). Primary endpoint is mortality of patients, and inflammatory cytokines levels were compared between hydroxychloroquine and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital death and hospital stay time (day) were obtained, level of inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) was measured and compared between HCQ and NHCQ treatments. RESULTS: The median age of 568 critically ill patients is 68 (57, 76) years old with 37.0% being female. Mortalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group and 45.8% (238/520) in NHCQ group (p\u003C0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4 - 14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (p\u003C0.05). The level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly lowered from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg/mL at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg/ml (p\u003C0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with a decreased mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine should be prescribed for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients to save lives.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, B.; Wang, D.

Special attention is paid to developed countries, where existing surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure have provided detailed insights into the nature changing patterns in rabies epidemiology-patterns expected to be increasingly relevant to other less-developed nations based on current trends. Special attention is afforded to canine rabies, as dogs remain responsible for over 99% of all human exposures to the virus, including the methods and problems associated with intentional and unintentional movement of dogs at national and international levels.

Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections.

The current study proposes the estimate of the COVID-19 extent for countries with sufficiently high number of deaths and cases. The estimate is based on a simple model of mortality. This model was developed for a reference country with a large number of cases and high intensity of COVID-19 testing. The model is then applied to compute apparent mortality in the target and reference countries. The number of cases in the target country is then estimated assuming constant underlying true mortality. The estimate of cases in most countries is significantly higher than the official record. As of April 12, 2020, the global estimate is 5.2 million compared to 1.8 million in the official record. The models developed in this study are available at covid-model.net. The model ignores several factors that are known to influence mortality, such as the demographics and health condition of population, state of epidemic and sociological differences between countries.

The majority of viruses are apparent progeny of strains derived from Europe and Asia. We found no significant evidence of more virulent viral types, stressing the linkage between severe disease, underlying medical conditions, and perhaps host genetics.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms, or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries. We estimate that clinical symptoms occur in 25% (95% CrI: 19-32%) of infections in 10-19-year-olds, rising to 76% (68-82%) in over-70s, and that susceptibility to infection in under-20s is approximately half that of older adults. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children may have a relatively small impact on total cases, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility we have estimated has implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19 because of demographic differences across settings: in younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, Nicholas G; Klepac, Petra; Liu, Yang; Prem, Kiesha; Jit, Mark; Eggo, Rosalind M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be06a4f1d96c62391496a8f06a3d00cdf0ae0f9c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical cases","clinical symptoms","lower susceptibility","children","age-specific clinical fraction","total cases","observed cases","low proportion of cases","expected clinical attack rate","older populations","lower propensity","Age disparities","pandemic","younger populations","age-structured mathematical model","low-income countries","expected global burden of COVID","older adults","transmissibility of subclinical infections","epidemic data","demographic differences","regions","effective control measures","comorbidities","settings","half","implications","small impact","disease severity","later stages","possibilities","year-olds","interventions","CrI"],"language":"en"},

This clinical figure is significantly different from that of anosmia after upper respiratory infection, which occurs in only a small proportion of patients and does not recover or requires months to recover. The background mechanisms of COVID-19 induced olfactory dysfunction have not been elucidated. Methods To address the unique pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19, we examined the existence and distribution of ACE2 (virus binding receptor), TMPRSS2 and Furin (proteases to facilitate virus entry) in the nasal mucosa, composed of the respiratory mucosa (RM) and olfactory mucosa (OM), and the olfactory bulb (OB) in mouse and human tissues by immunohistochemistry and gene analyses. Results Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin gene expressions were confirmed in the nasal mucosa and OB. ACE2 was widely expressed all in the RM, OM and OB. Co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin was observed in the RM including the RE and subepithelial glands and in the OM, especially in the supporting cells on the olfactory epithelium and the Bowman\u2019s glands. Notably, the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the OM were positive for ACE2 but almost negative for TMPRSS2 and Furin. The cells in the OB expressed ACE2 strongly and Furin weakly and did not express TMPRSS2. Conclusions ACE2 was widely expressed in the RM, OM and OB, but TMPRSS2 and Furin were expressed in certain types of cells and were absent in the ORNs. These findings, together with clinically reported ones, suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural and central dysfunction and, to some extent, conductive olfactory dysfunction. That the ORNs express ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 or Furin may explain the early recovery of anosmia. Short Summary Protein expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS, and Furin suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural dysfunction without olfactory neuronal damage.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ueha, Rumi; Kondo, Kenji; Kagoya, Ryoji; Shichino, Shigeyuki; Ueha, Satoshi; Yamasoba, Tatsuya","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.097352","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bowman"],"organizations":["OB","OM","RE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["olfactory mucosa","distribution of ACE2","Results Ace2","Conclusions ACE2","induced olfactory dysfunction","ORNs express ACE2","conductive olfactory dysfunction","Furin weakly","olfactory epithelium","olfactory bulb","express TMPRSS2","Co-expression of ACE2","RM","unique pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction","Furin gene expressions","olfactory receptor neurons","respiratory mucosa","sensorineural dysfunction","Background Anosmia","related anosmia","olfactory neuronal damage","OB","nasal mucosa","central dysfunction","background mechanisms of COVID","Short Summary Protein expression patterns of ACE2","early recovery of anosmia","supporting cells","virus binding receptor","upper respiratory infection","certain types of cells","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","virus entry","coronavirus disease","gene analyses","Bowman\u2019s glands","subepithelial glands","small proportion of patients","human tissues","mouse","frequent symptom","immunohistochemistry","extent","SARS-CoV","proteases","existence","clinical figure","Methods","ones","findings","weeks","months"],"language":"en"},

Archived serum (n=34), serum from nucleic acid test (NAT)-positive subjects (n=4), and samples collected from NAT-positive community members (n=4) served to validate the assay. The range of anti-SARS/CoV-2 antibodies in archived and NAT-positive sera indicated need to compromise sensitivity or specificity. Accordingly, we set a cutoff of 4 SD above the mean for IgG and 3 SD above the mean for IgM to indicate that an individual had been exposed, and developed some degree of immunity, to SARS/CoV-2. The IgG cutoff clearly compromised sensitivity but offered high specificity, both of which were harder to gauge for IgM. Based on these cutoffs, excluding subjects whose participation resulted from self-suspected SARS/CoV-2 infection, we found 7.1% positivity for anti-SARS/CoV-2 IgG (3 of 127 subjects) or IgM (6 of 127). While we do not claim this small immune survey is broadly representative of metro Atlanta, and we have greater confidence in the IgG results, which had only 2.4% positivity, it nonetheless demonstrates that persons with antibodies to SARS/CoV-2, who\u0027ve not suspected they\u0027d been exposed to this virus, can readily be found in various Atlanta area neighborhoods (9 positives were in 8 zip codes). Accordingly, these results support the notion that dissemination of the virus is more widespread than testing would indicate but also suggests that most persons in metro Atlanta remain vulnerable to this virus.

Complete lockdown of the nation for 21 days and immediate isolation of infected cases are the proactive steps taken by the authorities. For a better understanding of the evolution of COVID-19 in the country, Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model is used in this paper. It is predicted that actual infectious population is ten times the reported positive case (quarantined) in the country. Also, a single case can infect 1.5 more individuals of the population.

We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish \u2018PANIC\u2019, thereby \u2018left-shifting\u2019 severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this novel Coronavirus. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon the SARS-CoV-2 triggering of the \u2018PANIC Attack\u2019. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons from which we can more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frohman, Elliot M.; Cruz, Roberto Alejandro; Longmuir, Reid; Steinman, Lawrence; Zamvil, Scott S.; Villemarette-Pittman, Nicole R.; Frohman, Teresa C.; Parsons, Matthew S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25ba212f9723594b8351c198b7080f9e3e71f075.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20302720; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20302720?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["course of severe COVID","mild","moderate COVID","immunotherapy hypothesis","severe variant","innovative treatment regimen","transition","potential treatment","preventative treatment intervention regimen","HDMTX-LR","SARS-CoV","intensive immunotherapy intervention hypothesis","disease","putative randomized controlled trial","context of randomized controlled trials","proposed hypothesis-driven questions","PANIC Attack","high-dose methotrexate","leucovorin","current pandemic","far-reaching ramifications","prevention","irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli","group majority","rigorous assessment","order","triggering","rescue","characterization","patients","yielding invaluable lessons","fact capable of exerting mitigating","pleiotropic properties","duology","novel Coronavirus","effects","application","available agent","challenge","global health","approaches","contention","features","Confirmation"],"language":"en"},

Design: Observational study and dynamic modelling using a sigmoidal mixed effects model. Setting: All hospitals where patients were admitted for COVID-19. Participants: All admitted patients from March 18, 2020 to April 17, 2020. Main outcome measures: Abstention and admission rate for COVID-19. Results: Mean abstention rate in 2020 among departments was 52.5%\u002B/-6.4 and had increased by a mean of 18.8% as compared with the 2014 election. There was a high degree of similarity of abstention between the two elections among the departments (p\u003C0.001). Among departments with a high outbreak intensity before the election, those with a higher participation were not affected by a significantly higher number of COVID-19 admissions after the elections. The sigmoidal model fitted the data from the different departments with a high degree of consistency. The covariate analysis showed that a significant association between participation and number of admitted patients was observed for both elections (2020: B=-5.36, p\u003C1e-9 and 2014: B=-3.15, p\u003C1e-6) contradicting a direct specific causation of the 2020 election. Participation was not associated with the position of the inflexion point suggesting no effect in the speed of spread. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the surrounding intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in France did not have any local impact on citizens participation to a national election.

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. Study design Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. Results In 5 of 316 (1.6%) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group vs. 2/37 (5.4%) vs. (3/244 (1.2%), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One (20%) subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic. Conclusion The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of a tertiary hospital in Germany is low (1.6%). The data indicate that the local hygiene standard might be effective.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korth, Johannes; Wilde, Benjamin; Dolff, Sebastian; Anastasiou, Olympia E.; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Jahn, Michael; Cordes, Sebastian; Ross, Birgit; Esser, Stefan; Lindemann, Monika; Kribben, Andreas; Dittmer, Ulf; Witzke, Oliver; Herrmann, Anke","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abbd06729b1f905f1e8e420dd9ec854afb341923.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301797; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301797?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","PCR"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["healthcare workers SARS-CoV","suspected SARS-CoV","group","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","overall seroprevalence of SARS","high-risk","low-risk","daily contact","healthcare systems","intermediated-risk","intermediate-risk","close contact","frequency of contact","COVID","patient contact","positive patients","infection","Germany","IgG antibodies","PCR","subject","tertiary hospital","clinical data","University Hospital Essen","admission","Study design Serum samples","vulnerable cohort","Abstract Background","local hygiene standard","severe respiratory manifestation","Conclusion","challenge","questionnaire","Results"],"language":"en"},

The preformed NC is thought to act as a template on which the viral envelope can be organized. In the present work we have characterized two SFV deletion mutants which did not assemble NCs in the cytoplasm but which instead appeared to form NCs at the PM simultaneously with virus budding. The deletions were introduced in a conserved 14 residue long linker peptide that joins the amino-terminal RNA-binding domain with the carboxy-terminal serine-protease domain of the capsid protein. Despite the deletions and the change in morphogenesis, wild-type (wt)-like particles were produced with almost wt efficiency.

In this study, we investigated the role of spleen macrophages in immunity against mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Previous studies showed that spleen and liver macrophages are the first target cells for infection by MHV-A59 in vivo, suggesting that they could be involved in the induction of immune responses against MHV-A59. We used a macrophage depletion technique to deplete macrophages in vivo and studied the induction of virus-specific antibody and cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses and non-immune resistance against MHV-A59 in normal and macrophage-depleted mice. Virus titres in spleen and liver increased rapidly in macrophage-depleted mice, resulting in death of mice within 4 days after infection. Elimination of macrophages before immunization with MHV-A59 resulted in increased virus-specific humoral and T-cell proliferative responses. However, virus-specific CTL responses were not altered in macrophage-depleted mice. Our results show that spleen macrophages are of major importance as scavenger cells during MHV-A59 infection and are involved in clearance of virus from the host. In addition, macrophages may be involved in the regulation of acquired immune responses. In the absence of macrophages, increased virus-specific T-cell and antibody responses are detectable, suggesting that macrophages suppress MHV-A59-specific T- and B-cell responses and that other cells serve as antigen-presenting cells.","publish_time":"1997-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wijburg, O L; Heemskerk, M H; Boog, C J; Van Rooijen, N","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1364066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-A59 infection","liver macrophages","virus-specific CTL responses","role of spleen macrophages","Elimination of macrophages","absence of macrophages","induction of virus","increased virus-specific T-cell","induction of immune responses","antibody responses","T-cell proliferative responses","increased virus-specific humoral","B-cell responses","clearance of virus","Virus titres","mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","macrophage-depleted mice","specific antibody","cytotoxic T-cell","scavenger cells","target cells","death of mice","non-immune resistance","immune defence mechanisms","macrophage depletion technique","immunity","major importance","maintenance","scavenging","phagocytic functions","immunization","Previous studies","days","regulation","host","antigen","results","study","addition"],"language":"en"},

The basic organization of an export complex can be divided into an active COPII-containing budding zone on a single ER cisterna, which is adjacent to budding zones found on distantly connected ER cisternae. These budding foci surround and face a central cluster of morphologically independent vesicular-tubular elements that contain COPI coats involved in retrograde transport.

To address their individual roles in ER to Golgi transport, we used stage specific in vitro transport assays to synchronize movement of cargo to and from pre-Golgi intermediates, and GDP- and GTP-restricted forms of Sar1 and ARF1 proteins to control coat recruitment. We find that COPII is solely responsible for export from the ER, is lost rapidly following vesicle budding and mediates a vesicular step required for the build-up of pre-Golgi intermediates composed of clusters of vesicles and small tubular elements. COPI is recruited onto pre-Golgi intermediates where it initiates segregation of the anterograde transported protein vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) from the retrograde transported protein p58, a protein which actively recycles between the ER and pre-Golgi intermediates.

To locate determinants for sorting of gp210 to the pore membrane, we constructed various cDNAs coding for wild-type, mutant, and chimeric gp210, and monitored localization of the expressed protein in 3T3 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using appropriate antibodies. The large cisternal domain of gp210 (95% of its mass) did not reveal any sorting determinants. Surprisingly, the TM of gp210 is sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. The CT also contains a sorting determinant, but it is weaker than that of the TM. We propose specific lateral association of the transmembrane helices of two proteins to yield either a gp210 homodimer or a heterodimer of gp210 and another protein. The cytoplasmically oriented tails of these dimers may bind cooperatively to the adjacent NPCs.

Several new lines of evidence demonstrate that bacterial isolation from sputum during acute exacerbation in many instances reflects a cause-effect relationship. Placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in exacerbations of COPD demonstrate significant clinical benefits of antibiotic treatment in moderate and severe episodes. However, in the multitude of antibiotic comparison trials, the choice of antibiotics does not appear to affect the clinical outcome, which can be explained by several methodological limitations of these trials. Recently, comparison trials with nontraditional end-points have shown differences among antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. Observational studies that have examined clinical outcome of exacerbations have repeatedly demonstrated certain clinical characteristics to be associated with treatment failure or early relapse. Optimal antibiotic selection for exacerbations has therefore incorporated quantifying the risk for a poor outcome of the exacerbation and choosing antibiotics differently for low risk and high risk patients, reserving the broader spectrum drugs for the high risk patients. Though improved outcomes in exacerbations with antibiotic choice based on such risk stratification has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, this approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.","publish_time":"2008-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siddiqi, Attiya; Sethi, Sanjay","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f4fc78e53396ab0573664ed3ff5d665751861f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2528209.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibiotic trials","treatment of exacerbations","exacerbations of COPD","clinical outcome of exacerbations","antibiotic choice","antibiotic resistance","multitude of antibiotic comparison trials","significant clinical benefits of antibiotic treatment","judicious antibiotic use","Optimal antibiotic selection","high risk patients","low risk","risk stratification","prospective controlled trials","choice of antibiotics","consequences of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","treatment failure","certain clinical characteristics","poor outcome","account concerns of disease heterogeneity","bacterial isolation","broader spectrum drugs","instances","sputum","approach","nontraditional end-points","differences","pathogenesis","new lines of evidence","etiology","severe episodes","improved outcomes","cause-effect relationship","early relapse","Observational studies","Placebo","understanding","methodological limitations","decade"],"language":"en"},

We studied the spatial distributions of simulated virus-laden respiratory droplets when human subjects wore facemasks and were exposed to regulatory viral droplets by conducting in vivo experiments in facemask use. METHODS: Transmission pathway of aerosols of Fluorescein-KCl solution through facemasks and protective efficiency of facemasks were examined by using normal surgical facemasks and two facemasks with exhaust valves (Facemask A) and exhaust holes (Facemask B) covered with the same surgical filters situated at the back of the facemasks. Fluorescein-KCl solution was sprayed onto the faces of participants wearing the facemasks and performing intermittent exercises on a treadmill in a climatic chamber. RESULTS: Experimental results showed that when droplets spread onto a person face-to-face over short distances, 92.3% to 99.5% of droplets were blocked by the front surface of the facemask, whereas only 0.5% to 7.7% of droplets reached the back of the facemask. Both facemasks A and B had near or over 99% protection efficiency, compared with that of 95.5% to 97% of surgical facemasks. Using the same filters as normal surgical masks, facemasks A and B provided more effective respiratory protection against communicable respiratory infections such as influenza and SARS by the location of the breathing pathway to the back of the facemasks.

Several public health initiatives [e.g., the United States (US) President\u0027s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the US President\u0027s Malaria Initiative] have been very successful at reducing mortality from priority diseases. A competently trained public health workforce that can operate multi-disease surveillance and response systems is necessary to build upon and sustain these successes and to address other public health problems. Sub-Saharan Africa appears to have weathered the recent global economic downturn remarkably well and its increasing middle class may soon demand stronger public health systems to protect communities. The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been the backbone of public health surveillance and response in the US during its 60 years of existence. EIS has been adapted internationally to create the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) in several countries. In the 1990s CDC and the Rockefeller Foundation collaborated with the Uganda and Zimbabwe ministries of health and local universities to create 2-year Public Health Schools Without Walls (PHSWOWs) which were based on the FETP model. In 2004 the FETP model was further adapted to create the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) in Kenya to conduct joint competency-based training for field epidemiologists and public health laboratory scientists providing a master\u0027s degree to participants upon completion. The FELTP model has been implemented in several additional countries in sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of 2010 these 10 FELTPs and two PHSWOWs covered 613 million of the 865 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and had enrolled 743 public health professionals. We describe the process that we used to develop 10 FELTPs covering 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa from 2004 to 2010 as a strategy to develop a locally trained public health workforce that can operate multi-disease surveillance and response systems.","publish_time":"2011-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nsubuga, Peter; Johnson, Kenneth; Tetteh, Christopher; Oundo, Joseph; Weathers, Andrew; Vaughan, James; Elbon, Suzanne; Tshimanga, Mufuta; Ndugulile, Faustine; Ohuabunwo, Chima; Evering-Watley, Michele; Mosha, Fausta; Oleribe, Obinna; Nguku, Patrick; Davis, Lora; Preacely, Nykiconia; Luce, Richard; Antara, Simon; Imara, Hiari; Ndjakani, Yassa; Doyle, Timothy; Espinosa, Yescenia; Kazambu, Ditu; Delissaint, Dieula; Ngulefac, John; Njenga, Kariuki","journal":"Pan Afr Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8871ee344c8ca239b4aa5077f5e438075663299b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3224071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3224071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIDS Relief","CDC","EIS","Rockefeller Foundation","FETP","FELTP"],"locations":["United States","Uganda","Zimbabwe","Kenya","sub-Saharan Africa","Sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["public health initiatives","public health professionals","public health problems","backbone of public health surveillance","stronger public health systems","trained public health workforce","public health laboratory scientists","year Public Health Schools","numerous public health challenges","sub-Saharan Africa","Zimbabwe ministries of health","response systems","FETP model","Field Epidemiology Training Program","multi-disease surveillance","Laboratory Training Program","US Centers","FELTP model","field epidemiologists","Disease Control","US President\u0027s Malaria Initiative","EIS","additional countries","FELTPs","PHSWOWs","joint competency-based training","s CDC","President\u0027s Emergency Plan","AIDS Relief","master\u0027s degree","United States","Kenya","inhabitants","local universities","increasing middle class","Uganda","Prevention","Walls","Rockefeller Foundation","participants","recent global economic downturn","Epidemic Intelligence Service","communities","mortality","priority diseases","completion","people","years of existence","strategy","successes","end","process"],"language":"en"},

When the Public Health School was started in 1994, the decision was taken to develop a 1 academic-year general MPH course. The persisting need for well-trained epidemiologists to support the public health surveillance, outbreak investigation and response system made the development of the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (FELTP) a national priority. The School of Public health and the Ministry of Health therefore requested the technical and financial assistance of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in organizing the Programme. The collaboration started by organizing short courses in disease outbreak investigations and response for serving Ghana Health Service staff. The success of the short courses led to development of the FELTP. By October 2007, the new FELTP curriculum for the award of a Masters of Philosophy in Applied Epidemiology and Disease Control was approved by the Academic Board of the University of Ghana and the programme started that academic year. Since then five cohorts of 37 residents have been enrolled in the two tracks of the programme. They consist of 12 physicians, 12 veterinarians and 13 laboratory scientists. The first two cohorts of 13 residents have graduated. The third cohort of seven has submitted dissertations and is awaiting the results. The fourth cohort has started the second year of field placement while the fifth cohort has just started the first semester. The field activities of the graduates have included disease outbreak investigations and response, evaluation of disease surveillance systems at the national level and analysis of datasets on diseases at the regional level. The residents have made a total of 25 oral presentations and 39 poster presentations at various regional and global scientific conferences. The Ghana FELTP (GFELTP) has promoted the introduction of the One Health concept into FELTP. It hosted the first USAID\u2013supported workshop in West Africa to further integrate and strengthen collaboration of the animal and human health sectors in the FETP model. GFELTP has also taken the lead in hosting the first AFENET Center for Training in Public Health Leadership and Management, through which the short course on Management for Improving Public Health Interventions was developed for AFENET member countries. The GFELTP pre-tested the Integrated Avian Influenza Outbreak and Pandemic Influenza course in preparation for introducing the materials into the curriculum of other FELTP in the network. The leadership positions to which the graduates of the program have been appointed in the human and animal Public Health Services, improvement in disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and response along with the testimony of the health authorities about their appreciation of the outputs of the graduates at various fora, is a strong indication that the GFELTP is meeting its objectives.","publish_time":"2011-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wurapa, Frederick; Afari, Ebenezer; Ohuabunwo, Chima; Sackey, Samuel; Clerk, Christine; Kwadje, Simon; Yebuah, Nathaniel; Amankwa, Joseph; Amofah, George; Appiah-Denkyira, Ebenezer","journal":"Pan Afr Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84db97911a7abce47876c5732ac570d78f253aaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3266674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ghana Ministry of Health","Public Health School","Laboratory Training Programme","United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","CDC","Ghana Health Service","FELTP","Applied Epidemiology and Disease Control","FETP","Integrated Avian Influenza Outbreak and Pandemic Influenza","Public Health Services"],"locations":["Ghana","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["public health surveillance","public health system","Public Health Leadership","Public Health School","School of Public health","Public Health Interventions","health authorities","Health concept","Ghana Ministry of Health","animal Public Health Services","Ghana FELTP","human health sectors","Ghana Health Service staff","disease outbreak investigations","Disease Control","response system","Field Epidemiology","graduates","University of Ghana","academic year","new FELTP curriculum","residents","evaluation of disease surveillance systems","Laboratory Training Programme","year of field placement","short courses","field activities","GFELTP pre-","trained field epidemiologists","Integrated Avian Influenza Outbreak","academic-year general MPH course","Pandemic Influenza course","Management","national level","regional level","development","Academic Board","collaboration","cohorts","poster presentations","various fora","well-trained epidemiologists","oral presentations","Applied Epidemiology","AFENET Center","national priority","laboratory scientists","leadership positions","AFENET member countries","improvement","United States Centers","financial assistance","analysis of datasets","Masters of Philosophy","outputs","global scientific conferences","diseases","award","Prevention","preparation","West Africa","USAID","supported workshop","strong indication","FETP model","appreciation","materials","CDC","testimony","Planning Unit","veterinarians","persisting need","total","lack","introduction","physicians","dissertations","success","network","results","semester","objectives","tracks","decision"],"language":"en"},

Other studies have demonstrated that the human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can cleave the HA of human seasonal influenza viruses. Consequently, we have investigated the use of human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 to produce high titre influenza haemmagglutinin (HA) lentiviral pseudotypes from Group 2 influenza viruses. Such pseudotypes represent powerful and safe tools to study viral entry and immune responses. Influenza pseudotype particles are obtained by co-transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells using plasmids coding for the influenza HA, HIV gag-pol and a lentiviral vector incorporating firefly luciferase. However, in order to produce Group 2 pseudotypes, it was necessary to co-transfect a plasmid expressing the TMPRSS2 endoprotease, to achieve the necessary HA cleavage for infective particle generation. These lentiviral pseudotypes were shown to transduce HEK293T/17 cells with high efficiency. This demonstrates that TMPRSS2 is necessary for the functional activation, in vitro, of both the HA of human seasonal influenza and other Group 2 HA influenza strains. Additionally, we show that the Group 2 influenza pseudotype particles can be used as surrogate antigens in neutralization assays and are efficiently neutralized by corresponding influenza virus reference sera. These data demonstrate that the viral pseudotype system is a powerful method for serological surveillance of a wide range of influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2013-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferrara, Francesca; Molesti, Eleonora; B\u00F6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00E4user, Eva; Cattoli, Giovanni; Corti, Davide; Scott, Simon D; Temperton, Nigel J","journal":"J Mol Genet Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6aaf920479e8c440f99cd8a14a3e9ebd9250d15f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3614188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614188/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Transmembrane Protease Serine","Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HA influenza strains","HA of human seasonal influenza viruses","Influenza pseudotype particles","monomer of influenza haemagglutinin","wide range of influenza viruses","Group","high titre influenza haemmagglutinin","lentiviral pseudotypes","necessary HA cleavage","corresponding influenza virus reference sera","use of human Transmembrane Protease Serine","co-transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293T","lentiviral vector","viral pseudotype system","cells","TMPRSS2 endoprotease","powerful method","viral entry","high efficiency","HIV gag-pol","serological surveillance","plasmids coding","safe tools","infective particle generation","surrogate antigens","maturation","single polypeptide precursor","neutralization assays","immune responses","firefly luciferase","proteases","data","functional activation","active subunits","studies","order"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic and anti-rotavirus properties of crude extracts of A. kellalensis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered flowers of Achillea kellalensis were extracted with hot water and ethanol 50% (v/v). The cell viability and toxicity of the extracts were evaluated on MA-104 cells using four methods; trypan blue dye, NR, crystal violet and MTT assay. The in vitro anti-rotavirus properties were determined via four different assays, in order to evaluate the direct inhibition and/or the inhibition of viral replication. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity of two A. kellalensis extracts showed different concentrations. Hydro-alcoholic extract had low CC(50) at 600 \u00B5g/mL by the NR assay while the aqueous extract had high CC(50) at 1000\u00B5g/mL by the crystal violet method. In the simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay, the extracts were able to prevent viral replication and inhibit the viral CPE on MA-104 cells at 10 TCID(50), but the extracts did not exhibit direct antiviral activity on rotavirus adsorption. The effective concentration (EC(50)) of both extracts was observed to be 100 \u00B5g/mL. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that A. kellalensis extracts exert potent anti-rotaviral activity only after viral adsorption. The two extracts from A. kellalensis showed a good selectivity index. Also these results suggest that extracts prepared from the flowers of A. kellalensis may be potential anti-rotaviral agents in vivo and be useful in veterinary medicine.","publish_time":"2013-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taherkhani, Reza; Farshadpour, Fatemeh; Makvandi, Manoochehr","journal":"Jundishapur J Nat Pharm Prod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a62951116b1815c48334c0caae599e4d4f06e58f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3941895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A. kellalensis"],"organizations":["MTT","NR","EC"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["kellalensis extracts","anti-rotavirus properties of crude extracts of","NR assay","rotavirus adsorption","powdered flowers of Achillea kellalensis","viral adsorption","cells","RESULTS","post treatment assay","simultaneous treatment assay","inhibition of viral replication","potent anti-rotaviral activity","MTT assay","bovine rotavirus","viral CPE","cell toxicity activity","direct antiviral activity","potential anti-rotaviral agents","METHODS","direct inhibition","treatment of acute diarrhea","crystal violet method","high CC","aqueous extract","antiviral activities","low CC","cell viability","veterinary medicine","different assays","different concentrations","traditional herbal medicine","Hydro-alcoholic extract","trypan blue dye","Southwest of Iran","order","1000\u00B5g","hot water","Chaharmahal va Bakhtiarians","good selectivity index","study","ethanol","Cytotoxicity","effective concentration","OBJECTIVES","aim","MATERIALS","TCID","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Kelei; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Ji, Wen; Liu, Mingxia; Tang, Zhenyu; Shi, Feng; Gao, Yang; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Junfeng; Shen, Dinggang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ab6ec8904663d9022d8b23471007b7cd5320d3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03832v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of COVID","automated severity assessment of COVID","chest CT images","D CT images","performance of severity assessment","CT image dataset","chest CT imaging","lung lobe segmentation","segmentation sub-network","multi-instance classification","real COVID","multi-task multi-instance deep network","input image","classification sub-network","D image patches","unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy","coronavirus disease","disease progression","UNet","variable infection regions","similar imaging biomarkers","synergistic learning framework","lungs","large inter-case variations","patch-level encoder","results","proposed method","great need of intensive clinical care","cases","effectiveness","essential role","patients","state-of-the-art methods","bag","Extensive experiments","specific slice","end","infections","context information"],"language":"en"},

Our model contains at most two fitting parameters, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data, which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down measures begin to take effect. Before these measures, our model predicts exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the first \u0060Situation report\u0027 (21 January 2020 $-$ day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people, taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures can be maintained, our model predicts power law growth from day 69 onward. Such growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population) have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak in the daily number of new cases that would occur in the absence of any interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of the disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world economy.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Botha, Andr\u0027e E.; Dednam, Wynand","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cf12ba53d54e87f9356435425ea1cde99e46328.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10532v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["day","measures","global number of new cases","daily number of new cases","total number of cases","power-law growth","power law growth","global spread","global population","original exponential growth pattern","current lock","coronavirus disease","world health organisation","sufficient number of people","dimensional iterative map model","world economy","available data","initial data","large peak","devastating impact","immunity","good fit","decades","date","severity","scenario","Situation report","duration","fitting parameters","absence","interventions","lives","effect","middle"],"language":"en"},

One of the widely used mathematical models of long-term spreading of epidemics are the so-called deterministic compartmental models (SIR/SEIR type models). One of the main purposes of applying such models is to assess how the expensive restriction measures imposed by the authorities (home and social isolation/quarantine, travel restrictions, etc.) can effectively reduce the control reproduction number of the disease and its transmission risk. However the classical SIR/SEIR models have been primarily studied in what may be called stationary case, where the main parameters, the Transmission rate Beta (reflecting the virus spread by infected individuals) and the Removed rate Gamma (reflecting the hospitalization/isolation measures) remain constant during the whole period of interest. Hence, it is important to extend the classical SIR/SEIR models by creating new ansatzes for the dynamics of the transmission rates Beta(t) (which we will call further just Beta) and removed rates Gamma(t) (which we will call further just Gamma). The main purpose of the present research is to introduce a spline-based SEIR model with Time-varying Beta and Gamma parameters, or abbreviated TVBG-SEIR model, which is used to estimate the practical implications of the public health interventions and measures. We have designed a Tool based on the TVBG-SEIR model, which may be used as a Decision Support Tool to assist the health decision- and policy-makers in creating predictive scenarios.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kounchev, Ognyan; Simeonov, Georgi; Kuncheva, Zhana","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de3c922efb6cd2e9d1a6cc9ab5e586a63eab3b4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11338v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SEIR models","SEIR type models","Transmission rate Beta","Gamma parameters","abbreviated TVBG-SEIR model","transmission rates Beta","spline-based SEIR model","rates Gamma","mathematical models of long-term spreading of epidemics","Removed rate Gamma","so-called deterministic compartmental models","main parameters","classical SIR","isolation measures","Time-varying Beta","health decision","type of disease interventions","transmission risk","main purposes","public health interventions","Decision Support Tool","expensive restriction measures","social isolation","long-term global evolution of epidemics","authorities","hospitalization","quarantine","policy-makers","home","virus","dynamics","new ansatzes","infected individuals","outbreak","travel restrictions","present research","practical implications","critical information","control reproduction number","predictive scenarios","potential","stationary case","intensity","severity","period"],"language":"en"},

This PhD thesis is motivated by the study of epidemiological models applied to infectious diseases in an Optimal Control perspective, giving particular relevance to Dengue. Dengue is a subtropical and tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, that affects about 100 million people per year and is considered by the World Health Organization a major concern for public health. The mathematical models developed and tested in this work, are based on ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics underlying the disease, including the interaction between humans and mosquitoes. An analytical study is made related to equilibrium points, their stability and basic reproduction number. The spreading of Dengue can be attenuated through measures to control the transmission vector, such as the use of specific insecticides and educational campaigns. Since the development of a potential vaccine has been a recent global bet, models based on the simulation of a hypothetical vaccination process in a population are proposed. Based on Optimal Control theory, we have analyzed the optimal strategies for using these controls, and respective impact on the reduction/eradication of the disease during an outbreak in the population, considering a bioeconomic approach. The formulated problems are numerically solved using direct and indirect methods. The first discretize the problem turning it into a nonlinear optimization problem.

For such a large-scale epidemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent studies have shown that one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable non-contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those potential patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory data capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our researchers. This work demonstrates that the proposed portable and intelligent health screening device can be used as a pre-scan method for respiratory infections, which may help fight the current COVID-19 epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Zheng; Hu, Menghan; Fan, Lei; Pan, Yaling; Tang, Wei; Zhai, Guangtao; Lu, Yong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c588fca3c13303f444f545a5ad5318bdf5ff460.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06912v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RGB","GRU","Ruijin Hospital Affiliated","The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","abnormal respiratory data","respiratory characteristics","abnormal respiratory status","respiratory data capture technique","health status","health condition of people","masks","health screening result","large-scale epidemic","intelligent health screening device","healthy people","current COVID","potential patients of COVID","serious global epidemic","thermal camera","important feature of COVID","pre-scan method","pre-inspection","portable non-contact method","thermal videos","viral infections","dual-mode camera","isolation of potential virus carriers","early detection","attention mechanism","past","months","Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School","Ruijin Hospital","huge loss","bidirectional GRU neural network","deep learning architecture","practical scenarios","combination","analysis","schools","RGB","FLIR","model","human society","Android phone","hospitals","spread","face recognition","accuracy","results of validation experiments","Recent studies","paper","risk","Coronavirus Disease","researchers","real-world dataset"],"language":"en"},

Our economic model is designed to address the unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption. We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects, and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare, and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pichler, Anton; Pangallo, Marco; Rio-Chanona, R.

Using the theory of controlled rough paths, we derive a class of rough geophysical fluid dynamics (RGFD) models as critical points of rough action functionals. These RGFD models characterize Lagrangian trajectories in fluid dynamics as geometric rough paths (GRP) on the manifold of diffeomorphic maps. Three constrained variational approaches are formulated for the derivation of these models. The first is the Clebsch formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as rough advection laws. The second is the Hamilton-Pontryagin formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as right-invariant rough vector fields. The third is the Euler--Poincar\\\u0027e formulation in which the variations are constrained. These variational principles lead directly to the Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics on geometric rough paths. The GRP framework preserves the geometric structure of fluid dynamics obtained by using Lie group reduction to pass from Lagrangian to Eulerian variational principles, thereby yielding a rough formulation of the Kelvin circulation theorem. The rough-path variational approach includes non-Markovian perturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory effects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice of the rough path (e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the special case when the rough path is a realization of a semimartingale, we recover the SGFD models in Holm (2015). However, by eliminating the need for stochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the Lagrangian trajectories. In contrast, the Lagrangian trajectories in the stochastic framework are described by stochastic integrals which do not have a pathwise interpretation. Thus, the rough path formulation restores this property.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crisan, Dan; Holm, Darryl D.; Leahy, James-Michael; Nilssen, Torstein","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/942d816e1da4d47395c2378fed18587303850b3c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07829v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RGFD","GRP","SGFD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rough formulation","rough path formulation","geometric rough paths","rough-path variational approach","Lagrangian fluid trajectories","rough advection laws","class of rough geophysical fluid dynamics","Lagrangian trajectories","theory of controlled rough paths","e formulation","Clebsch formulation","invariant rough vector fields","Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics","geometric structure of fluid dynamics","critical points of rough action functionals","RGFD models","stochastic framework","stochastic variational tools","Hamilton-Pontryagin formulation","Eulerian variational principles","constrained variational approaches","GRP framework","SGFD models","new framework","constraints","realization","stochastic integrals","pathwise interpretation","Lie group reduction","non-Markovian perturbations","parametrization schemes","semimartingale","Kelvin circulation theorem","judicious choice","fractional Brownian motion","manifold of diffeomorphic maps","Poincar","need","derivation","special case","property","memory effects","paper","Holm","variations","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kohler, J.; Schwenkel, L.; Koch, A.; Berberich, J.; Pauli, P.; Allgower, F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bc0c7490f95cf3ea2f5cdf7bf1b0555ab19b917.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03580v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPC"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["stronger social distancing measures","model mismatch","validation model","tailored model","model predictive control","stricter measures","minimum number of fatalities","excessive social costs","adaptive feedback strategies","robust MPC-based feedback policy","assumption of exact model knowledge","feedback strategy","simpler policies","German COVID","outbreak","adaptive strategies","open-loop optimal control policy","simpler ones","well-designed policies","interval arithmetic","measurements","uncertain data","years","realistic scenario","various recent studies","theoretical findings","course","level","pandemic","infection rates","different parameter","long run","deviant parameters","later time","example of Germany","analysis","reliable performance","goal","approach"],"language":"en"},

For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is \u0027just another app\u0027 which takes only minutes to use.

Outbreaks of drug-resistant pathogens are ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wild-type strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.","publish_time":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meehan, Michael T.; Cope, Robert C.; McBryde, Emma S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e50fa33d0a5572161f11913899f23b1aefafde45.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05010v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["invading strain","new strain","background endemic strain","existing endemic strain","novel disease strain","past instances of successful strain invasion","thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions","Outbreaks of drug","emergence","past work","fit novel strains","rise of antimicrobial drug resistance","resistant pathogens","epidemic outbreaks","wild-type strains","valuable lessons","imminent threat","probability","transmission of mutant variants","survival prospects","magnitude","populations","reproduction number relative","branching process approximation","order","global health","stochastic dynamics","accompanying findings","understanding","differential control scenarios","ratio","considerable attention","modelling communities","critical determinant","mechanisms","analogy","analysis","circumstances","community"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, we introduce three right handed neutrinos to cancel the $[U(1)_{\\rm B-L}]^3$ anomaly. However, it suffices to introduce two heavy right-handed neutrinos for these purposes and therefore we can replace one right-handed neutrino by new chiral fermions to cancel the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge anomaly. Then, one of the chiral fermions can naturally play a role of a dark matter candidate. In this paper, we demonstrate how this framework produces a dark matter candidate which can address the so-called\u0022core-cusp problem\u0022. As one of the small scale problems that $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm encounters, it may imply an important clue for a nature of dark matter. One of resolutions among many is hypothesizing that sub-keV fermion dark matter halos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are in (quasi) degenerate configuration.

In particular the region Lombardia has a behaviour very fast with respect to the other ones.

Governments have taken several measures to work around this shortage: the FDA has become more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to 100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program. However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost. However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy. Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine learning or clinical examinations. The resulting algorithms, which can be interpreted as informed divide-and-conquer strategies, are non-intuitive and quite surprising. They are patent-free.

We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global spread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the local spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a simulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available data on population, population density, and traffic networks between different regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly improve the results of modeling disease spread.","publish_time":"2010-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoneyama, Teruhiko; Das, Sanmay; Krishnamoorthy, Mukkai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82a67864aca77dd31253eda8ba90792b0395b181.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.4523v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of pandemics","global spread of infection","local spread of infections","results of modeling disease spread","spread of SARS pandemic","modeling of pandemics","global traffic patterns","global scale","hybrid model","population density","SEIR models","traffic networks","simple models","different regions","local conditions","large-scale difference equation models","infectious disease","SIR","detailed micro-level simulations","damage","international relationships","simulation study","connections","immense disruption","available data","communities","societies","factors","paper"],"language":"en"},

The human DEAD-box protein 1 (DDX1) plays an important role in tRNA and mRNA processing, is involved in tumor progression and is also hijacked by several virus families such as HIV-1 for replication and nuclear export. Although important in many cellular processes, the mechanism of DDX1\u2032s enzymatic function is unknown. We have performed equilibrium titrations and transient kinetics to determine affinities for nucleotides and RNA. We find an exceptional tight binding of DDX1 to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), one of the strongest affinities observed for DEAD-box helicases. ADP binds tighter by three orders of magnitude when compared to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), arresting the enzyme in a potential dead-end ADP conformation under physiological conditions. We thus suggest that a nucleotide exchange factor leads to DDX1 recycling. Furthermore, we find a strong cooperativity in binding of RNA and ATP to DDX1 that is also reflected in ATP hydrolysis. We present a model in which either ATP or RNA binding alone can partially shift the equilibrium from an \u2018open\u2019 to a \u2018closed\u2019-state; this shift appears to be not further pronounced substantially even in the presence of both RNA and ATP as the low rate of ATP hydrolysis does not change.","publish_time":"2015-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kellner, Julian N.; Reinstein, Jochen; Meinhart, Anton","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb93befc89c6e31c873386d95150e87dfd849e73.json; document_parses/pdf_json/58f660cec9eb4423fc12e1b14bc70a951a5edad0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4357711.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690890/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","ADP","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of RNA","RNA binding","RNA helicases","mechanism of DDX1","DDX1 recycling","DEAD-box helicases","exceptional tight binding of DDX1","low rate of ATP hydrolysis","DEAD-box protein family","human DEAD-box protein","shift","largest group of helicases","potential dead-end ADP conformation","adenosine diphosphate","adenosine triphosphate","strongest affinities","important role","equilibrium titrations","mRNA processing","physiological conditions","transient kinetics","s enzymatic function","enzyme","HIV","tRNA","orders of magnitude","nucleotide exchange factor","cellular processes","nucleotides","strong cooperativity","replication","nuclear export","tumor progression","virus families","model","presence","state"],"language":"en"},

However, these tests are often difficult to implement in a resource limited setting because of high cost. In this study, we developed and validated a method for simultaneous testing of common respiratory pathogens (Respanel) by real-time PCR in a convenient, strip-tube array format. Primers and probes for sixteen PCR assays were selected from the literature or newly designed. Following optimization of individual PCR assays, strip-tube arrays were prepared by dispensing primer-probe mixes (PPM) into two sets of 8-tube strips. Nucleic acid extracts from specimens were mixed with PCR master mix, and dispensed column-wise into 2 \u00D7 8-wells of a 96-well plate. PPMs from strip-tubes were then added to the wells using a multichannel pipette for real-time PCR. Individual PCR assays were optimized using previously known specimens (n = 394) with 91%\u2013100% concordance with culture, DFA or PCR results. Respanel was then tested in a routine manner at two different sites using specimens (n = 147) previously tested by Qiagen Resplex I\u0026II or Fast-Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 assays. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Respanel were 94%, 95% and 95%, respectively, against Resplex and 88%, 100% and 99%, respectively, against FTDRP21. Respanel detected more pathogens (p \u003C 0.05) than Resplex but the rate of pathogen detection was not significantly different from FTDRP21. Respanel is a convenient and inexpensive assay that is more sensitive than Resplex and comparable to FTDRP21 for the detection of common respiratory pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Al Mana, Hassan; Young, Virginia; Tang, Patrick; Thomas, Eva; Tan, Rusung; Tilley, Peter","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f150b427214181147bd4738796e6a4139a7821e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113679.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418305469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578898/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.12.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418305469","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","DFA","Qiagen Resplex","Fast-Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens","Resplex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time PCR","PCR results","optimization of individual PCR assays","detection of common respiratory pathogens","simultaneous detection of pathogens","Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens","PCR master mix","accuracy of Respanel","FTDRP21","simultaneous testing of common respiratory pathogens","respiratory infections","Qiagen Resplex","strip-tube arrays","different chemistries","different sites","strip-tube array format","Abstract Commercial multiplex assays","known specimens","strip-tubes","tube strips","wells","rate of pathogen detection","dispensing primer-probe mixes","platforms","resource limited setting","dispensed column-wise","inexpensive assay","high cost","sets","culture","DFA","routine manner","method","multichannel pipette","Nucleic acid extracts","sensitivity","specificity","concordance","literature","Primers","probes","PPMs","tests","plate","study"],"language":"en"},

It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. RESULTS: The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test. CONCLUSION: In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Ming; Yang, Lihui; Chen, Xuefu; Deng, Yiyu; Yang, Shifang; Xu, Hanyi; Chen, Zixing; Gao, Xinglin","journal":"Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b974706d8364e8f0c7d184ffdb0d331b0425b86f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219423.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405162/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611120301669?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611120301669","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contacts","asymptomatic COVID","asymptomatic SARS-CoV","family members","infectivity of asymptomatic carriers","asymptomatic patient","sign of COVID","virus carriers","original diseases of patients","days","hospital staffs","clinical records","ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease","Cardiovascular disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","auxiliary examination results","present clinical characteristics","new respiratory symptoms","median contact time","therapeutic schedules","epidemiological information","fever","subjects","BACKGROUND","CT images","nucleic acid test","case","infections","research","summary","MATERIAL","METHODS","blood counts","normal range","groups","quarantine","CONCLUSION","world"],"language":"en"},

Lung tissues were examined 3h, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14, and 42days (d) post-exposure. Global gene expression and pulmonary inflammation were assessed. DNA damage was evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and lung tissue using the comet assay. Increased neutrophil influx was observed at all time-points. DNA strand breaks were increased in BAL cells 3h post-exposure, and in lung tissues 2\u20135d post-exposure. Approximately 2600 genes were differentially expressed (\u00B11.5 fold; p\u22640.05) across all time-points in the lungs of exposed mice. Altered transcript levels were associated with immune-inflammatory response and acute phase response pathways, consistent with the BAL profiles and expression changes found in common respiratory infectious diseases. Genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and muscle contraction were also differentially expressed. Gene expression changes associated with inflammatory response followed a biphasic pattern, with initial changes at 3h post-exposure declining to base-levels by 3d, increasing again at 14d, and then persisting to 42d post-exposure. Thus, this single CBNP exposure that was equivalent to nine 8-h working days at the current Danish occupational exposure limit induced biphasic inflammatory response in gene expression that lasted until 42d post-exposure, raising concern over the chronic effects of CBNP exposure.","publish_time":"2015-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Husain, Mainul; Kyjovska, Zdenka O.; Bourdon-Lacombe, Julie; Saber, Anne T.; Jensen, Keld A.; Jacobsen, Nicklas R.; Williams, Andrew; Wallin, H\u00E5kan; Halappanavar, Sabina; Vogel, Ulla; Yauk, Carole L.","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03181d67b5bb019d1a6ba55fdebfe82763453a6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103116.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X15301307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26551751/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041008X15301307; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2015.11.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["d post-exposure","h post-exposure","biphasic inflammatory response","single CBNP exposure","immune-inflammatory response","Lung tissues","Gene expression changes","chronic effects of CBNP exposure","time-points","Global gene expression","detailed evolution of lung inflammatory responses","current Danish occupational exposure limit","BAL cells","time-series","acute phase response pathways","BAL profiles","initial changes","pulmonary inflammation","time course data","DNA repair","\u03BCg CBNPs","days","DNA damage","genes","DNA strand breaks","biphasic pattern","lungs of exposed mice","Altered transcript levels","Increased neutrophil influx","cell cycle regulation","apoptosis","concern","Abstract Inhalation of carbon black nanoparticles","bronchoalveolar lavage","common respiratory infectious diseases","muscle contraction","comet assay","vehicle controls","Female C57BL","fold"],"language":"en"},

These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. METHODS: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph\u2019s vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. RESULTS: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Wasim; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Downing, Joseph; L\u00F3pez Segu\u00ED, Francesc","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205032.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352383/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19458","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YouTube"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G conspiracy theory","G COVID","social network analysis","popular theory","social media users","spread of COVID","handful of users","Influential users","context of COVID","content analysis of Twitter data","social media platforms","drivers of fake news","G towers","nonconspiracy theory supporters","study","social network graph clusters","fake news websites","humorous tweets","general tweets","sample tweets","rebate misinformation","sources of fake information","largest network structures","personal views","web sources","paper","inappropriate content","United Kingdom","understanding","popular web source","quick policies","isolates group","combination of quick","broadcast group","online platforms","sole aim","efforts of isolating opinions","link baiting","various conspiracies","ability","graph\u2019s vertices","health authorities","practical guidance","betweenness centrality score","Clauset-Newman","targeted interventions","strategies","increased discussions","high volume","nodes","Moore algorithm","rumors","account","profile","burning","RESULTS","authority figure","day period","coronavirus disease","beginning","lack","impact","conversations","policymakers","pandemic","CONCLUSIONS","keys","GCoronavirus hashtag","topics","YouTube videos","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","BACKGROUND","size","future","world"],"language":"en"},

The GISRS has also worked to continually monitor and assess the risk posed by potential pandemic viruses and to guide appropriate public health responses. \u2022 The expanded and enhanced role of the GISRS following the adoption of the International Health Regulations (2005), recognition of the continuing threat posed by avian H5N1 and the aftermath of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provide an opportune time to critically review the process by which influenza vaccine viruses are selected. In addition to identifying potential areas for improvement, such a review will also help to promote greater appreciation by the wider influenza and policy\u2010making community of the complexity of influenza vaccine virus selection. \u2022 The selection process is highly coordinated and involves continual year\u2010round integration of virological data and epidemiological information by National Influenza Centres (NICs), thorough antigenic and genetic characterization of viruses by WHO Collaborating Centres (WHOCCs) as part of selecting suitable candidate vaccine viruses, and the preparation of suitable reassortants and corresponding reagents for vaccine standardization by WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs). \u2022 Ensuring the optimal effectiveness of vaccines has been assisted in recent years by advances in molecular diagnosis and the availability of more extensive genetic sequence data. However, there remain a number of challenging constraints including variations in the assays used, the possibility of complications resulting from non\u2010antigenic changes, the limited availability of suitable vaccine viruses and the requirement for recommendations to be made up to a year in advance of the peak of influenza season because of production constraints. \u2022 Effective collaboration and coordination between human and animal influenza networks is increasingly recognized as an essential requirement for the improved integration of data on animal and human viruses, the identification of unusual influenza A viruses infecting human, the evaluation of pandemic risk and the selection of candidate viruses for pandemic vaccines. \u2022 Training workshops, assessments and donations have led to significant increases in trained laboratory personnel and equipment with resulting expansion in both geographical surveillance coverage and in the capacities of NICs and other laboratories. This has resulted in a significant increase in the volume of information reported to WHO on the spread, intensity and impact of influenza. In addition, initiatives such as the WHO Shipment Fund Project have facilitated the timely sharing of clinical specimens and virus isolates and contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the global distribution and temporal circulation of different viruses. It will be important to sustain and build upon the gains made in these and other areas. \u2022 Although the haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is likely to remain the assay of choice for the antigenic characterization of viruses in the foreseeable future, alternative assays \u2013 for example based upon advanced recombinant DNA and protein technologies \u2013 may be more adaptable to automation. Other technologies such as microtitre neuraminidase inhibition assays may also have significant implications for both vaccine virus selection and vaccine development. \u2022 Microneutralization assays provide an important adjunct to the HAI assay in virus antigenic characterization. Improvements in the use and potential automation of such assays should facilitate large\u2010scale serological studies, while other advanced techniques such as epitope mapping should allow for a more accurate assessment of the quality of a protective immune response and aid the development of additional criteria for measuring immunity. \u2022 Standardized seroepidemiological surveys to assess the impact of influenza in a population could help to establish well\u2010characterized banks of age\u2010stratified representative sera as a national, regional and global resource, while providing direct evidence of the specific benefits of vaccination. \u2022 Advances in high\u2010throughput genetic sequencing coupled with advanced bioinformatics tools, together with more X\u2010ray crystallographic data, should accelerate understanding of the genetic and phenotypic changes that underlie virus evolution and more specifically help to predict the influence of amino acid changes on virus antigenicity. \u2022 Complex mathematical modelling techniques are increasingly being used to gain insights into the evolution and epidemiology of influenza viruses. However, their value in predicting the timing and nature of future antigenic and genetic changes is likely to be limited at present. The application of simpler non\u2010mechanistic statistical algorithms, such as those already used as the basis of antigenic cartography, and phylogenetic modelling are more likely to be useful in facilitating vaccine virus selection and in aiding assessment of the pandemic potential of avian and other animal influenza viruses. \u2022 The adoption of alternative vaccine technologies \u2013 such as live\u2010attenuated, quadrivalent or non\u2010HA\u2010based vaccines \u2013 has significant implications for vaccine virus selection, as well as for vaccine regulatory and manufacturing processes. Recent collaboration between the GISRS and vaccine manufacturers has resulted in the increased availability of egg isolates and high\u2010growth reassortants for vaccine production, the development of qualified cell cultures and the investigation of alternative methods of vaccine potency testing. WHO will continue to support these and other efforts to increase the reliability and timeliness of the global influenza vaccine supply. \u2022 The WHO GISRS and its partners are continually working to identify improvements, harness new technologies and strengthen and sustain collaboration.

Naturally occurring protease inhibitors like cystatins, especially cystatin C (cys C), are abundantly present in human seminal plasma. Although its antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been demonstrated, the role of this protein against HIV is not well studied. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-HIV activities of cys C, which is present innately in the male reproductive tract. METHODS: Protein-protein interaction of cys C with various HIV proteins was studied using a commercially available HIV blot and specific interaction with HIV protease was studied by dot-blot technique using commercially available cys C. To purify biologically active cys C from human seminal plasma to be used for subsequent experiments, gel-permeation chromatography followed by affinity chromatography was used. The HIV infectivity inhibition activity of the purified cystatin C was tested in TZM-bl cells. To study its activity on HIV protease, time-course enzyme kinetics studies were performed using spectrometric assay. RESULTS: Cystatin C reacted with some HIV proteins including HIV protease. Biologically active cys C was purified using gel permeation chromatography followed by affinity chromatography. When tested in TZM-bl cells, purified cystatin C demonstrated HIV-infectivity inhibitory activity (IC(50): 0.28 \u03BCM). Enzyme kinetic studies demonstrated that it abrogated the action of HIV protease on its substrate. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrate that cystatin C possesses anti-HIV activities.

The antiviral function of IFN is mainly exerted by activating the JAK/STAT signalling and subsequently inducing IFN\u2010stimulated gene (ISG) production. However, the mechanism by which IAV combat the type I IFN signalling pathway is not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the roles of human microRNAs modulated by IAV infection in type I IFN responses. We demonstrated that microRNA\u201030 (miR\u201030) family members were downregulated by IAV infection. Our data showed that the forced expression of miR\u201030 family members inhibited IAV proliferation, while miR\u201030 family member inhibitors promoted IAV proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that miR\u201030 family members targeted and reduced SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, and thus relieved their inhibiting effects on IFN/JAK/STAT signalling pathway. In addition, miR\u201030 family members inhibited the expression of NEDD4, a negative regulator of IFITM3, which is important for host defence against influenza viruses. Our findings suggest that IAV utilises a novel strategy to restrain host type I IFN\u2010mediated antiviral immune responses by decreasing the expression of miR\u201030 family members, and add a new way to understand the mechanism of immune escape caused by influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2019-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Xian; Yu, Shiman; Ren, Peilei; Sun, Xiaomei; Jin, Meilin","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ad35815b1c3ec5d6b964d6d6b9465ebd555a0da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162240.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31876380/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.13150","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","IFN","JAK/STAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["family members","IFN responses","IAV infection","IAV proliferation","IFN signalling pathway","forced expression of miR","antiviral function of IFN","host type","family member inhibitors","expression of NEDD4","SOCS3 expression","influenza viruses","antiviral immune responses","STAT signalling pathway","JAK","mechanism of immune escape","host defence","interferon","reduced SOCS1","novel strategy","negative regulator of IFITM3","stimulated gene","multiple mechanisms","roles of human microRNAs","ISG","new way","inhibiting effects","production","addition","data","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Flowsight\u00AE Imaging Flow Cytometry was employed for the detection of DPP4 and immunophenotyping. DPP4 enzymatic activity was measured by a DPPIV-Glo\u2122 Protease Assay kit. FINDINGS: Human monocytes expressed a moderate level of membrane-bound DPP4. Obese patients with body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 had a higher level of monocyte DPP4 expression, in parallel with higher levels of HOMA-IR, blood glucose, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol, compared to those in the non-obese (BMI \u003C 30) patients.

However, both techniques have difficulties to identify viruses in clinical samples because of the host genomic nucleic acid content (hg/cont). Both propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) have the capacity to bind free DNA/RNA, but are cell membrane-impermeable. Thus, both are unable to bind protected nucleic acid such as viral genomes within intact virions. However, EMA/PMA modified genetic material cannot be amplified by enzymes. In order to assess the potential of EMA/PMA to lower the presence of amplifiable hg/cont in samples and improve virus detection, serum and lung tissue homogenates were spiked with porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) and were processed with EMA/PMA. In addition, PRRSV RT-qPCR positive clinical samples were also tested. EMA/PMA treatments significantly decreased amplifiable hg/cont and significantly increased the number of PVDA positive probes and their signal intensity compared to untreated spiked lung samples. EMA/PMA treatments also increased the sensitivity of HTS by increasing the number of specific PRRSV reads and the PRRSV percentage of coverage. Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments significantly increased the sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in two out of three clinical tissue samples. Thus, EMA/PMA treatments offer a new approach to lower the amplifiable hg/cont in clinical samples and increase the success of PVDA and HTS to identify viruses.","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bellehumeur, Christian; Boyle, Brian; Charette, Steve J.; Harel, Jos\u00E9e; L\u2019Homme, Yvan; Masson, Luke; Gagnon, Carl A.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eee57907d64046a6a8426a4031a0b6d6e04a0c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119533.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.06.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26129867/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341500230X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341500230X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMA/PMA","PVDA","HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PMA treatments","potential of EMA","clinical tissue samples","PRRSV RT-qPCR positive clinical samples","sensitivity of PVDA","sensitivity of HTS","untreated spiked lung samples","presence of amplifiable hg","success of PVDA","number of specific PRRSV","number of PVDA positive probes","PRRSV percentage of coverage","protected nucleic acid","lung tissue homogenates","viral genomes","virus detection","respiratory virus","free DNA","novel viruses of emerging diseases","propidium monoazide","host genomic nucleic acid content","Abstract Pan-viral DNA array","ethidium bromide monoazide","signal intensity","useful tools","serum","high-throughput sequencing","new approach","RNA","capacity","addition","genetic material","difficulties","intact virions","cell membrane-impermeable","enzymes","techniques","order"],"language":"en"},

Increasing evidence suggests that virus\u2013virus interactions are common and may be critical to understanding viral pathogenesis in natural hosts. In this review we propose a system for classifying virus\u2013virus interactions by organizing them into three main categories: (1) direct interactions of viral genes or gene products, (2) indirect interactions that result from alterations in the host environment, and (3) immunological interactions. We have so far identified 15 subtypes of interaction and assigned each to one of these categories. It is anticipated that this framework will provide for a more systematic approach to investigating virus\u2013virus interactions, both at the cellular and organismal levels.","publish_time":"2010-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"DaPalma, T.; Doonan, B.P.; Trager, N.M.; Kasman, L.M.","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/222700accc067b505b8a2a715027daf1c9b30310.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172858.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093154/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210000055; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.01.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210000055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus interactions","strain of virus","indirect interactions","immunological interactions","direct interactions of viral genes","result","prior infection","course of infection","viral pathogenesis","main categories","subtypes of interaction","gene products","different species","measurable difference","alterations","systematic approach","natural hosts","evidence","host environment","organismal levels","framework","review","chance"],"language":"en"},

Infection inhibition assay results showed that an antibody against RVFV inhibited the infective ability of the RVFV pseudoviruses, and an antibody neutralization assay for RVFV detection was then established.

Nonetheless, respiratory infections or outbreaks due to HAdV21 have never been reported in China. MinION and Illumina platforms were employed to identify the potential pathogen from a throat swab. Discrepancies between MinION and Illumina sequencing were validated and corrected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genomic characterization and recombinant event detection were then performed. Among the 35,466 high-quality MinION reads, a total of 5,999 reads (16.91%) could be aligned to HAdV21 reference genomes (genome sizes \u224835.3 kb), among which 20 had a length of \u003E30 kb. A genome sequence assembled from MinION reads was further classified as HAdV subtype 21a. Random downsampling revealed as few as 500 nanopore reads could cover \u226596.49% of current genome. Illumina sequencing displayed good consistency (pairwise nucleotide identity = 99.91%) with MinION sequencing but with 31 discrepancies that were further validated and confirmed by PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing. Restriction enzymes such as BamHI and KpnI were able to distinguish the present genome from HAdV21 prototype and HAdV21b. Phylogenetic analysis employing whole-genome sequences placed our genome with members only from subtype 21a. Common features among HAdV21a strains were identified, including polymorphisms discovered in penton and 100 kDa hexon assembly\u2013associated proteins and a recombinant event in the E4 gene. Using MinION and Illumina sequencers, we identified the first HAdV21a strain from China, which could provide key genomic data for disease control and epidemiological investigations.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Fuqiang; Han, Yifang; Zhu, Juanjuan; Li, Peng; Zhang, Qi; Lin, Yanfeng; Wang, Taiwu; Lv, Heng; Wang, Changjun; Wang, Chunhui; Zhang, Jinhai","journal":"Front Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d36651a67f5ccbc7787cccee7c0c63e751f4543.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7155751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318094/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina","Random","PCR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["MinION sequencing","MinION reads","Illumina sequencing","present genome","genome sequences","genome sizes","current genome","high-quality MinION","HAdV21 prototype","Sanger sequencing","Illumina platforms","Illumina sequencers","nanopore reads","HAdV21 reference genomes","PCR","China","Discrepancies","recombinant event detection","Genomic characterization","HAdV21a strains","Human adenoviruses","HAdV subtype","key genomic data","circulation of human adenovirus type","disease control","associated proteins","kDa hexon assembly","KpnI","good consistency","epidemiological investigations","BamHI","penton","polymorphisms","nucleotide identity","HAdV21b","members","potential pathogen","polymerase chain reaction","diversity of diseases","children","adults","throat swab","Restriction enzymes","Common features","E4 gene","Phylogenetic analysis","total","closed environments","countries","HAdVs","respiratory infections","Random downsampling","length"],"language":"en"},

These findings suggest that the H1381R mutation is responsible for enhanced fusion activity, which may be attributed to the efficient transfer of S onto the cell surface.

Overall, our study reveals the high topological robustness of the FRC network and the critical role of the network integrity for the activation of adaptive immune responses.","publish_time":"2016-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Novkovic, Mario; Onder, Lucas; Cupovic, Jovana; Abe, Jun; Bomze, David; Cremasco, Viviana; Scandella, Elke; Stein, Jens V.; Bocharov, Gennady; Turley, Shannon J.; Ludewig, Burkhard","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07ac15697a17a271224c7477de061f4ca6fc62aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4945005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27415420/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LN FRC","FRC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LN FRC network","activation of adaptive immune responses","network integrity","substantial impairment of immune cell recruitment","LNs","FRCs","T cells","complete FRC ablation","intranodal T cell migration","control immune regulatory processes","high topological robustness","dendritic cell-mediated activation of antiviral CD8","topological properties","Fibroblastic reticular cells","key molecules","graph theory-based systems biology approach","distinct microenvironmental niches","cellular scaffold of lymph nodes","critical role","imprinted small-world topology","validation","silico perturbation analysis","wk","study","mice","loss"],"language":"en"},

Eighteen 3-week old colostrum-fed Jersey calves were completely randomized to 1 of 6 doses of E. coli O111:H8. The challenge doses included 0, 1.5\u00D7105, 1.5\u00D7106, 1.5\u00D7107, 1.5\u00D7108, and 1.5\u00D7109 colony-forming units (CFU) given intravenously as a bolus in 5mL of sterile isotonic saline. Peripheral blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48h relative to the challenge for biochemical, total leukocyte count, and differential analyses. Rectal temperatures were collected via indwelling rectal temperature probes at 5-min intervals, and hourly averages calculated from 2 d prior to the challenge till 2 d after the challenge. All calves survived the 48h observation period following the challenge. Calves given 1.5\u00D7108 and 1.5\u00D7109 CFU displayed sickness behaviors (P \u003C0.01) beginning 0.5h after the challenge and returned to that of the control calves by 6 and 32h for calves challenged with 1.5\u00D7108 and 1.5\u00D7109 CFU, respectively. There were treatment\u00D7time interactions (P \u003C0.01) on total leukocyte counts and plasma glucose and zinc concentrations. Calves administered 1.5\u00D7108 and 1.5\u00D7109 CFU had leucopenia beginning 2h after the challenge and returning to counts similar to the control calves within 24h. Additionally, those calves were hypoglycemic from 4 to 12h after the challenge with the degree of hypoglycemia inversely related to the dose of the E. coli. All calves challenged with E. coli had decreased plasma zinc concentrations, and the magnitude was inversely proportional to the challenge dose. There were treatment\u00D7time interactions (P \u003C0.001) on rectal temperatures following the challenge. All calves challenged with E. coli developed a febrile response, but the intensity and duration of the response were dependent on the challenge dose. These data indicate that calves intravenously challenged with 1.5\u00D7108 and 1.5\u00D7109 CFU of the E. coli O111:H8 showed immediate clinical and biochemical signs indicative of septicemia. However, calves administered 1.5\u00D7107 or less of the E. coli had febrile responses, but did not develop septicemia. Blood glucose and zinc concentrations may be dose responsive indicators that could potentially differentiate between a septicemic versus non-septicemic calf.","publish_time":"2011-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ballou, M.

Innate immune responses respond immediately from the day of HIV infection, and a thorough understanding of the interaction between several innate immune cells and HIV-1 is essential to determine to what extent those cells play a crucial role in controlling HIV-1 in vivo. Defensins, divided into the three subfamilies \u03B1-, \u03B2-, and \u03B8-defensins based on structure and disulfide linkages, comprise a critical component of the innate immune response and exhibit anti-HIV-1 activities and immunomodulatory capabilities.

In response to the epidemic, a new crisis management program was implemented and tested in Taipei. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Having noticed that transmission surged on weekends during the Keelung epidemic, Taipei City launched a multi-channel mass risk communications program that included short message service (SMS) messages sent directly to approximately 2.2 million Taipei residents on Friday, October 12th, 2007. The public was told to keep symptomatic students from schools and was provided guidelines for preventing the spread of the disease at home. Epidemiological characteristics of Taipei\u0027s outbreak were analyzed from 461 sampled AHC cases. Median time from exposure to onset of the disease was 1 day. This was significantly shorter for cases occurring in family clusters than in class clusters (mean\u00B1SD: 2.6\u00B13.2 vs. 4.39\u00B14.82 days, p = 0.03), as well as for cases occurring in larger family clusters as opposed to smaller ones (1.2\u00B11.7 days vs. 3.9\u00B14.0 days, p\u003C0.01). Taipei\u0027s program had a significant impact on patient compliance. Home confinement of symptomatic children increased from 10% to 60% (p\u003C0.05) and helped curb the spread of AHC. Taipei experienced a rapid decrease in AHC cases between the Friday of the SMS announcement and the following Monday, October 15, (0.70% vs. 0.36%). By October 26, AHC cases reduced to 0.01%. The success of this risk communication program in Taipei (as compared to Keelung) is further reflected through rapid improvements in three epidemic indicators: (1) significantly lower crude attack rates (1.95% vs. 14.92%, p\u003C0.001), (2) a short epidemic period of AHC (13 vs. 34 days), and (3) a quick drop in risk level (1\u223C2 weeks) in Taipei districts that border Keelung (the original domestic epicenter). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The timely launch of this systematic, communication-based intervention proved effective at preventing a dangerous spike in AHC and was able to bring this high-risk disease under control. We recommend that public health officials incorporate similar methods into existing guidelines for preventing pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2009-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yen, Muh-Yong; Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Chiu, Allen Wen-Hsiang; Wong, Wing-Wai; Wang, Po-En; Chan, Ta-Chien; King, Chwan-Chuen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6efde6b65a96f7b14d75d637f5dd77f8e6e1c51c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2776508.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19956722/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHC"],"locations":["Keelung City","Taipei City"],"keyphrases":["Taipei City","spread of AHC","sampled AHC cases","Keelung epidemic","Taipei districts","Taipei residents","days","Keelung City","short epidemic period of AHC","risk communication program","Taipei\u0027s program","border Keelung","epidemic indicators","class clusters","risk level","larger family clusters","high-risk disease","multi-channel mass risk communications program","new crisis management program","existing guidelines","rapid decrease","Epidemiological characteristics of Taipei\u0027s outbreak","rapid improvements","symptomatic students","SMS announcement","Home confinement of symptomatic children","short message service","communication-based intervention","public health officials","outbreak of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis","pandemic influenza","similar methods","timely launch","onset","significant impact","weeks","dangerous spike","smaller ones","original domestic epicenter","emerging infectious diseases","exposure","transmission","messages","mean","weekends","patient compliance","lower crude attack rates","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Median time","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","quick drop","SD","schools","success","METHODOLOGY","control","response","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Semiconducting nanomaterials are attractive because their physical properties are different from those of the bulk due to the quantum-size effect. Also, they provide opportunities to study the effect of spatial confinement and problems related to surfaces or interfaces, which is important for chemistry. Recently, one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials, such as nanowires, nanobelts, nanorods, and nanotubes, have become the focus of intensive research owing to their potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, electrochemical, electromechanical, and other fields. Further, various outstanding properties of NsM, such as optical absorbance, improved magnetism, and specific surface area, for efficient device fabrication have been summarized.

The benzo[b]furan derivative MU314 inhibits in vitro bone resorption as potently as \u03B2-estradiol (E2). Here, we examined the point of action on the anti-osteoporotic effects of MU314. MU314 (10 nM) suppressed lacunae formation by osteoclastic cells and ICI-182,780, a pure E2 antagonist, inhibited this effect. Specifically, we ovariectomized (OVX) Wistar female rats and subcutaneously injected them with either MU314 (30 or 100 \u03BCg/kg) or E2 (100 \u03BCg/kg) over an 8-week period. Bone mineral content (BMC) in the proximal end of the tibia was significantly decreased (14%) in OVX rats, and MU314 (100 \u03BCg/kg) and E2 significantly suppressed the decline in BMC. OVX rats exhibited decreased cancellous bone in the proximal end of the tibia and induced destruction of its trabecular structure. MU314 suppressed these changes. OVX also reduced the mechanical strength of the femoral neck, which was also recovered by MU314 and E2. E2 completely protected against OVX-induced uterine atrophy, but MU314 had no effect. These results strongly indicate that MU314 acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukuyama, Ryo; Shimokawa, Akio; Kodama, Yasushi; Fujita, Mitsugu; Ohishi, Yoshitaka; Ando, Yuko; Koida, Masao; Nakamuta, Hiromichi","journal":"Journal of Pharmacological Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/602e1d7bdb8d5504c5fe21d39ab5f915cfc6287f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1347861319307078; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1347861319307078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMC","OVX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MU314 acts","OVX rats","furan derivative MU314","anti-osteoporotic effects of MU314","\u03BCg","pure E2 antagonist","bone resorption","proximal end","decreased cancellous bone","tibia","BMC","Bone mineral content","Wistar female rats","induced destruction","ICI","lacunae formation","selective estrogen receptor modulator","osteoclastic cells","mechanical strength","nM","benzo","point of action","trabecular structure","\u03B2-estradiol","uterine atrophy","femoral neck","results","decline","week period","changes"],"language":"en"},

There is therefore an urgent need for the development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of dengue. Peptide was once a neglected choice of medical treatment but it has lately regained interest from the pharmaceutical industry following pioneering advancements in technology. In this review, the design of peptide drugs, antiviral activities and mechanisms of peptides and peptidomimetics (modified peptides) action against dengue virus are discussed. The development of peptides as inhibitors for viral entry, replication and translation is also described, with a focus on the three main targets, namely, the host cell receptors, viral structural proteins and viral non-structural proteins. The antiviral peptides designed based on these approaches may lead to the discovery of novel anti-DENV therapeutics that can treat dengue patients.","publish_time":"2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chew, Miaw-Fang; Poh, Keat-Seong; Poh, Chit-Laa","journal":"Int J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dca3423350c6278fe7b9479eb894a578ffeeeb68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5707751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200948/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.21875","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of dengue","antiviral peptides","dengue patients","dengue virus serotypes","development of peptides","mechanisms of peptides","modified peptides","development of antiviral drugs","viral structural proteins","viral non-structural proteins","viral entry","antiviral activities","design of peptide drugs","neglected choice of medical treatment","discovery of novel anti-DENV therapeutics","host cell receptors","peptidomimetics","long-term efficacy","important global threat","pharmaceutical industry","commercial vaccine","inhibitors","action","TDV","pioneering advancements","technology","replication","main targets","urgent need","availability of CYD","translation","review","approaches","focus","infections"],"language":"en"},

Since then, infections have been detected in \u003E1500 individuals, with disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to severe, fatal pneumonia. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this virus and investigate mechanisms underlying disease severity variation in the absence of autopsy data, a rhesus macaque and common marmoset model of MERS-CoV disease were analyzed. Rhesus macaques developed mild disease, and common marmosets exhibited moderate to severe, potentially lethal, disease. Both nonhuman primate species exhibited respiratory clinical signs after inoculation, which were more severe and of longer duration in the marmosets, and developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia. In marmosets, the pneumonia was more extensive, with development of severe airway lesions. Quantitative analysis showed significantly higher levels of pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and higher amounts of pulmonary viral antigen in marmosets. Pulmonary expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, was similar in marmosets and macaques. These results suggest that increased virus replication and the local immune response to MERS-CoV infection likely play a role in pulmonary pathology severity. Together, the rhesus macaque and common marmoset models of MERS-CoV span the wide range of disease severity reported in MERS-CoV\u2013infected humans, which will aid in investigating MERS-CoV disease pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baseler, Laura J.; Falzarano, Darryl; Scott, Dana P.; Rosenke, Rebecca; Thomas, Tina; Munster, Vincent J.; Feldmann, Heinz; de Wit, Emmie","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89d144081894a40f61f156c794e0ec60b3d2e876.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c3ac28783beb36d4b01a82b6c3196407f6097b7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4816712.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944015006495; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944015006495; http://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002944015006495/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26724387/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.10.025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV disease pathogenesis","MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV receptor","severe pneumonia","common marmosets","disease severity variation","mild disease","common marmoset model of MERS","common marmoset models of MERS","wide range of disease severity","pulmonary pathology severity","Pulmonary expression","Rhesus macaques","fatal pneumonia","developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia","development of severe airway lesions","higher levels of pulmonary neutrophil infiltration","higher amounts of pulmonary viral antigen","respiratory clinical signs","increased virus replication","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","local immune response","absence of autopsy data","nonhuman primate species","dipeptidyl peptidase","inoculation","role","mechanisms","Quantitative analysis","longer duration","results","infected humans","individuals","infections"],"language":"en"},

Objectives The purpose of this paper is to propose a PPE calculation system to help hospitals to decide their PPE stockpile. Methods We searched influenza guidelines from a number of countries and research papers on protective devices and infectious diseases. The PPE calculation system included factors such as the influenza pandemic period, risk classification by health care workers (HCW) type, and the type and number of PPE for a HCW per day. Results We concluded that 4 sets of PPE (N95 respirators, double gloves, gowns, and goggles) per day should be prepared for HCWs in a high-risk group. Similarly, 2 sets of appropriate PPE, depending on the risk level, are required for medium- and low-risk groups. In addition, 2 surgical masks are required for every worker and inpatient and 1 for each outpatient. The PPE stockpile should be prepared to cover at least an 8-week pandemic. Conclusion Purchasing a PPE stockpile requires a sizable budget. The PPE calculation system in this paper will hopefully support hospitals in deciding their PPE stockpile.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashikura, Mayuko; Kizu, Junko","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c7de742ccdab73cf04032fc703ad83aa65b685e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132647.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2009.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655309006579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748157/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655309006579","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPE stockpile","number of PPE","sets of PPE","PPE calculation system","sets of appropriate PPE","risk classification","type","influenza pandemic period","influenza guidelines","risk level","influenza pandemics","hospitals","day","low-risk groups","protective devices","number of countries","week pandemic","Background Personal protective equipment","health care workers","research papers","gowns","double gloves","N95 respirators","factors","infectious diseases","goggles","surgical masks","HCWs","crucial means","sizable budget","hospital settings","high-risk group","addition","Objectives","purpose","Methods","Conclusion","outpatient"],"language":"en"},

First isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in June 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as of 16 February 2015, 983 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV (360 deaths; 36.6% mortality) were reported to the WHO. Cases have been acquired in both the community and hospitals with limited human-to-human transmission reported in the community. Whilst the majority of MERS cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cases have been reported from Europe, USA and Asia in people who traveled from the Middle East or their contacts. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying co-morbidities. There is no specific drug treatment for MERS and infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. MERS-CoV continues to be an endemic,low level public health threat. However, the concern remains that the virus could mutate to exhibit increased interhuman transmissibility, increasing pandemic potential. Our seminar presents an overview of current knowledge and perspectives on the epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogen-host responses, clinical features, diagnosis and development of new drugs and vaccines.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zumla, Alimuddin; Hui, David S; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72076bc07694d7ba7e9fd2adfcb10b11fde1c9ba.json; document_parses/pdf_json/76b7e2b381c3a68161e8aea0975231845f031205.json; document_parses/pdf_json/551ee82e94704c76068921fa6ea9db4fa414993e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4721578.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60454-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26049252/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615604548; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673615604548; http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673615604548/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","United Arab Emirates","Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","cases of MERS","spread of MERS","majority of MERS cases","Clinical features of MERS range","human transmission","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","indirect transmission","lethal respiratory disease","exact mode of transmission","acute respiratory distress syndrome","severe respiratory illness","Saudi Arabia","community","mild disease","host species","limited human","pathogen-host responses","health care facilities","low level public health threat","infection prevention","positive sense RNA betacoronavirus","diagnosis","multi-organ failure","control measures","epidemiology","endemic","perspectives","development of new drugs","people","humans","virology","United Arab Emirates","increased interhuman transmissibility","overview of current knowledge","specific drug treatment","individuals","pandemic potential","Europe","Dromedary camels","Jeddah","underlying co-morbidities","USA","Asia","seminar","vaccines","patient","hospitals","deaths","contacts","laboratory","concern","mortality"],"language":"en"},

DI RNAs often retain the 5\u2032 end of the capsid protein (C) gene which has been shown to modulate virus-specific RNA synthesis. However, when replicons either with or without the C gene were passaged serially in the presence of wt RUB as a source of the virion proteins, it was found that neither replicon was maintained and DI RNAs were generated. The majority DI RNA species contained in-frame deletions in the SP-ORF leading to a fusion between the 5\u2032 end of the C gene and the 3\u2032 end of the E1 glycoprotein gene. DI infectious cDNA clones were constructed and transcripts from these DI infectious cDNA clones were maintained during serial passage with wt RUB.

The chemokine profile analysis indicated that SARS-CoV SUD significantly up-regulated the expression of CXCL10, CCL5 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2 in human lung epithelial cells and in the lung tissues of the mice intratracheally instilled with the recombinant plasmids. Among the SUD subdomains, SUD-MC substantially activated AP-1-mediated CXCL10 expression in vitro. In the wild type mice, SARS-CoV SUD-MC triggered the pulmonary infiltration of macrophages and monocytes, inducing CXCL10-mediated inflammatory responses and severe diffuse alveolar damage symptoms. Moreover, SUD-MC actuated NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-dependent pulmonary inflammation, as confirmed by the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor and the NLRP3-/- mouse model.

Recently, it has been shown that the C-type lectins DC-SIGN/L-SIGN can promote entry of several coronaviruses. Here we examine whether DC-SIGN/L-SIGN are entry determinants for IBV. We show that by introducing human DC-SIGN/L-SIGN into non-permissive cells, infection by the IBV is dramatically increased. DC-SIGN mediated infection was inhibited by mannan and anti-lectin antibodies, and was independent of sialic acid levels on the cell. Enhancement of IBV infection also occurred for different serotypes of IBV.

During the past 10 years, the proportion of LRTI in children and adults, associated with M. pneumoniae infection has ranged from 0 to more than 50%. This variation is due to the age and the geographic location of the population examined but also due to the diagnostic methods used.

Interestingly, it appears to be a disease that predominantly affects adults while the mortality in children is extremely low. However, the pathogenesis of SARS in relation to different characteristics relevant to age remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To better understand the role of cytokines in the immunopathological processes of SARS, weanling (4 weeks old), young (6 weeks old) and adult (10 weeks old) male BALB/C mice were inoculated intranasally with N-protein of SARS-CoV in this study. Serum or lung homogenate levels of some cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) and interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3) along with acute injury lung index and histology were also analyzed. RESULTS: Histopathological analysis of adult male BALB/C mice after N-protein infection showed progressive inflammatory reactions, especially pulmonary edema, in accordance with a moderately (~13%) elevated level of W/D ratio at 24 h. Although adult groups underwent a progressive lung inflammation in the acute phase accompanied by raised levels of TNF-\u03B1 in serum, no significant changes in lung TNF-\u03B1 level were reported simultaneously. Moreover, adult SARS infected BALB/c mice showed elevated levels of IFN-\u03B3 while IFN-\u03B3 levels in weanling and young groups had no obvious association with lung inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the observation that adult mice do have progressively greater immune reactions than weanling and adolescent ones over time. The relative immaturity of the immune system in weanlings may confer benefit leading to less impairment of lung function. However, the measurement of TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3 levels was not indicative of the severity of lung injury at the early stage of disease.","publish_time":"2009-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Y.

Robustness of this method is verified by numerical experiments with both artificial and stock returns series. Results show that the proposed W-MFSMXA method not only keep the multifractal structure unchanged, but contains more significant information of series compared to the previous MFSMXA method. Furthermore, analytic formulas of the binomial multifractal model are generated for W-MFSMXA. Theoretical analysis and finite-size effect test demonstrate that W-MFSMXA slightly outperforms MFSMXA for relatively shorter series. We further generate the scaling exponent ratio to describe the relation of two methods, whose profile is found approximating a centrosymmetric hyperbola. Cross-multifractality is found in returns series but then destroyed after being shuffled as a consequence of the removed long memory in separate series.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Hui; Shang, Pengjian","journal":"Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c8c67468726ad53a932253e3ab70df5241e562a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128505.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570415002373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288420/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007570415002373; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2015.06.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weighted MFSMXA method","previous MFSMXA method","proposed W-MFSMXA method","separate series","time series","shorter series","cross-multifractality","stock returns series","significant information of series","cross-correlations","modification of multifractal cross-correlation analysis","binomial multifractal model","multifractal structure unchanged","Theoretical analysis","finite-size effect test","Shannon entropy","statistical moments","removed long memory","numerical experiments","profile","analytic formulas","scaling exponent ratio","consequence","centrosymmetric hyperbola","paper","methods","Results","Abstract","Robustness"],"language":"en"},

Since the re-emergence of the virulent genotype 2b (G2b) in 2014, Jeju Island in South Korea has faced periodic outbreaks, leading to the occurrence of endemics in provincial herds. In this study, we examined the complete genome sequences and molecular characteristics of novel G2b PEDV variants with a two-amino-acid deletion in the neutralizing epitope of the spike (S) gene, which were concurrently identified on a re-infected farm and its neighboring farm on Jeju Island. Whole-genome sequencing of the Jeju S-DEL isolates KNU-1829 and KNU-1830 revealed the presence of a continuous 9-nucleotide deletion within the nonstructural protein coding region. Their genomes were 28,023 nucleotides in length, 15 nucleotides shorter than those of the classical G2b PEDV strains. The two S-DEL isolates had 96.4\u201399.2% and 98.3\u201399.7% identity at the S-gene and full-genome level, respectively, to other global G2b PEDV strains. Genetic and antigenic analyses indicated that the S-DEL isolates are most closely related to the primary strain identified from the initial exposure at the same farm, but the virus appears to undergo continuous evolution, possibly leading to antigenic drift under recurrent or endemic pressure. This study provides important information about the antigenic diversity of PEDV circulating in the endemic areas, which arises from continuous non-lethal mutations to ensure viral fitness in the host environment.

In this paper, we first time found that PRRSV could phosphorylate IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and weakly activate the IFN-\u03B2 promoter in MARC-145 cells in early infection, but the activations of IRF-3 and IFN-\u03B2 promoter were rapidly inhibited in the following infection. Furthermore, which components or products of the invading PRRSV cause PRRSV to inhibit IFN-\u03B2 promoter activity attracted our attentions. The obtained results showed that PRRSV nsp1 could inhibit Poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03B2 promoter activity in MARC-145 cells by down-regulating the protein level of IRF-3 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF-3.

Further challenges in improving management outcomes for respiratory tract infections exist: rapid identification of drug resistant pathogens; more widespread surveillance of infections, locally and internationally; and global responses to infections with pandemic potential. Developments in genome amplification have led to the discovery of several new respiratory pathogens, and sensitive PCR methods for the diagnostic work-up of these are available. Advances in technology have allowed for development of single and multiplexed PCR techniques that provide rapid detection of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens.

The choice of which anticonvulsant to administer for maintenance therapy is tailored to each individual patient.","publish_time":"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavely, James A.","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16cfac4c260d7c825ccb1685e639c546f9d9a9cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24580991/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvsm.2013.10.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561613002106; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195561613002106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["young animals","Infectious diseases","adult animals","inflammatory brain diseases","middle-aged small-breed dogs","necrotizing encephalitis","different considerations","puppies","nervous system","therapeutic decisions","granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis","Seizure disorders","maintenance therapy","years of age","anticonvulsant","diagnosis of canine distemper","kittens","clinical signs","individual patient","adults","Idiopathic epilepsy"],"language":"en"},

Seasonal synchrony of other infectious diseases is less known. We describe the seasonality and seasonal synchrony of three common childhood infectious diagnoses among three regions in Taiwan. Methods A large, nationally representative sample of young children (N =128 651, age 0\u20134 years) was used to estimate the monthly incidences of acute respiratory infection, acute intestinal infection, and herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in three regions of Taiwan between 2000 and 2005.

The health implications of this development are uncertain. Intensification creates cheaper products, allowing more people to access animal-based foods. However, some practices associated with intensification may contribute to zoonotic disease emergence and spread: for example, the sustained use of antibiotics, concentration of animals in confined units, and long distances and frequent movement of livestock. Objectives: Here we present the diverse range of ecological, biological, and socioeconomic factors likely to enhance or reduce zoonotic risk, and identify ways in which a comprehensive risk analysis may be conducted by using an interdisciplinary approach. We also offer a conceptual framework to guide systematic research on this problem. Discussion: We recommend that interdisciplinary work on zoonotic risk should take into account the complexity of risk environments, rather than limiting studies to simple linear causal relations between risk drivers and disease emergence and/or spread. In addition, interdisciplinary integration is needed at different levels of analysis, from the study of risk environments to the identification of policy options for risk management. Conclusion: Given rapid changes in livestock production systems and their potential health implications at the local and global level, the problem we analyze here is of great importance for environmental health and development. Although we offer a systematic interdisciplinary approach to understand and address these implications, we recognize that further research is needed to clarify methodological and practical questions arising from the integration of the natural and social sciences.","publish_time":"2013-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liverani, Marco; Waage, Jeff; Barnett, Tony; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Rushton, Jonathan; Rudge, James W.; Loevinsohn, Michael E.; Scoones, Ian; Smith, Richard D.; Cooper, Ben S.; White, Lisa J.; Goh, Shan; Horby, Peter; Wren, Brendan; Gundogdu, Ozan; Woods, Abigail; Coker, Richard J.","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5314aaa04b14fdbb926bc8eeb0826eedee66dadc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3734490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23665854/; https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1206001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zoonotic risk","risk drivers","risk management","study of risk environments","complexity of risk environments","comprehensive risk analysis","interdisciplinary integration","systematic interdisciplinary approach","interdisciplinary work","potential health implications","zoonotic disease emergence","livestock production systems","environmental health","development","process of rapid intensification","problem","systematic research","frequent movement of livestock","rapid changes","different levels of analysis","simple linear causal relations","long distances","concentration of animals","confined units","studies","identification of policy options","people","sustained use of antibiotics","example","ways","account","great importance","global level","diverse range of ecological","parts","socioeconomic factors","animal-based foods","practical questions","social sciences","cheaper products","conceptual framework","Conclusion","world","Discussion","addition","Objectives","Background","practices"],"language":"en"},

Improved understanding of the role of respiratory pathogens in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is required and the use of molecular microbiological techniques may lead to insights into host\u2013pathogen interactions and the development of more targeted therapeutic approaches. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Acute Exacerbation and Respiratory InfectionS in COPD (AERIS) is a longitudinal epidemiological study to assess how changes in the COPD airway microbiome contribute to the incidence and severity of AECOPD. Patients with COPD aged 40\u201385 are followed monthly for 2 years, and reviewed within 72 h of onset of symptoms of AECOPD. Exacerbations are detected using daily electronic diary cards. Blood, sputum, nasopharyngeal and urine samples are collected at prespecified timepoints. Molecular diagnostic and typing techniques are used to describe the dynamics of airway infection during AECOPD and stable disease, and associations with clinical outcome. This study aims to refine the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology. AERIS will assess the impact of AECOPD on health-related quality of life and healthcare resource utilisation, and the possible interactions between nutritional status, infection and immune responses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: AERIS is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, and has been approved by the institutional ethics and review board. All participants must provide written informed consent. The results obtained will be disseminated at international medical conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. DISCUSSION: Few other studies have addressed the complexity of the microbiological and systemic components of COPD or employed real-time electronic tracking of symptoms to identify AECOPD and potential aetiological triggers. RESULTS: Results of AERIS will increase our understanding of the contribution of pathogens to AECOPD, potentially leading to new targeted therapeutic and preventative interventions.

Using data from a prospective cohort of children with influenza-like illness, we examined the virology of ARTI and determined the clinical impact of virus-virus codetection. METHODS: Children aged 6 to 59 months who presented to a tertiary pediatric hospital between influenza seasons 2008 and 2012 with fever and acute respiratory symptoms were enrolled, and nasal samples were collected. Respiratory viruses were identified by culture and polymerase chain reaction. We compared demographics, presenting symptoms, and clinical outcomes of children with a single-virus infection and those in whom 2 or more viruses were detected (virus-virus codetection). We used logistic regression models and estimated marginal means to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and probabilities of symptom presentation, prescription of antibiotics, and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 2356 children, a virus was detected in 1630 (69.2%) of them; rhinovirus (40.8%), influenza (29.5%), and respiratory syncytial virus (26.4%) were detected most commonly. Two or more viruses were detected in 25% of these children. After we adjusted for demographic factors, children with virus-virus codetection had greater odds of presenting with cough (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2\u20133.1) and rhinorrhea (aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1\u20132.9) than those with a single-virus infection, although both symptoms were common. Children with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus combined had the highest probability of hospitalization (55%; 95% CI, 35%\u201373%), which was significantly greater than for those with influenza infection alone (22%; 95% CI, 16%\u201329%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, virus-virus codetection has limited impact on clinical severity among children with influenza-like illness. However, infection with specific pathogen pairs might be associated with more severe outcomes. Routine diagnostics to identify specific viruses should be restricted to common pathogens.","publish_time":"2016-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Faye J; Wake, Zoe V; Levy, Avram; Tempone, Simone; Moore, Hannah C; Richmond, Peter C; de Klerk, Nicholas; Conway, Nicholas T; Keil, Anthony D; Effler, Paul V; Smith, David W; Blyth, Christopher C","journal":"J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6488865ab8729b374794e7a9b0bfe575e040766.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107488.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piw042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440506/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-virus codetection","respiratory syncytial virus","single-virus infection","clinical impact of virus","influenza infection","clinical outcomes of children","Respiratory viruses","prospective cohort of children","influenza seasons","acute respiratory symptoms","acute respiratory tract infection","specific viruses","clinical significance of ARTI","clinical severity","adjusted odds ratios","greater odds of presenting","virology of ARTI","aOR","illness","severe outcomes","common pathogens","specific pathogen pairs","highest probability of hospitalization","cough","marginal means","probabilities of symptom presentation","fever","culture","tertiary pediatric hospital","prescription of antibiotics","logistic regression models","BACKGROUND","nasal samples","polymerase chain reaction","demographic factors","data","months","Routine diagnostics","confidence interval","demographics","CONCLUSIONS","rhinorrhea","rhinovirus","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]-FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a longitudinal noninvasive approach can be beneficial in providing biomarkers for host immune response. [(18)F]-FDG uptake is increased in activated immune cells in response to virus entry and can be localized by PET imaging. We used [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT to investigate the host response developing in nonhuman primates after MERS-CoV exposure and applied kinetic modeling to monitor the influx rate constant (K(i)) in responsive lymphoid tissue. METHODS: Multiple [(18)F]-FDG-PET and CT images were acquired on a PET/CT clinical scanner modified to operate in a biosafety level 4 environment prior to and up to 29 days after MERS-CoV aerosol exposure. Time activity curves of various lymphoid tissues were reconstructed to follow the [(18)F]-FDG uptake for approximately 60 min (3,600 s). Image-derived input function was used to calculate K(i) for lymphoid tissues by Patlak plot. RESULTS: Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed alterations in K(i) that was associated with the time point (p \u003C 0.001) after virus exposure and the location of lymphoid tissue (p = 0.0004). As revealed by a statistically significant interaction (p \u003C 0.0001) between these two factors, the pattern of K(i) changes over time differed between three locations but not between subjects. A distinguished pattern of statistically significant elevation in K(i) was observed in mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) that correlated to K(i) changes in axillary LNs. Changes in LNs K(i) were concurrent with elevations of monocytes in peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]-FDG-PET is able to detect subtle changes in host immune response to contain a subclinical virus infection. Full quantitative analysis is the preferred approach rather than semiquantitative analysis using standardized uptake value for detection of the immune response to the virus.

However, the genotype diversity and epidemiological information relating to HAdVs among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is limited. Here, we describe the epidemiology and genotype distribution of HAdVs associated with RTIs in Beijing, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with RTIs from April 2017 to March 2018. HAdVs were detected by a TaqMan-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, and the hexon gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. Epidemiological data were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. RESULTS: HAdV was detected in 72 (5.64%) of the 1276 NPA specimens, with most (86.11%, 62/72) HAdV-positives cases detected among children \u003C 6 years of age. HAdV-B3 (56.06%, 37/66) and HAdV-C2 (19.70%, 13/66) were the most frequent. Of the 72 HAdV-infected cases, 27 (37.50%) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly parainfluenza virus (12.50%, 9/72) and rhinovirus (9.72%, 7/72). The log number of viral load ranged from 3.30 to 9.14 copies per mL of NPA, with no significant difference between the HAdV mono- and co-infection groups. The main clinical symptoms in the HAdV-infected patients were fever and cough, and 62 (86.11%, 62/72) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Additionally, HAdVs were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in summer. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV prevalence is related to age and season. HAdV-B and HAdV-C circulated simultaneously among the hospitalized children with RTIs in Beijing, and HAdV-B type 3 and HAdV-C type 2 were the most frequent.","publish_time":"2019-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Li-hong; Wang, Chao; Wei, Tian-li; Wang, Hao; Ma, Fen-lian; Zheng, Li-shu","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0e0a545d003e79b46773517d09ac3e7af93ba3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6567909.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31196108/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1185-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["HAdV prevalence","HAdV mono","HAdV-B3","HAdV-C2","HAdV-infected cases","HAdV-C type","HAdV-B type","HAdV-infected patients","HAdV-positives cases","RTIs","hospitalized children","genotype distribution of HAdVs","Beijing","NPA specimens","respiratory viruses","epidemiological information","Epidemiological data","genotype diversity","higher prevalence","years of age","respiratory tract infections","co-infection groups","qPCR","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","assay","statistical product","service solutions","SPSS","TaqMan","hexon gene","main clinical symptoms","fever","significant difference","Human adenoviruses","log number of viral load","phylogenetic analysis","software","summer","parainfluenza virus","wide range of diseases","METHODS","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","cough","BACKGROUND","epidemiology","copies","season","China","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","rhinovirus","pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV\u2013host interactome and drug targets in the human protein\u2013protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV\u2013host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the \u201CComplementary Exposure\u201D pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV\u2013host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin; Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong","journal":"Cell Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/418538e40e195b8a0c7669b3a005ebcdb6a325c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7073332.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32194980/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-0153-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","nCoV","potential drug combinations","human interactome network","enrichment analyses of drug","network proximity analyses of drug targets","novo drug discovery","human protein","effective drugs","effective drug discovery strategy","potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs","antiviral drug repurposing methodology","existing drugs","host interactome","Human coronaviruses","protein interaction network","human cell lines","HCoV-induced transcriptomics data","powerful network-based methodologies","rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs","host interactions","melatonin","host subnetwork","sirolimus","Phylogenetic analyses","mercaptopurine","study","systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform","novel coronavirus","sequence identities","highest nucleotide sequence identity","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","gene signatures","separate neighborhoods","interplay","HCoVs","global epidemics","high morbidity","mortality","cost","pattern","dactinomycin","genomes","Complementary Exposure","conserved regions","nucleocapsid proteins","emodin","toremifene","time","summary","envelope"],"language":"en"},

Although the potential impact of COVID19 has been modelled extensively, very few numbers have been presented in the discussions about potential economic impacts. For a good answer to the question - will the restrictions cause as much harm as COVID19? - credible evidence-based estimates are required, rather than simply rhetoric. Here we provide some preliminary estimates to compare the impact of the current restrictions against the direct impact of the virus. Since most countries are currently taking an approach that reduces the number of COVID19 deaths, the estimates we provide for deaths from COVID19 are deliberately taken from the low end of the estimates of the infection fatality rate, while estimates for deaths from an economic recession are deliberately computed from double the high end of confidence interval for severe economic recessions. This ensures that an adequate challenge to the status quo of the current restrictions is provided. Our analysis shows that strict restrictions to eradicate the virus are likely to lead to at least eight times fewer total deaths than an immediate return to work scenario.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bailey, Neil W; West, Daniel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b910ad436128b904b63148792e76e0f5683554b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03491v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current COVID19 restrictions","current restrictions","potential impact of COVID19","number of COVID19 deaths","restrictions cause","strict restrictions","preliminary estimates","direct impact","potential economic impacts","severe economic recessions","credible evidence-based estimates","virus","times fewer total deaths","low end","high end of confidence interval","immediate return","question","discussions","infection fatality rate","considerable public debate","work scenario","approach","harm","costs","good answer","analysis","adequate challenge","countries","numbers","rhetoric"],"language":"en"},

The IHME models have received extensive attention in social and mass media, and have influenced policy makers at the highest levels of the United States government. For effective policy making the accurate assessment of uncertainty, as well as accurate point predictions, are necessary because the risks inherent in a decision must be taken into account, especially in the present setting of a novel disease affecting millions of lives. To assess the accuracy of the IHME models, we examine both forecast accuracy as well as the predictive performance of the 95% prediction intervals provided by the IHME models. We find that the initial IHME model underestimates the uncertainty surrounding the number of daily deaths substantially. Specifically, the true number of next day deaths fell outside the IHME prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time, in comparison to the expected value of 5%. In addition, we note that the performance of the initial model does not improve with shorter forecast horizons. Regarding the updated models, our analyses indicate that the later models do not show any improvement in the accuracy of the point estimate predictions. In fact, there is some evidence that this accuracy has actually decreased over the initial models. Moreover, when considering the updated models, while we observe a larger percentage of states having actual values lying inside the 95% prediction intervals (PI), our analysis suggests that this observation may be attributed to the widening of the PIs. The width of these intervals calls into question the usefulness of the predictions to drive policy making and resource allocation.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marchant, Roman; Samia, Noelle I.; Rosen, Ori; Tanner, Martin A.; Cripps, Sally","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dd6fd8bb608ec3e9d6835578f0d16fe320b605d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04734v4.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHME"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["IHME models","initial models","updated models","IHME prediction intervals","initial IHME model","later models","forecast accuracy","predictive performance","accurate point predictions","number of daily deaths","day deaths","policy makers","effective policy","point estimate predictions","United States government","accurate assessment of uncertainty","larger percentage of states","formal evaluation","true number","shorter forecast horizons","highest levels","extensive attention","mass media","novel disease","Institute","present setting","actual values","Health Metrics","question","COVID19","usefulness","improvement","analyses","millions of lives","risks inherent","comparison","decision","account","various updates","analysis","expected value","resource allocation","widening","observation","time","paper","evidence","width","PIs","fact","addition"],"language":"en"},

We show that the choice of priors has a substantial impact on the ability of the model to confidently assign data to the correct class (true positive rates). Prior choice also affects significantly the ability of a BNN to identify out-of-distribution instances as unknown (false positive rates). When comparing our results against neural networks (NN) with Monte Carlo dropout we found that BNNs generally outperform NNs.

CovidCTNet increases the accuracy of CT imaging detection to 90% compared to radiologists (70%). The model is designed to work with heterogeneous and small sample sizes independent of the CT imaging hardware.

Our results show that, in this context, neglecting interference may lead to a downward bias when assessing policy effectiveness.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prete, Davide Del; Forastiere, Laura; Sciabolazza, Valerio Leone","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d581d62bc6b6836a1b3921e6bd33e61658698e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13459v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spillover effects","network interference","methodology","policy effectiveness","optimal level of policy interventions","non-experimental setting subject","causal inference","agricultural markets","continuous treatment","generalized propensity score-based estimator","downward bias","directed edges","context","paper","results"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets, deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hammoudi, Karim; Benhabiles, Halim; Melkemi, Mahmoud; Dornaika, Fadi; Arganda-Carreras, Ignacio; Collard, Dominique; Scherpereel, Arnaud","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03399v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["viral pneumonia cases","Chest X-ray test images of COVID","pneumonia infection cases","viral cases","detected pneumonia cases","query chest X-ray images","epidemic COVID","open sets of chest X-ray images","screening viral pneumonia","deep learning architectures","deep learning methods","radiography images","health problems","health professionals","disease causes pneumonia","possibilities of training deep learning models","efficiency of proposed health indicators","Coronavirus disease","synthetic health data","detection models","infected patients","context","confirmed patients","pulmonary infections","infectious disease","estimating infection status","simulated scenarios of patients","patient status","training datasets","coronavirus pandemic","hope","analysis strategies","paper","precision tools","Experimental results","symptoms similar","high probability","flu","performances","rest","world","China"],"language":"en"},

While the focus on developing smartphone-based contact tracing applications or apps has been on privacy concerns stemming from the use of such apps, an important question that has not received sufficient attention is: How reliable will such smartphone-based electronic contact tracing be? This is a technical question related to how two smartphones reliably register their mutual proximity. Here, we examine in detail the technical prerequisites required for effective smartphone-based contact tracing. The underlying mechanism that any contact tracing app relies on is called Neighbor Discovery (ND), which involves smartphones transmitting and scanning for Bluetooth signals to record their mutual presence whenever they are in close proximity. The hardware support and the software protocols used for ND in smartphones, however, were not designed for reliable contact tracing. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate how reliably can smartphones do contact tracing. Our results point towards the design of a wearable solution for contact tracing that can overcome the shortcomings of a smartphone-based solution to provide more reliable and accurate contact tracing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that quantifies, both, the suitability and also the drawbacks of smartphone-based contact tracing. Further, our results can be used to parameterize a ND protocol to maximize the reliability of any contact tracing app that uses it.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kindt, Philipp H.; Chakraborty, Trinad; Chakraborty, Samarjit","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b361c9edd70e52d3ef668682f0b874e313166d6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05625v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ND"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reliable contact tracing","electronic contact tracing","accurate contact tracing","effective smartphone-based contact tracing","developing smartphone-based contact tracing applications","smartphone-based solution","smartphones","drawbacks of smartphone","apps","technical question","ND protocol","mutual proximity","results","wearable solution","mutual presence","important question","technical prerequisites","close proximity","essential tool","shelter","easing lockdowns","curfews","software protocols","reliability","novel coronavirus","shortcomings","governments","SARS-CoV","response","use","Bluetooth signals","design","underlying mechanism","focus","privacy concerns","sufficient attention","Neighbor Discovery","place orders","world","hardware support","knowledge","crisis","suitability","best","study","paper"],"language":"en"},

To avoid a larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the effectiveness of efficient vaccination.

Some of them are based on the classical epidemiological approach that assumes an exponential growth, but a few studies report that a power-law scaling may provide a better fit to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the data in China (01/20/2020--02/24/2020), and indeed find that the growth closely follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. The exponents are $2.48(20)$, $2.21(6)$ and $4.26(12)$ for the number of confirmed infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively, indicating an underlying small-world network structure in the pandemic. While no obvious deviations from the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases, negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of infections, particularly that for the region outside Hubei. This suggests the beginning of the slowing-down of the virus spreading due to the huge containment effort. Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the growth kinetics of the infection number exhibits much similarity for Hubei province and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in log-log plot, we rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps as much as possible with the total infection number in China, from which an approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the pandemic around March 3, 2020, with the number of infections about $83,000$. Further, by analyzing the kinetics of the mortality in log-log scale, we obtains a rough estimate that near March 3, the death rate of COVID-19 would be about $4.7\\%\\thicksim 5.0\\%$ for Hubei province and $0.7\\%\\thicksim1.0\\%$ for the region outside Hubei.

Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly non-uniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform healthcare planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Loring J.; Huang, Peng; Yin, Fan; Luo, Xiaoshuang Iris; Almquist, Zack W.; Hipp, John R.; Butts, Carter T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0873b49a9de223b8e20ed3b19f054e80f81f2a9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09850v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["local scales","detailed diffusion models","disease diffusion","potential disparities","local pandemic timing","uniform local mixing","non-uniform diffusion behavior","severe local outbreaks","potential implications","aggregate behavior","large impacts","extremity of impacts","Standard epidemiological models","spatial network structure","presence of numerous areas","substantial disparities","classic SIR","larger scales","disease trajectories","S cities","scale of cities","neighboring areas","aggregate infection curve","simulations of unrestricted COVID","long lag time relative","spatial features of interpersonal networks","hospital demand","health care utilization","employ variants of compartment","severity","risk assessment","heterogeneity","simple catchment model","probability of interaction","community outcomes","healthcare planning","population distribution","considerable variation","compliance","mitigation measures","monotone decline","distance","epidemic","ground","deceased","distancing interventions","results","analysis of social exposure","individuals","pattern","effect","importance"],"language":"en"},

We also found a hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to countries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control effects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the model and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical spreading properties observed in empirical data. Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although strict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in the regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the spreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic mechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some practical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.","publish_time":"2009-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xiao-Pu; Wang, Bing-Hong; Zhou, Chang-Song; Zhou, Tao; Zhu, Jun-Fang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35328b1fe8aa727f8cf751bd17a9ff01918bb71e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.1390v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spreading dynamics","hierarchical spreading properties","outbreak of local cases","hierarchical spreading pattern","generic control effects","prediction of on-going spreading","Target control","impact of control effects","local growth","local prevention","strict control measures","suitable control strategies","countries","H1N1","regions","distributions of confirmed cases of influenza","bird cases of H5N1","work","Similar scaling properties","mentioned detailed information","generic mechanisms","public health","Zipf\u0027s law","Heaps\u0027 law","pandemic of influenza","deeper understanding","largest number of active interregional travelers","serious on-going global public crisis","human traveling patterns","SARS","larger population","biological activity of virus","structure of social contacts","GDP","decision makers","severe acute respiratory syndrome","fundamental importance","Methodology","practical guidelines","need","modeling","evaluation","heterogeneity","focus","spread of infectious diseases","different levels","analysis","Principal Findings","transregional transmission","empirical data","scientific researches","smaller ones","Significance","Conclusions","Recent studies","Background"],"language":"en"},

Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. With a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland.

The traditional approach of contact tracing is time consuming, manpower intensive, dangerous and prone to error due to fatigue or lack of skill. Due to this there is an emergence of mobile based applications for contact tracing. These applications primarily utilize a combination of GPS based absolute location and Bluetooth based relative location remitted from user\u0027s smartphone to infer various insights. These applications have eased the task of contact tracing; however, they also have severe implication on user\u0027s privacy, for example, mass surveillance, personal information leakage and additionally revealing the behavioral patterns of the user. This impact on user\u0027s privacy leads to trust deficit in these applications, and hence defeats their purpose. In this work we discuss the various scenarios which a contact tracing application should be able to handle. We highlight the privacy handling of some of the prominent contact tracing applications. Additionally, we describe the various threat actors who can disrupt its working, or misuse end user\u0027s data, or hamper its mass adoption. Finally, we present privacy guidelines for contact tracing applications from different stakeholder\u0027s perspective.

They all assumed that each user in the seed set we select is activated successfully and then spread the influence. However, in the real scenario, not all users in the seed set are willing to be an influencer. Based on that, we consider each user associated with a probability with which we can activate her as a seed, and we can attempt to activate her many times. In this paper, we study the adaptive influence maximization with multiple activations (Adaptive-IMMA) problem, where we select a node at each step, observe whether she accepts to be a seed, if yes, wait to observe the influence diffusion process; If no, we can attempt to activate her again with higher cost, or select other node as a seed. We model the multiple activations mathematically, and define it on the domain of integer lattice. We propose a new concept, adaptive DR-submodularity, and show our Adaptive-IMMA is the problem that maximizing an adaptive monotone and DR-submodular function under the knapsack constraint. Adaptive DR-submodular maximization problem is never covered by any existing studies. Thus, we summarize its properties and study its approximability comprehensively, which is a non-trival generalization of existing analysis about adaptive submodularity. Besides, to overcome the difficulty to estimate the influence spread, we combine adaptive greedy policy with sampling techniques without losing approximation ratio but reducing the time complexity.

Contact tracing is an essential tool to change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Manual contact tracing of Covid-19 cases has significant challenges that limit the ability of public health authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact tracing through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm. Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems, but more privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor. These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical and economic productivity indicators. However, such a strategy based on mobile apps and machine learning should proactively mitigate potential ethical and privacy risks, which could have substantial impacts on society (not only impacts on health but also impacts such as stigmatization and abuse of personal data).

A key challenge for preventing and controlling COVID-19 is how to quickly, widely, and effectively implement the test for the disease, because testing is the first step to break the chains of transmission. To assist the diagnosis of the disease, radiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage patients into different risk levels. Deep learning methods have taken a more active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images, as witnessed in many recent works. Most of these works first train a CNN on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much smaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains may lead to poor performance due to visual domain shift. Also, the small scale of the COVID-19 dataset on the target domain can make the training fall into the overfitting trap. To solve all these crucial problems and fully exploit the available large-scale chest x-ray image dataset, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting, through which we are motivated to reduce the domain shift and avoid overfitting when training on a very small dataset of COVID-19. In addressing this formulated problem, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA), which is able to align the data distributions across different domains in a general domain space and also in a common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models, as well as effectively separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Jieli; Jing, Baoyu; Wang, Zeya","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5db8ce783cc6960bfb2865a53f4202e63100139c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11003v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["small dataset of COVID","problem of COVID","separating COVID","target domain","chest x-ray image classification","global pandemic of COVID","available large-scale chest x-ray image dataset","existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset","chest x-ray images","visual domain shift","disease","general domain space","different domains","semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting","novel Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network","SODA","target data","small scale","recent works","leading classification performance","different risk levels","poor performance","training fall","data distributions","common pneumonia","overfitting trap","formulated problem","smaller scale","common subspace of source","recent state-of-the-art models","triage patients","screening process","CNN","direct transfer","datasets","infected millions of people","radiology imaging","active role","step","Deep learning methods","testing","diagnosis","experiments","crucial problems","chains of transmission","outbreak","key challenge"],"language":"en"},

First, we compare neural networks with random seeding with networks that are initialized via estimations from the best-established model (i.e. the Hidden Markov). We find latter to outperform in terms of the frequency of VaR breaches (i.e. the realized return falling short of the estimated VaR threshold). Second, we balance the incentive structure of the loss function of our networks by adding a second objective to the training instructions so that the neural networks optimize for accuracy while also aiming to stay in empirically realistic regime distributions (i.e. bull vs. bear market frequencies). In particular this design feature enables the balanced incentive recurrent neural network (RNN) to outperform the single incentive RNN as well as any other neural network or established approach by statistically and economically significant levels.

Now that the pandemic is already past its peak in many of the hardest hit countries, policy makers are trying to figure out the best policies for gradually easing the lockdown to resume economic and social activity while protecting public health. In this paper, we develop a model for predicting the effects of government policies on COVID-19 fatalities -- the developed model (1) is flexibly able to handle model miss-specification in a data-driven fashion, (2) is able to quantify the uncertainty in its forecasts, and (3) is able to capture the effect of interventions on these forecasts. Our model is Bayesian: we use a susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered states (SEIR) model as a prior belief on the pandemic curve, and then update the posterior belief based on observed data using a Gaussian process. We incorporate the effects of policies on the future course of the pandemic by calibrating the priors using global data from many countries.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Zhaozhi; Alaa, Ahmed M.; Schaar, Mihaela van der","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/386bd22b9fb6eca91be9d3ab0c4f222cbffff6f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08837v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed model","effects of policies","model miss-specification","effects of government policies","policy makers","observed data","global data","pandemic curve","best policies","forecasts","potential magnitude of COVID","data-driven fashion","prior belief","government officials","posterior belief","local peak","hardest hit countries","mathematical compartmental models","containment","social activity","order","lockdown","patient volume","SEIR","fatalities","epidemic","outbreak","future course","priors","resource planning decisions","public health","Gaussian process","states","effect of interventions","coronavirus disease","Bayesian","uncertainty","paper"],"language":"en"},

By increasing the amount of globally accessible real-time information, today\u0027s ubiquitous producers contribute to a world, where an individual consumes vanishingly smaller fractions of all produced content. In general, consumers preferentially select information that closely matches their individual views and values. The bias inherent in such selection is further magnified by today\u0027s information curation services that maximize user engagement (and thus service revenue) by filtering new content in accordance with observed consumer preferences. Consequently, individuals get exposed to increasingly narrower bands of the ideology spectrum. Societies get fragmented into increasingly ideologically isolated enclaves. These enclaves (or echo-chambers) then become vulnerable to misinformation spread, which in turn further magnifies polarization and bias. We call this dynamic the paradox of information access; a growing ideological fragmentation in the age of sharing. This article describes the technical, economic, and socio-cognitive contributors to this paradox, and explores research directions towards its mitigation.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdelzaher, Tarek; Ji, Heng; Li, Jinyang; Yang, Chaoqi; Dellaverson, John; Zhang, Lixia; Xu, Chao; Szymanski, Boleslaw K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5cb74472783c13ac8181ed6ede0e392d526d9bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01967v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YouTube"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["information producer","paradox of information access","online content","accessible real-time information","today\u0027s information curation services","new content","produced content","individual views","isolated enclaves","bias inherent","today\u0027s ubiquitous producers","Modern online media","user engagement","growing ideological fragmentation","Twitter","accordance","service revenue","observed consumer preferences","socio-cognitive contributors","narrower bands","world","smaller fractions","selection","age of sharing","echo-chambers","ideology spectrum","Instagram","research directions","global consumption","Societies","mitigation","misinformation","individuals","article","YouTube","values","consumers","polarization"],"language":"en"},

Starting in Aug 2013, goats in the Jiangsu and Anhui provinces of eastern China suffered severe respiratory diseases. In order to identify the causative agent, numerous related pathogens were tested with RT-PCR or PCR. A unique PIV3 strain was detected in most of the clinical nasal swabs or serum samples. The virus was isolated on MDBK cells and characterized by RT-PCR, nucleotide sequence analysis and hemagglutination test. The entire M and F gene coding regions, HN, 5\u2032-UTR-N and L gene fragments were amplified using pairs of degenerate primers. Nucleotide, amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses based on these genes indicated that the goat-derived PIV3 strain was distinct from previously reported BPIV3 genotypes and HPIV3 strains. The novel isolate, named JS2013, might be a potentially new member of the respirovirus genus. Goats were experimentally infected with JS2013 culture. The virus-inoculated goats displayed coughing and nasal discharges that were related to respiratory diseases. Viremia and virus shedding were detected during 4\u201310 days post-inoculation (dpi). Virus-specific HI antibodies became positive from 14dpi.

Although a number of studies have focussed on identifying risk factors in disease development, risk factors associated with death from CPV are largely unknown. In this study we analysed a total of 1451 CPV cases reported from an Australian surveillance system \u2013 using univariate and multivariate techniques \u2013 to determine significant risk factors associated with death and euthanasia. A crude case fatality rate of 42.3% was estimated \u2013 higher than has been reported previously. We found that 3.3% of CPV cases had a history of vaccination in the previous 12 months, despite having completed the primary puppy vaccination course. The majority (89.5%) of these cases occurred in dogs \u003C12 months of age, indicating failure of the primary vaccination course to provide protective immunity (most likely due to interference of the vaccine antigen with maternal antibodies but other reasons are discussed). Extending the age at which the final puppy vaccination is administered might be one of several strategies to consider. The final multivariate model showed that in non-litter CPV cases, risk of death was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer) and pedigree type (hounds and non-sporting dogs). Euthanasia in non-litter CPV cases was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer), state of residence (Northern Territory/South Australia/Tasmania combined), age (\u003Csix months) and vaccination status (unvaccinated and unknown).

Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the concentration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (I50) in the low micromolar range (I50 = 1.5\u201320 \u03BCM), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I50 of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I50 = 2.0 \u03BCM of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 \u03BCm) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 \u03BCM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 \u03BCM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 \u03BCM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 \u03BCM). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors.

Though its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recently identified as a receptor for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the cell. Here, we aimed to clarify the potential role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury and its underlying mechanism. As a receptor for coronavirus, ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells in a similar way as for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 correlates with its efficient spread among humans. On the other hand, ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) primarily by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1\u20137, which exerts a beneficial effect on coronavirus-induced acute lung injury. Human recombinant ACE2 has been considered as a potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2 by blocking virus entry and redressing the imbalance of RAAS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The level of ACE2 expression can be upregulated by treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin \u2161 type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). To date, no evidence shows that ACEIs or ARBs increase the susceptibility and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and hence, it is not advisable to discontinue such drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Meng-Yuan; Zheng, Bo; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jian-Ping","journal":"Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1255096b56821d6be4ad568b0563e6f8c85774bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095882X20300426?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095882X20300426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","entry of SARS","ACE2 correlates","potential role of ACE2","entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","renin-angiotensin","level of ACE2 expression","Human recombinant ACE2","high binding affinity of SARS","acute lung injury","Abstract Coronavirus disease","virus entry","receptor blocker","imbalance of RAAS","mortality of patients","cardiovascular disease","potential therapy","major threat","similar way","treatment","type","ACEIs","ARBs","susceptibility","drugs","ACE inhibitor","efficient spread","aldosterone system","underlying mechanism","cells","beneficial effect","evidence","humans","public health","enzyme","date","hand","infection","pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Sixty-seven program directors responded (response rate, 91.8%); 36 (53.7%) hospitals did not yet have a policy, and 7 (10.4%) hospitals\u0027 policies could not be shared. The 29 institutions providing policies were relatively evenly distributed among the 4 U.S. geographic regions (range, 5 to 9 policies per region). Among the 26 unique policies analyzed, 3 (11.3%) were produced by state health departments. The most frequently cited triage criteria were benefit (25 policies [96.2%]), need (14 [53.8%]), age (13 [50.0%]), conservation of resources (10 [38.5%]), and lottery (9 [34.6%]). Twenty-one (80.8%) policies use scoring systems, and 20 of these (95.2%) use a version of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Among the policies that specify the triage team\u0027s composition (23 [88.5%]), all require or recommend a physician member, 20 (87.0%) a nurse, 16 (69.6%) an ethicist, 8 (34.8%) a chaplain, and 8 (34.8%) a respiratory therapist. Thirteen (50.0% of all policies) require or recommend those making triage decisions not be involved in direct patient care, but only 2 (7.7%) require that their decisions be blinded to ethically irrelevant considerations. LIMITATION: The results may not be generalizable to institutions without academic bioethics programs. CONCLUSION: Over one half of respondents did not have ventilator triage policies. Policies have substantial heterogeneity, and many omit guidance on fair implementation.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matheny Antommaria, Armand H.; Gibb, Tyler S.; McGuire, Amy L.; Wolpe, Paul Root; Wynia, Matthew K.; Applewhite, Megan K.; Caplan, Arthur; Diekema, Douglas S.; Hester, D.

However, the precise and relative roles of the two proteins in BCV infectivity remain elusive. To unequivocally determine their roles in viral cytopathogenicity, we developed a system in which phenotypically chimeric viruses were generated by infecting a closely related mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells that stably express an individual BCV protein (S or HE). The chimeric viruses were then used to infect human rectal tumor (HRT)-18 cells that are permissive to BCV but are nonsusceptible to MHV. Using this approach, we found that the chimeric virus containing the BCV S protein on the virion surface entered and replicated in HRT-18 cells; this was specifically blocked by prior treatment of the virus with a neutralizing antibody specific to the BCV S protein, indicating that the BCV S protein is responsible for initiating chimeric virus infection. In contrast, chimeric viruses that contain biologically active and functional BCV HE protein on the surface failed to enter HRT-18 cells, indicating that the BCV HE protein alone is not sufficient for BCV infection. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the S protein but not the HE protein of BCV is necessary and sufficient for infection of the chimeric viruses in HRT-18 cells, suggesting that BCV likely uses the S protein as a primary vehicle to infect permissive cells.","publish_time":"2002-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popova, Rada; Zhang, Xuming","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac7c42409b0dabe383150e0a688a4b9b275f9d90.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682201913078; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682201913078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV","MHV","BCV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of BCV","BCV S protein","BCV infection","individual BCV protein","functional BCV","BCV infectivity","chimeric viruses","permissive cells","chimeric virus infection","host cells","HRT","MHV","related mouse hepatitis virus","virion surface","envelope proteins","relative roles","neutralizing antibody specific","O-acetylneuraminic acid","primary vehicle","esterase","system","human rectal tumor","receptor-determinant","viral cytopathogenicity","hemagglutinin","bovine coronavirus","prior treatment","spike","contrast","results","approach"],"language":"en"},

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd \u003C 1,000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beck, Bo Ram; Shin, Bonggun; Choi, Yoonjung; Park, Sungsoo; Kang, Keunsoo","journal":"Comput Struct Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dda279eb76f13d551fa81fe4eaa4526b6314b9c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118541.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037020300490; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020300490?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32280433/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","nM","treatment of SARS","viral proteins of SARS","ritonavir","replication complex components of SARS","effective treatment strategies","Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction","drug repurposing","inhibitory potency","MT-DTI model","Kd","lopinavir","lack of effective treatment options","pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model","list of antiviral drugs","Wuhan of China","available drugs","various strategies","antiviral agents","viral proteinases","HIV","best chemical compound","novel coronavirus","Kaletra","efavirenz","atazanavir","human immunodeficiency virus","remdesivir","darunavir","antiretroviral medication","result","infection","study","dolutegravir","incidence rate","prediction","addition"],"language":"en"}]}

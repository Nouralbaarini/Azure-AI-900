However, studies on the infection status of medical personnels is still lacking. METHODS 54 cases of SARS-Cov-2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between January 7th to February 11th of 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method. RESULTS From January 7 to February 11, 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%). Among the 54 COVID-19 patients, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non-severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs. 38 years, p=0.0015). However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups. Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS-Cov-2 infected lungs with severe-/critical-type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs. 0%, P=0.028) and right lung (61% vs. 18.2%, P=0.012).

Early and quick identification of the potential risk zones of COVID-19 infection is increasingly vital for the megacities implementing targeted infection prevention and control measures. In this study, the communities with confirmed cases during January 21-February 27 were collected and considered as the specific epidemic data for Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We evaluated the spatiotemporal variations of the epidemics before utilizing the ecological niche models (ENM) to assemble the epidemic data and nine socioeconomic variables for identifying the potential risk zones of this infection in these megacities. Three megacities were differentiated by the spatial patterns and quantities of infected communities, average cases per community, the percentages of imported cases, as well as the potential risks, although their COVID-19 infection situations have been preliminarily contained to date. With higher risks that were predominated by various influencing factors in each megacity, the potential risk zones coverd about 75% to 100% of currently infected communities. Our results demonstrate that the ENM method was capable of being employed as an early forecasting tool for identifying the potential COVID-19 infection risk zones on a fine scale. We suggest that local hygienic authorities should keep their eyes on the epidemic in each megacity for sufficiently implementing and adjusting their interventions in the zones with more residents or probably crowded places. This study would provide useful clues for relevant hygienic departments making quick responses to increasingly severe epidemics in similar megacities in the world.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Hongyan; Zhao, Lu; Zhang, An; Song, Liuyi; Liao, Yilan; Lu, Weili; Cui, Cheng","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["infection risk zones","potential risk zones of COVID","potential COVID","potential risk zones coverd","potential risks","infection situations","similar megacities","targeted infection prevention","average cases","megacity","quantities of infected communities","confirmed cases","specific epidemic data","study","percentages of imported cases","quick responses","severe epidemics","quick identification","ENM method","higher risks","relevant hygienic departments","local hygienic authorities","early forecasting tool","community","useful clues","socioeconomic variables","Beijing","Guangzhou","eyes","spatial patterns","control measures","various influencing factors","ecological niche models","residents","fine scale","worldwide public health threat","crowded places","Shenzhen","results","spatiotemporal variations","coronavirus disease","interventions","date"],"language":"en"},

In an ageing society, Sweden\u0027s end-of-life (EoL) care is increasingly professionalised and specialised, but there is little community involvement. One goal of Studio D\u00F6Bra was therefore to support community engagement with EoL-related topics. Another goal was to create opportunities for interaction between children and older adults as there are few intergenerational meeting places. Two iterations of Studio D\u00F6Bra were developed (2016, 2018) in different Swedish cities, utilising a community-based participatory research approach. Project groups comprised first author MK and representatives of community organisations such as meeting places for older adults, after-school centres and artistic organisations. Each iteration engaged eight children and eight older adults in a series of five workshops. This article investigates how children and older adults motivate their participation, their experiences of participating and ways in which they were affected by participation. We also investigate how parents reflect on their child\u0027s participation in Studio D\u00F6Bra. Older adults, children and their parents were interviewed after each Studio D\u00F6Bra. An inductive qualitative process guided by interpretive description was used to analyse the transcripts. Findings indicate that participants acted as individuals with agency in connecting across generations and in creating spaces for engaging with EoL-topics, not only in Studio D\u00F6Bra but also in their social networks. Participants reflected on a changing sense of community through new intergenerational connections and social activities, and expressed a desire to maintain these. However, participants indicated sustainability challenges related to lacking agency in maintaining these spaces and sense of intergenerational community, as they rely on support from community organisations.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kleijberg, Max; Ahlberg, Beth Maina; Hilton, Rebecca; Tishelman, Carol","journal":"Health \u0026 social care in the community","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["older adults","children","goal of Studio D\u00F6Bra","community engagement","sense of intergenerational community","iterations of Studio D\u00F6Bra","representatives of community organisations","changing sense of community","community-based initiative","little community involvement","EoL-topics","participants","EoL-related topics","intergenerational meeting places","social activities","spaces","artistic organisations","parents","child\u0027s participation","support","new intergenerational connections","lacking agency","social networks","shared arts activities","author MK","collage","death","school centres","interaction","interpretive description","Sweden\u0027s end","inductive qualitative process","sculpture","loss","care","life","individuals","sustainability challenges","opportunities","Project groups","ageing society","generations","different Swedish cities","participatory research approach","experiences","series","article","games","Findings","desire","workshops","ways","transcripts"],"language":"en"},

A highlighted area of inadequacy surrounds the methodological limitations of measuring digital media use for both researchers and clinicians, alike. This protocol aims to (1) identify core concepts in the area of screen time and digital media use in children and adolescents (2) map existing research paradigms and screening/measurement tools that serve to underpin and operationalise core concepts and (3) provide an initial step in integrating these findings into a consolidated screening toolkit. It is expected this enterprise will help advance research and clinical evaluation in fields concerned with digital media use, namely medicine, child development and the social sciences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The planned scoping review will search relevant electronic databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus, in addition to grey literature. All empirical investigations and presentation of original research will be considered, and measurement/screening tools for digital media usage in children and adolescents will be identified and reported on. Two reviewers will pilot test the screening criteria, and data extraction forms prior to independently screening all relevant literature and extracting the data. A three-stage synthesis process will be used to map the existent measurement and screening tools for digital media usage in children and adolescents. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION There are no ethical considerations for this scoping review. Plans for dissemination include publication in a top-tier, open-access journal, public presentations and conference proceedings. Presentation of the full scoping review has been accepted to the American Academy of Child \u0026 Adolescent Psychiatry 66th Annual Meeting.","publish_time":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Browne, Dillon Thomas; May, Shealyn; Hurst-Della Pietra, Pamela; Christakis, Dimitri; Asamoah, Tracy; Hale, Lauren; Delrahim-Howlett, Katia; Emond, Jennifer A; Fiks, Alexander G; Madigan, Sheri; Prime, Heather; Perlman, Greg; Rumpf, Hans-J\u00FCrgen; Thompson, Darcy; Uzzo, Stephen; Stapleton, Jackie; Neville, Ross","journal":"BMJ open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-032184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772098/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ETHICS","American Academy of Child \u0026 Adolescent Psychiatry"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["digital media use","digital media usage","screening tools","digital media exposure","screening criteria","measurement tools","children","adolescents","consolidated screening toolkit","child development","advance research","INTRODUCTION Research","planned scoping review","presentation of original research","map existing research paradigms","existent measurement","relevant literature","DISSEMINATION","core concepts","American Academy of Child","grey literature","relevant electronic databases","area of screen time","highlighted area of inadequacy","data extraction forms","fields","methodological limitations","open-access journal","public presentations","Scopus","Ovid MEDLINE","Adolescent Psychiatry","clinical evaluation","relationship","medicine","PsycINFO","findings","conference proceedings","ethical considerations","tier","addition","Annual Meeting","empirical investigations","METHODS","ANALYSIS","researchers","social sciences","debate","publication","enterprise","clinicians","stage synthesis process","initial step","Plans","ETHICS","reviewers","protocol"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this review was to identify and describe the available patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) of sleep quality validated in adult people diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The COSMIN and PRISMA recommendations were followed. An electronic systematized search in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Science was carried out. Validation studies of PROMs of sleep quality in fibromyalgia published in English or Spanish were included. The selection of the studies was developed through a peer review process through the online software \u0022COVIDENCE\u0022. The quality of the studies was assessed using the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. A total of 5 PROMs were found validated in patients with fibromyalgia: (1) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), (2) Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), (3) Sleep Quality Numeric Rating Scale (SQ-NRS), (4) Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS), and (5) Fibromyalgia Sleep Diary (FSD). The quality of the evidence was very good and the quality of the results ranged from moderate to high. All the included PROMs, except for the FSD, showed adequate psychometric properties and, therefore, are valid and reliable tools for assessing sleep quality in the context of FM. However, none of the studies analyzed all the psychometric properties of the included PROMs as established in the COSMIN guidelines, highlighting that this is a potential field of research for future investigations.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Climent-Sanz, Carolina; Marco-Mitjavila, Anna; Pastells-Peir\u00F3, Roland; Valenzuela-Pascual, Fran; Blanco-Blanco, Joan; Gea-S\u00E1nchez, Montserrat","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17092992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jenkins"],"organizations":["PRISMA","ISI Web of Science","Sleep Quality Numeric","Fibromyalgia Sleep Diary"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Poor sleep quality","Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index","Fibromyalgia Sleep Diary","Sleep Quality Numeric Rating Scale","Jenkins Sleep Scale","included PROMs","Validation studies of PROMs","Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale","FSD","patients","COSMIN guidelines","adequate psychometric properties","COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist","electronic databases PubMed","electronic systematized search","peer review process","common concern","CINAHL","SQ-NRS","outcome measures","PsycINFO","online software","Scopus","troublesome symptom","PSQI","potential field of research","future investigations","available patient","results","MOS-SS","reliable tools","JSS","English","adult people","ISI Web of Science","COVIDENCE","evidence","PRISMA recommendations","Spanish","context of","purpose","selection","total"],"language":"en"},

Risk of bias was assessed by using the QUIPS tool (quality in prognosis studies). The primary analysis pooled associations only if they were adjusted for relevant confounders. The GRADE approach (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) was used to rate certainty in the evidence. RESULTS The primary analysis included 23 cohort studies. Of the pre-arrest factors, male sex (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.95, moderate certainty), age 60 or older (0.50, 0.40 to 0.62, low certainty), active malignancy (0.57, 0.45 to 0.71, high certainty), and history of chronic kidney disease (0.56, 0.40 to 0.78, high certainty) were associated with reduced odds of survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Of the intra-arrest factors, witnessed arrest (2.71, 2.17 to 3.38, high certainty), monitored arrest (2.23, 1.41 to 3.52, high certainty), arrest during daytime hours (1.41, 1.20 to 1.66, high certainty), and initial shockable rhythm (5.28, 3.78 to 7.39, high certainty) were associated with increased odds of survival. Intubation during arrest (0.54, 0.42 to 0.70, moderate certainty) and duration of resuscitation of at least 15 minutes (0.12, 0.07 to 0.19, high certainty) were associated with reduced odds of survival. CONCLUSION Moderate to high certainty evidence was found for associations of pre-arrest and intra-arrest prognostic factors with survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Due to the lack of high-quality evidence, it is difficult to draw a conclusion about optimal anti-shivering medication. The main purpose of this meta-analysis was to analyze and evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of ketamine for preventing postanesthetic shivering. METHODS We searched the following databases: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails for randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome observed was the difference of the incidence rate of postanesthetic shivering between ketamine group and placebo group. The secondary outcomes were the sedation score and incidence of the side effects caused by ketamine and any other drugs utilized in the studies. RESULTS In this meta-analysis, we analyzed a total of 16 trials including 1485 patients. Ketamine reduced the incidence rate of postanesthetic shivering compared to a placebo (odds ratio [OR]: 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06 to 0.26, P\u003C0.01). Regarding side effects, there was no evident variability of the incidence of nausea and vomiting. Usage of ketamine was associated with a lower rate of hypotension and bradycardia when compared to a placebo. Hallucinations were more frequently observed in patients who received higher doses of ketamine. No significant difference was found in the incidence of postanesthetic shivering with ketamine versus other pharmacological interventions. CONCLUSIONS Ketamine can prevent postanesthetic shivering without severe side effects. However, ketamine shows no advantage over other anti-shivering drugs.","publish_time":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yang; Mannan, Abdul; Han, Yuan; Liu, He; Guan, Hui-Lian; Gao, Xing; Dai, Ming-Sheng; Cao, Jun-Li","journal":"BMC anesthesiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-019-0910-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31888509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of postanesthetic","incidence rate of postanesthetic shivering","ketamine group","BACKGROUND Postanesthetic shivering","CONCLUSIONS Ketamine","Usage of ketamine","anti-shivering drugs","higher doses of ketamine","incidence of nausea","safety of prophylactic use of ketamine","postoperative patients","optimal anti-shivering medication","effects","placebo group","high-risk patients","meta-analysis","randomized controlled trials","lower rate of hypotension","postoperative complications","significant difference","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails","Embase","common complication of anesthesia","sedation score","following databases","Medline","bradycardia","evident variability","total","advantage","secondary outcomes","efficacy","main purpose","discomfort","lack of high-quality evidence","odds ratio","pharmacological interventions","confidence interval","METHODS","primary outcome","RESULTS","vomiting","studies","Hallucinations"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we have developed and evaluated a novel one-step single-tube nested quantitative Real-Time PCR (OSN-qRT-PCR) assay for highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting the ORF1aband N genes. The sensitivity of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was 1 copy/reaction and 10-fold higher than that of commercial qRT-PCR kit (10 copies/reaction). The clinical performance of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 181 clinical samples.

DATA SOURCES We performed a systematic search using Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Popline, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov (1990-2018) using MeSH terms related to maternal mortality, morbidity, and social determinants of health, and limited to the United States. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Selection criteria included studies examining associations between social determinants and adverse maternal outcomes including pregnancy-related death, severe maternal morbidity, and emergency hospitalizations or readmissions. Using Covidence, three authors screened abstracts and two screened full articles for inclusion. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Two authors extracted data from each article and the data were analyzed using a descriptive approach. A total of 83 studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Seventy-eight of 83 studies examined socioeconomic position or individual factors as predictors, demonstrating evidence of associations between minority race and ethnicity (58/67 studies with positive findings), public or no insurance coverage (21/30), and lower education levels (8/12), and increased incidence of maternal death and severe maternal morbidity. Only 2 of 83 studies investigated associations between these outcomes and socioeconomic, political, and cultural context (eg, public policy), and 20 of 83 studies investigated material and physical circumstances (eg, neighborhood environment, segregation), limiting the diversity of social determinants of health studied as well as evaluation of such evidence. CONCLUSION Empirical studies provide evidence for the role of race and ethnicity, insurance, and education in pregnancy-related mortality and severe maternal morbidity risk, although many other important social determinants, including mechanisms of effect, remain to be studied in greater depth.

Recently, several lines of evidence pointed to the fact that oncogenic activation of Myc family proteins is concomitant with reprogramming of tumor cells to cope with an enhanced need for metabolites during cell growth. These adaptions are driven by the ability of Myc proteins to act as transcriptional amplifiers in a tissue-of-origin specific manner. Here, we describe the effects of N-Myc overexpression on metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of N-Myc induced a glycolytic switch that was concomitant with enhanced sensitivity towards 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Moreover, global metabolic profiling revealed extensive alterations in the cellular metabolome resulting from overexpression of N-Myc. Limited supply with either of the two main carbon sources, glucose or glutamine, resulted in distinct shifts in steady-state metabolite levels and significant changes in glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, interference with glutamine-glutamate conversion preferentially blocked proliferation of N-Myc overexpressing cells, when glutamine levels were reduced. Thus, our study uncovered N-Myc induction and nutrient levels as important metabolic master switches in neuroblastoma cells and identified critical nodes that restrict tumor cell proliferation.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tjaden, Britta; Baum, Katharina; Marquardt, Viktoria; Simon, Mareike; Trajkovic-Arsic, Marija; Kouril, Theresa; Siebers, Bettina; Lisec, Jan; Siveke, Jens T; Schulte, Johannes H; Benary, Uwe; Remke, Marc; Wolf, Jana; Schramm, Alexander","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64040-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346009/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-Myc induction","Myc overexpression","Myc overexpressing cells","overexpression of N","effects of N","ability of Myc proteins","glutamine levels","neuroblastoma cells","blocked proliferation of N","reprogramming of tumor cells","Ectopic expression of N","metabolic reprogramming","oncogenic activation of Myc family proteins","tumor cell proliferation","nutrient levels","concomitant","tumor types","glutamine-glutamate conversion","global metabolic profiling","important metabolic master switches","steady-state metabolite levels","enhanced need","enhanced sensitivity","cell growth","significant changes","critical nodes","extensive alterations","distinct shifts","cellular metabolome","glycolytic switch","tissue","glutathione metabolism","main carbon sources","deoxyglucose","metabolites","transcriptional amplifiers","Limited supply","origin specific manner","interference","transcription factor","study","lines of evidence","poor patient prognosis","inhibitor of glycolysis","adaptions"],"language":"en"},

Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-Xray) was trained on 24,678 CXR images including 1,540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired CXR images (n=454) obtained in patients suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4th and April 6th 2020 in a single center (223 RT-PCR positive subjects, 231 RT-PCR negative subjects). The radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was performed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results For the test set, the mean age of the patients was 67.3 (\u002B/-14.4) years (56% male). Using RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified CXR images as COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.81. The system significantly outperforms each reader (p \u003C 0.001 using McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader can significantly outperform the AI system (p=0.04).

Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.

Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non-intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City. We included patients suspected of having COVID19 with hypoxia on arrival. A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO2. SpO2 measurements were recorded at triage and after five minutes of proning. Supplemental oxygenation methods included non-rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula. We also characterized post-proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED. RESULTS Fifty patients were included. Overall, the median SpO2 at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85). After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90). After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO2 improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95). Comparison of the pre- to post-median by the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test yielded P=0.001. Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED. CONCLUSION Awake early self-proning in the emergency department demonstrated improved oxygen saturation in our COVID-19positive patients. Further studies are needed to support causality and determine the effect of proning on disease severity and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caputo, Nicholas D; Strayer, Reuben J; Levitan, Richard","journal":"Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.13994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320506/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["OBJECTIVE Prolonged","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["minutes of proning","effect of proning","self-proning","management of patients","positive patients","non-intubated patients","use of early proning of awake","median SpO2","IQR","improved oxygen saturation","post-proning failure rates of intubation","oxygen saturations","hours of arrival","SpO2 measurements","adequate oxygen saturation","application of supplemental oxygen","emergency department","post-median","triage","Supplemental oxygenation methods","endotracheal intubation","unaddressed hypoxia","standard treatment","pilot study","non-rebreather mask","single urban ED","standard pulse oximeter","Wilcoxon Rank-sum test yielded P","NRB","New York City","ARDS","difficulty","disease severity","CONCLUSION","poor patient outcomes","nasal cannula","Comparison","causality","mortality","room air","RESULTS","COVID19","studies","purpose","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science-Direct, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for studies published up to December 2019. Articles that published as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and full-text articles published in English or other languages were included and participants were primi or multigravida women who were in active phase of labor. The intervention included HBB compared to placebo (normal saline) that was used during active phase of labor. Pooled estimates were measured using the fixed or random effect model, while the overall effect was reported in a mean difference (MD). All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS Twenty studies involving 3108 women were included in meta-analysis. Based on subgroup analysis by parity, use of HBB significantly reduced the duration of the first stage of labor in primigravida women (MD = - 57.73; 95% CI: [- 61.48, - 53.60]) and in multigravida women (MD = - 90.74; 95% CI: [- 97.24, - 84.24]). Administering HBB could reduce the second stages of labor in primigravidas and multigravidas about 6 min and 4 min respectively. Also, HBB reduced the duration of the third stage of labor in multigravidas about 3 min. APGAR score at one and 5 min after birth was not affected. The main maternal adverse effect was tachycardia and dry mouth. Labor duration in studies in which the participants were primi-and multigravida was not presented based on separate parities except for four papers, and the route of HBB administration was not the same across all studies. CONCLUSIONS Although, the effect of HBB was minimal when multigravidas and primigravidas women were considered together, the HBB was clinically effective in primigravida and multigravida women for shortening the first and the second stages of labor. Also, HBB could reduce the length of the third stage of labor in multigravidas.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohaghegh, Zaynab; Abedi, Parvin; Faal, Shahla; Jahanfar, Shayesteh; Surdock, Alayna; Sharifipour, Foruzan; Zahedian, Maryam","journal":"BMC pregnancy and childbirth","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-2832-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404072/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of HBB","stage of labor","Labor duration","stages of labor","multigravida women","labor progress","active phase of labor","primigravida women","primigravidas women","multigravidas","studies","route of HBB administration","MD","overall effect","meta-analysis","random effect model","participants","subgroup analysis","main maternal adverse effect","Science-Direct","Web of Science","systematic review","text articles","Review Manager","tachycardia","Cochrane Library","PubMed","Scopus","effectiveness of hyoscine n-butylbromide","dry mouth","RCTs","databases","randomized controlled trials","objective","papers","placebo","languages","normal saline","mean difference","English","BACKGROUND","parity","length","separate parities","APGAR score","Pooled estimates","METHODS","intervention","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","birth"],"language":"en"},

To improve the rehabilitation effectiveness of post-stroke patients, we developed a sensory stimulation-based continuous passive motion (CPM)-MT system with two different operating protocols, that is, asynchronous and synchronous modes. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measured brain activation through relative and absolute power spectral density (PSD) changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) mu rhythm in three cases with CMT and CPM-MT with asynchronous and synchronous modes. We also monitored changes in muscle fatigue, which is one of the negative effects of the CPM device, based on median power frequency (MPF) and root mean square (RMS). Relative PSD was most suppressed when subjects used the CPM-MT system under synchronous control: 22.11%, 15.31%, and 16.48% on Cz, C3, and C4, respectively. The absolute average changes in MPF and RMS were 1.59% and 9.78%, respectively, with CPM-MT. Synchronous mode CPM-MT is the most effective method for brain activation, and muscle fatigue caused by the CPM-MT system was negligible. This study suggests the more effective combination rehabilitation system for MT by utilizing CPM and magnetic-based MT task to add action execution and sensory stimulation compared with CMT.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Taewoong; Lee, Mina; Jeong, Taejong; Shin, Yong-Il; Park, Sung-Min","journal":"Sensors","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/s20082354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMT","CPM","RMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPM-MT system","Synchronous mode CPM-MT","conventional MT","CPM device","magnetic-based MT task","CMT","synchronous modes","effective combination rehabilitation system","effective method","synchronous control","brain activation","sensory stimulation","MPF","changes of electroencephalogram","Relative PSD","absolute average changes","RMS","muscle fatigue","absolute power spectral density","rehabilitation effectiveness of post-stroke patients","median power frequency","action execution","EEG","cases","continuous passive motion","subjects","mu rhythm","root mean square","different operating protocols","movement","study","negative effects","Robotic mirror therapy","Cz","C3","C4","affected limb"],"language":"en"},

Methods From May 2016 to December 2017, 78 patients underwent RAPN for renal tumors. Inner suture was performed in the opened collecting system or renal sinus, whereas parenchymal renorrhaphy was not. For hemostasis, the soft coagulation system was used, and absorbable hemostats were placed on the resection bed. CE-CT was carried out within 7 days after surgery. Data on these patients were prospectively collected. A single radiologist determined the diagnosis of RAP. Results Median (range) data were as follows: Patient age, 65 (19-82) years; radiographic tumor size, 30 (12-95) mm; operating time, 166 (102-294) min; warm ischemic time, 16 (7-67) min; and blood loss, 15 (0-4450) mL. One patient (1.6%) required a perioperative blood transfusion. No patient required conversion to open surgery or nephrectomy. CE-CT was carried out at median 6 (3-7) days after surgery. CE-CT showed no RAP development in all 61 patients. Urinary leakage was not observed. One patient had acute cholecystitis, a postoperative complication classified as Clavien-Dindo grade higher than 3, which was treated with cholecystectomy. Positive surgical margin was identified in four patients (6.6%). Conclusion RAPN using soft coagulation and absorbable hemostats without renorrhaphy appears to be feasible and safe. Our technique could eliminate the risk of RAP.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tohi, Yoichiro; Murata, Shiori; Makita, Noriyuki; Suzuki, Issei; Kubota, Masashi; Sugino, Yoshio; Inoue, Koji; Ueda, Hiroyuki; Kawakita, Mutsushi","journal":"Asian journal of urology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajur.2019.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31970068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CE-CT","patients","RAP development","parenchymal renorrhaphy","diagnosis of RAP","risk of RAP","Patient age","renal sinus","absorbable hemostats","soft coagulation system","renal tumors","Conclusion RAPN","Data","open surgery","days","partial nephrectomy","Results Median","operating time","blood loss","incidence of asymptomatic unruptured renal artery pseudoaneurysm","opened collecting system","warm ischemic time","perioperative blood transfusion","postoperative complication","contrast","robot","computed tomography","Clavien-Dindo grade higher","acute cholecystitis","conversion","radiographic tumor size","years","single radiologist","range","hemostasis","Positive surgical margin","Inner suture","resection bed","Objective","technique","Urinary leakage","Methods","cholecystectomy"],"language":"en"},

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses is limited. METHODS A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Descriptive, single factor, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. RESULTS The SOS (39.91\u00B112.92) and SAS scores (32.19\u00B17.56) of this nurse group were positively correlated (r=0.676, p\u003C0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that only children, working hours per week, and anxiety were the main factors affecting nurse stress (p=0.000, 0.048, 0.000, respectively).

Its decreased level on the cell surface correlates with poor prognosis in several tumor types. Aberrant stromal localization of syndecan-1 is also considered an unfavorable prognostic factor in various human malignancies. In the presented work the question was addressed if changes in syndecan-1 expression are related to the prognosis of cervical cancer. Immunohistochemistry for syndecan-1 extracellular domain was performed on surgical specimens of primary cervical cancer. To follow the communication between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts, their mono-and co-cultures were studied, detecting the expression of syndecan-1, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmin. Immunohistochemistry of tumorous specimens revealed that while cell surface syndecan-1 expression was reduced on cancer cells, it appeared on the surface of tumor-associated fibroblasts. Until year 7, the cohort with high cell surface syndecan-1 expression had significantly longer survival. No difference in the same time-period could be detected when stromal syndecan-1 expression was analyzed. In vitro analysis revealed, that tumor cells can induce syndecan-1 expression on fibroblast, and fibroblasts showed that fibroblast-like cells are built by two cell types: (a) syndecan-1 positive, cytokeratin negative real fibroblasts, and (b) syndecan-1 and cytokeratin positive epithelial-mesenchymal transformed tumor cells. Syndecan-1 on the surface of cancer cells appears to be a positive prognostic marker. Although syndecan-1 positive fibroblasts promote tumor cell proliferation in vitro, we failed to detect their cancer promoting effect in vivo.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kar\u00E1szi, Katalin; Vigh, Ren\u00E1ta; M\u00E1th\u00E9, Mikl\u00F3s; Full\u00E1r, Alexandra; Ol\u00E1h, L\u00E1szl\u00F3n\u00E9; F\u00FCle, Tibor; Papp, Zolt\u00E1n; Kovalszky, Ilona","journal":"Pathology oncology research : POR","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12253-020-00816-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of syndecan","cell-cell","stromal syndecan","high cell surface syndecan","surface of tumor","surface of cancer cells","cell types","tumor cell proliferation","cell surface correlates","positive fibroblasts","Aberrant stromal localization of syndecan","stromal fibroblasts","tumor types","cell-matrix interactions","cytokeratin positive epithelial-mesenchymal transformed tumor cells","associated fibroblasts","prognosis of cervical cancer","positive prognostic marker","cytokeratin negative real fibroblasts","surgical specimens of primary cervical cancer","Immunohistochemistry of tumorous specimens","poor prognosis","unfavorable prognostic factor","chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan necessary","transmembrane heparan","various human malignancies","smooth muscle actin","extracellular domain","mono","cohort","vimentin","question","decreased level","changes","communication","desmin","time-period","co-cultures","presented work","longer survival","difference","year","analysis","effect"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the RNA-binding N terminal domain (NTD) of the N protein was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of RNA binding. Two NTD structures of N proteins were selected (2OFZ and 1SSK, 92% homology) for virtual screening of 56,079 compounds from Asinex and Maybridge library to identify top 15 hits for each of the targets based on \u0022docking score\u0022. These top-hits were further screened for MM-GBSA binding free energy, pharmacokinetic properties (QikProp) and drug-likeness (SwissADME) and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Two suitable binders (ZINC00003118440 and ZINC0000146942) against the target 2OFZ were identified. ZINC00003118440 is a theophylline derivative under the drug class \u0027bronchodilEtors\u0027 and further screening with approved bronchodilators was also studied to identify their ability to bind to the RNA binding region on the N protein. The other identified top hit is ZINC0000146942, which is a 3,4dihydropyrimidone class molecule. Hence this study suggests two important class of compounds, theophylline and pyrimidone derivaties as possible inhibitors of RNA binding to the N terminal domain of N protein of coronavirus, thus opening new avenues for in vitro validations.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarma, Phulen; Sekhar, Nishant; Prajapat, Manisha; Avti, Pramod; Kaur, Hardeep; Kumar, Subodh; Singh, Sanjay; Kumar, Harish; Prakash, Ajay; Dhibar, Deba Prasad; Medhi, Bikash","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1753580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32266867/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N terminal domain of N protein of coronavirus","RNA-binding N terminal domain","RNA binding region","NTD structures of N proteins","sense RNA","identification of possible inhibitors of RNA binding","Nucleocapsid protein","drug class","CoV ribonucleoprotien","CoV RNP","important class of compounds","ZINC0000146942","ZINC00003118440","study","OFZ","hits","dihydropyrimidone class molecule","theophylline derivative","drug-likeness","virtual screening","complex","pyrimidone derivaties","QikProp","pharmacokinetic properties","results","free energy","Asinex","bronchodilEtors","molecular dynamics","GBSA","SwissADME","Maybridge library","new avenues","MD","studies","virus replication","targets","homology","suitable binders","approved bronchodilators","docking score","validations","SSK","ability"],"language":"en"},

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19, and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resources optimisation is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography.We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5\u002B days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system.In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014). Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings.Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shuo; Zha, Yunfei; Li, Weimin; Wu, Qingxia; Li, Xiaohu; Niu, Meng; Wang, Meiyun; Qiu, Xiaoming; Li, Hongjun; Yu, He; Gong, Wei; Bai, Yan; Li, Li; Zhu, Yongbei; Wang, Liusu; Tian, Jie","journal":"The European respiratory journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00775-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["automatic deep learning system","potential high-risk patients","fast screening COVID","Fast diagnosis of COVID","computed tomography images","medical resources optimisation","early prevention","medical resource optimisation","cities","provinces","viral pneumonia","AUC","good performance","pre-train","reported radiological findings","consistent characteristics","convenient tool","worse prognosis","time","hospital","abnormal areas","external validation sets","low-risk groups","prognostic analysis","significant difference","severe symptoms","human-assistance","regions","days","Coronavirus disease","lung features","follow-up"],"language":"en"},

The extent of covid-19 involvement in the central nervous system is not well established, and the presence or the absence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a topic of debate. CASE DESCRIPTION We present two patients with covid-19 and concurrent neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like symptoms due to covid-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients\u0027 CSF was repeatedly negative on real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease. CONCLUSION Our report shows that patients\u0027 CSF may be devoid of viral particles even when they test positive for covid-19 on a nasal swab. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in CSF may depend on the systemic disease severity and the degree of the virus\u0027 nervous tissue tropism and should be examined in future studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al Saiegh, Fadi; Ghosh, Ritam; Leibold, Adam; Avery, Michael B; Schmidt, Richard F; Theofanis, Thana; Mouchtouris, Nikolaos; Philipp, Lucas; Peiper, Stephen C; Wang, Zi-Xuan; Rincon, Fred; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Jabbour, Pascal; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Gooch, M Reid","journal":"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-323522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients\u0027 CSF","SARS-CoV","extent of covid","concurrent neurological disease","concurrent neurological symptoms","absence of SARS","severe acute respiratory syndrome","acute-onset severe headache","year-old woman","year-old man","novel corona virus","devoid of viral particles","central nervous system","systemic disease severity","nervous tissue tropism","subarachnoid haemorrhage","massive haemorrhagic conversion","ischaemic stroke","degree","real-time PCR analysis","Hunt","loss of consciousness","involvement","Hess grade","decompressive hemicraniectomy","BACKGROUND Emergence","cerebrospinal fluid","ruptured aneurysm","presence","CONCLUSION","report","CASE DESCRIPTION","topic of debate","nasal swab","future studies","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

However, there is currently no literature providing a comprehensive summation of evidence-based quantifiable risk of adverse events after rhinoplasty. Given this limitation, patients considering rhinoplasty are unable to fully ascertain pre-operative risk, and the ability of physicians to obtain true informed consent is similarly flawed. This systematic review provides the first rigorous, comprehensive and quantitative reporting of adverse events after rhinoplasty. METHODS This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018081826) in April 2018. Eligible articles were published in peer-reviewed journals with available abstracts and full-text articles. Interventions included primary functional, aesthetic, and combined functional/aesthetic rhinoplasty. The following data were extracted: Study size, population characteristics, indication, surgical approach, concomitant procedures, and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS A search yielded 3,215 publications for title and abstract screening. Two hundred and ninety-nine were eligible for full-text review. Thirty-six met final inclusion criteria. A total of 14 adverse events were reported among these studies, and included: need for revision, 0-10.9%; infection, 0-4%; dehiscence, 0-5%; bleeding, 0-4.1%; septal perforation, 0-2.6%; nasal airway obstruction requiring revision, 0-3%; hypertrophic scarring, 0-1.5%. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review presents the first comprehensive and quantitative reporting of adverse event frequency after rhinoplasty. This is a crucial tool for pre-operative patient counseling and an essential adjunct in the acquisition of informed consent. Future investigations will benefit from transparency and standardization of reporting to further quantify adverse event rates.","publish_time":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharif-Askary, Banafsheh; Carlson, Anna R; Van Noord, Megan G; Marcus, Jeffrey R","journal":"Plastic and reconstructive surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000006561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31860512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aesthetic rhinoplasty","incidence of adverse events","BACKGROUND Adverse events","quantitative reporting of adverse events","quantifiable risk of adverse events","adverse event rates","quantitative reporting of adverse event frequency","text review","systematic review","current American Society of Plastic Surgeons Rhinoplasty Consent","pre-operative risk","standardization of reporting","true informed consent","acquisition of informed consent","text articles","Eligible articles","revision","comprehensive summation of evidence","pre-operative patient counseling","indication","essential adjunct","surgical approach","concomitant procedures","Study size","population characteristics","available abstracts","ability of physicians","peer-reviewed journals","crucial tool","etiology","publications","title","transparency","abstract screening","following data","fact","nasal airway obstruction","literature","PROSPERO","Interventions","severity","limitation","patients","Future investigations","final inclusion criteria","search","METHODS","CRD42018081826","CONCLUSIONS","total","studies","septal perforation","hypertrophic scarring","infection","dehiscence","bleeding"],"language":"en"},

The publication time was limited to 2019 onward. After independent review by two authors, 14 studies with 228 confirmed cases were included in the analysis. A total of 60 patients developed skin rashes, and the age ranged from 8 to 84. Exanthematous eruptions potentially related to COVID-19 infection were highly variable and heterogeneous. Skin lesions mainly appeared erythematous, urticarial, and vesicular (chicken pox-like or varicelliform). Petechiae rash, livedo reticularis, and reactivation of oral HSV-1 were also observed in single cases. Newly reported eruptions like vascular lesions and peculiar (perniosis-like) skin lesions caused concern among dermatologists. Exanthems were widely distributed and were primarily located on the trunk. Associated symptoms, latency time, treatment, and prognosis were also carefully summarized.

FMT consists of the administration of fresh or frozen fecal microorganisms from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of diseased patients. At this time, in according to healthcare authorities, FMT is mainly used to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile. Despite the existence of a few existing stool banks worldwide and many studies of the FMT, there is no standard method for producing material for FMT, and there are a multitude of factors that can vary between the institutions. The main constraints for the therapeutic uses of FMT are safety concerns and acceptability. Technical and logistical issues arise when establishing such a non-standardized treatment into clinical practice with safety and proper governance. In this context, our manuscript describes a process of donor safety screening for FMT compiling clinical and biological examinations, questionnaires and interviews of donors. The potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation must be taken urgently into consideration. We discuss a standardized procedure of collection, preparation and cryopreservation of fecal samples through to the administration of material to patients, and explore the risks and limits of this method of FMT. The future success of medicine employing microbiota transplantation will be tightly related to its modulation and manipulation to combat dysbiosis. To achieve this goal, standard and strict methods need to be established before performing any type of FMT.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicco, Carole; Paule, Armelle; Konturek, Peter; Edeas, Marvin","journal":"Diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/diseases8020009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["method of FMT","type of FMT","therapeutic uses of FMT","Fecal Microbiota Transplantation","use of fecal microbiota","safety concerns","frozen fecal microorganisms","cryopreservation of fecal samples","administration of material","standard method","alteration of gut microbiota","process of donor safety screening","clinical practice","healthy donor","administration of fresh","intestinal tract of diseased patients","efficacious therapeutic strategy","intestinal microbial balance","non-standardized treatment","standardized procedure of collection","preparation","biological examinations","SARS-CoV","questionnaires","virus","existing stool banks","studies","manuscript","proper governance","future success of medicine","potential risk of transmission","interviews of donors","main constraints","existence","goal","strict methods","risks","healthcare authorities","limits","acceptability","logistical issues","recurrent Clostridium difficile","modulation","manipulation","dysbiosis","time","context","multitude of factors","institutions","consideration"],"language":"en"},

The document, which aims to propose treatment decision-making criteria in the face of exceptional imbalances between health needs and available resources, has produced strong reactions, within the medical-scientific community, in the academic world, and in the media. In the current context of international public health emergency caused by the CoViD-19 epidemic, this work aims to explain the ethical, deontological and legal bases of the SIAARTI Document and to propose methodologic and argumentative integrations that are useful for understanding and placing in context the decision-making criteria proposed. The working group that contributed to the drafting of this paper agrees that it is appropriate that healthcare personnel, who is particularly committed to taking care of those who are currently in need of intensive or sub-intensive care, should benefit from clear operational indications that are useful to orient care and, at the same time, that the population should know in advance which criteria will guide the tragic choices that may fall on each one of us. This contribution therefore firstly reflects on the appropriateness of the SIAARTI standpoint and the objectives of the SIAARTI Document.

The aim was to perform a systematic review of current evidences on clinical presentation of COVID-19, focusing on upper airway symptoms in order to help otolaryngologists identifying suspected cases. METHODS We searched PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases. RESULTS We included 5 retrospective clinical studies for a total of 1556 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 57.5% were male and mean age was 49.1 years. Pooled data revealed that pharyngodynia was present in 12.4% of patients, nasal congestion in 3.7%, and rhinorrhea was rare. No reports on COVID-19 and olfactory/gustative disorders matched inclusion criteria but preliminary evidences suggested they could be present. Common symptoms were fever (85.6%), cough (68.7%), and fatigue (39.4%). Frequent comorbidities were hypertension (17.4%), diabetes (3.8%), and coronary heart disease (3.8%); 83% of patients had alterations on chest computed tomography that were bilateral in 89.5% of cases. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (50%). Lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common.

Age is a major predictor of adverse outcome following ACS. COVID-19 infection seems to escalate the risk in older patients with heart disease. Increasing odds of in-hospital death is associated with older age following COVID-19 infection. Importantly, it seems older patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular IHD, diabetes and hypertension, are at the highest risk of mortality following COVID-19 infection. The evidence is sparse on the optimal care of older patients with ACS with lack of robust randomised controlled trials. In this setting, with the serious threat imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of rapidly evolving knowledge with much unknown, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment strategies offered to older patients. In cases where risks outweigh the benefits, it might not be an unreasonable option to treat such patients with a conservative or a palliative approach. Further evidence to elucidate whether invasive management is beneficial in older patients with ACS is required out-with the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, standardized analysis tools for IVPG quantification are missing. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, the test-retest observer reproducibility, and the inter-system variability of a semi-automated IVPG quantification algorithm. The study included forty healthy volunteers (50% were men). All volunteers were examined using two ultrasound systems, the Philips Epiq 7 and the General Electric Vivid 6. Left ventricular diastolic (DIVPG) and systolic (SIVPG) intraventricular pressure gradients were measured from the spatiotemporal distribution of intraventricular propagation flow velocities using color Doppler M-mode in standard apical views. There was good feasibility for both systolic and diastolic IVPG measurements (82.5% and 85%, respectively). Intra and inter-observer test-retest variability measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient were 0.98 and 0.93 for DIVPG respectively, and 0.95 and 0.89 for SIVPG respectively. The inter-system concordance was weak to moderate with Lin\u0027s concordance correlation coefficient of 0.59 for DIVPG and 0.25 for SIVPG. In conclusion, it is feasible and reproducible to assess systolic and diastolic IVPG using color Doppler M-mode in healthy volunteers.

Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August.

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Wei Ke; Wang, Ai Li; Xia, Fan; Xiao, Yan Ni; Tang, San Yi","journal":"Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["media data","media reports","media coverage","effectiveness of media reporting","daily number of media items","spread of COVID","severity of COVID","spreading","emergency disease","disease progression","number of cumulative deaths","number of cumulative confirmed cases","collected data","infection case data","effective vaccine","basic reproduction number","novel coronavirus disease","effective way","response rate","outbreak","early stage","Cross-correlation analysis","strong correlation","public awareness","peak size","peak time","initial stage","early phase","Sensitivity analysis","global public health","deterministic dynamical model","absence of specific therapeutic treatment","great concern","interaction","avenues","medical levels","prevention","control measures","world","parameterization","countries","findings","China"],"language":"en"},

The 2018 new definition proposed in May 2018 consists of new diagnostic criteria for PJI. We conducted a retrospective study and demonstrated that the new definition could improve the diagnostic efficiency in Chinese patients. However, missing data led to bias in the previous retrospective study. Therefore, this prospective study is designed to further validate the feasibility of 2018 new definition (and its modified version) for Chinese patients. METHODS/DESIGN This is a single-centre, prospective diagnostic study with 1 year of follow-up. The patients enrolled in the trial will be divided into a PJI group and an Aseptic group based on the eligibility criteria. We will recruit at least 70 patients for each group from October 2019 to October 2020. Blood samples, synovial fluid samples and intraoperative variables of all the included patients will be collected to assess various indicators. We will integrate the results of the various tests and examine the diagnostic efficiency (sensitivity and specificity) of five diagnostic criteria. DISCUSSION We design the prospective study in the hope of reducing the bias caused by missing data. Therefore, the prospective study will further support the conclusion of our preceding retrospective study. The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION Through this prospective study, we will validate the feasibility of the 2018 new PJI definition (and its modified version) for Chinese patients and determine the optimal method of PJI diagnosis.

It has previously been assessed for concurrent validity and inter-rater reliability. In this study we examine whether it is suitable for administration over the telephone. DESIGN AND METHODS We recruited a sample of 107 AOD clients across public sector specialist AOD treatment services in New South Wales, Australia between 2016 and 2018. Participants had a mean age of 47 years and 46% were female. Participants completed a face-to-face ATOP and a phone ATOP with a researcher within 5 days. Comparisons between the two administration modes were undertaken using Spearman\u0027s rank correlation coefficient for continuous or ordinal variables, and Cohen\u0027s Kappa for nominal variables. RESULTS Among 107 participants, 59% were attending for alcohol treatment and 41% for opioid treatment. Most ATOP items (76%) reached above 0.7 (good) or 0.9 (excellent) agreement between face-to-face and telephone use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the ATOP is a suitable instrument for telephone monitoring of recent substance use, health and social functioning among AOD clients.

METHODS Temporary Ark hospitals (TAH) have played an important role in controlling the spread of the epidemic in the city of Wuhan. Taking one TAH with 800 beds as an example, we summarized details of the layout, setting, working mode of medical staffs, patient management, admission standards, discharge standards, and standards for transferring to another hospital, hospital operation, and so on. RESULTS Over the period of operation, a total of 1,124 patients were admitted for treatment. Of these, 833 patients were cured and discharged from the hospital and 291 patients were transferred to other designated hospitals owing to aggravation of their condition. The achievement is to have zero infection for medical staff, zero in-hospital deaths among admitted patients, and zero readmission for discharged patients. CONCLUSION The rapid deployment of TAH provided a suitable place for treating mild/moderate or no asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and successfully helped to control the infection in Wuhan. The successful model of TAH would rapidly and effectively control the spread of COVID-19 in other cities. This article is protected by copyright.

SOURCES PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from inception to November 9, 2018 for studies that included both labour analgesia and the postpartum psychiatric disorders specified above. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Two reviewers assessed the studies and extracted the data. Of the 990 identified citations, 17 studies were included for analysis. Existing studies have small sample sizes and are observational cohorts in design. Patient psychiatric risk factors, method of delivery, and type of labour analgesia received were inconsistent among studies. Most studies relied on screening tests for diagnosing postpartum psychiatric illness and did not assess the impact of labour analgesia on postpartum psychiatric illness as the primary study objective. CONCLUSIONS Future studies should correlate screen-positive findings with clinical diagnosis; consider adjusting the timing of screening to include the antepartum period, early postpartum, and late postpartum periods; and consider the degree of labour pain relief and the specific pharmacologic labour analgesia used when evaluating postpartum psychiatric disorders.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munro, Allana; MacCormick, Hilary; Sabharwal, Atul; George, Ronald B","journal":"Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d\u0027anesthesie","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01587-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32020416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["postpartum psychiatric disorders","postpartum psychiatric illness","postpartum anxiety","postpartum depression","type of labour analgesia","impact of labour analgesia","late postpartum periods","Existing studies","specific pharmacologic labour analgesia","use of pharmacologic labour analgesia","epidural analgesia","CONCLUSIONS Future studies","postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder","degree of labour pain relief","Patient psychiatric risk factors","screening tests","timing of screening","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","screen-positive findings","planning of future research","parenteral opioids","method of delivery","small sample sizes","observational cohorts","clinical diagnosis","possible relationship","nitrous oxide","antepartum period","current literature","primary study objective","PsycINFO","CINAHL","knowledge gaps","EMBASE","SOURCES PubMed","design","reviewers","identified citations","inception","PURPOSE","data","analysis"],"language":"en"},

However, these SNPs explain only 25% of the overall genetic variance and suggest a role of rare variants in BD vulnerability. Here, we combined high-throughput genotyping data and whole-exome sequencing in cohorts of individuals with BD as well as in multiplex families with a high density of affected individuals in order to determine the contribution of both common and rare variants to BD genetic vulnerability. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS), we showed a strong contribution of common polymorphisms previously associated with BD and schizophrenia (SZ) and noticed that those specifically associated with SZ contributed more in familial forms of BD than in non-familial ones. The analysis of rare damaging variants shared by affected individuals in multiplex families with BD revealed a single interaction network enriched in neuronal and developmental biological pathways, as well as in the regulation of gene expression. We identified four genes with a higher mutation rate in individuals with BD than in the general population and showed that mutations in two of them were associated with specific clinical manifestations. In addition, we showed a significant negative correlation between PRS and the number of rare damaging variants specifically in unaffected individuals of multiplex families. Altogether, our results suggest that common and rare genetic variants both contribute to the familial aggregation of BD and this genetic architecture may explain the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations in multiplex families.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Courtois, Elisa; Schmid, Mark; Wajsbrot, Orly; Barau, Caroline; Le Corvoisier, Philippe; Aouizerate, Bruno; Bellivier, Frank; Belzeaux, Raoul; Dubertret, Caroline; Kahn, Jean-Pierre; Leboyer, Marion; Olie, Emilie; Passerieux, Christine; Polosan, Mircea; Etain, Bruno; Jamain, St\u00E9phane","journal":"Translational psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-0783-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BD vulnerability","BD genetic vulnerability","rare genetic variants","familial forms of BD","familial aggregation of BD","role of rare variants","unaffected individuals of multiplex families","number of rare damaging variants","analysis of rare damaging variants","cohorts of individuals","strong contribution of common polymorphisms","high density of affected individuals","genetic architecture","additive polygenic contribution of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms","PRS","overall genetic variance","SNPs","SZ","non-familial ones","heterogeneity of clinical manifestations","specific clinical manifestations","single interaction network","polygenic risk scores","high-throughput genotyping data","exome sequencing","bipolar disorders","Genome-wide association studies","higher mutation rate","significant negative correlation","developmental biological pathways","general population","genes","schizophrenia","results","regulation of gene expression","mutations","addition"],"language":"en"},

Cefixime (CEF) is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is used against bacterial infections. In the present study, Raman spectroscopy has been applied for the identification and quantification of Raman spectral features of cefixime with different concentrations of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and excipients in solid dosage forms. The changes in Raman spectral features of API and excipients in the solid dosage forms of cefixime were studied and Raman peaks were assigned based on the literature. Multivariate data analysis techniques including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Regression analysis (PLSR) have been performed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of solid dosage forms of cefixime. PCA was found helpful in differentiating all the Raman spectral data associated with the different solid dosage forms of cefixime. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean relative error (MRE) for the calibration data-set were 0.99, 0.72, and 0.01 respectively and for the validation data-set were 0.99, 3.15, and 0.02 respectively, that shows the performance of the model.

Patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers should be directed to online resources e.g. Society for Endocrinology, Royal Osteoporosis Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, specific patient groups and the European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Endocrine and Rare Bone disorders. For patients in acute hospital settings, existing emergency guidance on the management of hyper- and hypo-calcaemia should be followed. A pragmatic, symptom-based approach should be implemented in patients at the end of life. An approach to osteoporosis management is outlined.

The porosity and the x-ray greyscale of specimens taken from bone transport studies in sheep were assessed by means of ex vivo imaging. Our study demonstrates that the porosity of the woven bone in the distraction area diminishes during the healing process from 73.3% 35 days after surgery to 31.9% 525 days after surgery. In addition, the woven bone\u0027s porosity is negatively correlated with its Young\u0027s modulus. The x-ray greyscale, was measured as an indicator of the level of mineralization of the woven bone. Greyscale index has been demonstrated to be inversely proportional to porosity and to increase to up to 60-80% of the level in cortical bone.

They are commonly treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) through a needle inserted into the nidus of the lesion under CT guidance, which is associated with exposure of young patients to relatively high dose of radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the amount of radiation, effectiveness and safety of an alternative imaging approach, the 3D image-guided (O-arm) technology and the Stealth navigation. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 52 electronic medical files of patients (mean age 24.7 years, range 8-59 years) who were treated with thermal ablation of benign osteoid osteomas guided by the navigated O-arm-assisted technique in our institution between 2015 and 2017. Data were extracted on the associated complications, the reduction in pain at 3 months and one year postoperatively, and the amount of radiation administered during the procedure. RESULTS The level of pain on a visual analogue scale decreased from the preoperative average of 7.73 to 0 at the 3-month follow-up. The mean dose-length product was 544.7 mGycm2 compared to the reported radiation exposure of 1971-7946 mGycm2 of CT-guided radio ablations. The one intra-operative complication was a superficial burn in the subcutaneous lesion in a tibia that was treated locally with no major influence on recovery. CONCLUSIONS RFA ablation guided by 3D O-arm stealth navigation is as effective as the traditional CT-guided technique with the advantage of lower radiation exposure.

However, physiological mechanisms of enhanced salt tolerance in leaves and roots of trees rarely have been compared. To reveal the different mechanisms, our study utilized comprehensive analyses of leaves and roots to examine the effects of Funneliformis mosseae on the salinity tolerance of Zelkova serrata. Seedlings of Z. serrata were exposed to four salt levels in a greenhouse with and without F. mosseae inoculation. Treatment comparisons revealed that following F. mosseae inoculation, (1) nutrient deficiency caused by osmotic stress was mitigated by the fungus enhancing nutrient contents (K, Ca, and Mg) in roots and (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) in leaves, with Ca and K contents being higher in both leaves and roots; (2) mycorrhizas alleviated ion toxicity by maintaining a favorable ion balance (e.g., K\u002B/Na\u002B), and this regulatory effect was higher in leaves than that in roots; and (3) oxidative damage was reduced by an increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and accumulation of antioxidant compounds in mycorrhizal plants although the increase differed in leaves and roots. In particular, AM fungus-enhanced catalase activity and reduced glutathione content only occurred in leaves, whereas an enhanced content of reduced ascorbic acid was only noted in roots. Growth, root vitality, leaf photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthetic rate, and dry weight were higher in seedlings with AM fungus inoculation.

Additionally, the association between histologic severity and clinical signs in ferrets is unknown. We evaluated enteric samples from ferrets diagnosed with IBD, compared histologic grading schemes, and correlated the results with the severity of clinical signs. Enteric sections from 23 ferrets with IBD were analyzed using grading schemes for intestinal inflammation in cats and dogs, and a correlation with clinical signs was evaluated. After dividing the histologic samples into groups based on the severity of clinical signs, main histologic differences were identified. Age and sex were also assessed for correlation with clinical signs. No significant correlation was found between the 2 grading schemes and clinical signs (rho = 0.02, p = 0.89; rho = 0.26, p = 0.18, respectively). Degree of villus fusion, hemorrhage and/or fibrin, epithelial damage, inflammation density, and crypt abscess formation were used retrospectively to create a ferret IBD grading scheme, which was significantly correlated with the severity of clinical signs (rho = 0.48, p = 0.01).

Protective ileostomy (PI) during anterior resection (AR) for rectal cancer decreases the incidence of anastomotic leakage (AL) and its subsequent complications, but it may itself be the cause of morbidity. The aim is to report our protocol in the management of selected patients with borderline risk to develop AL after laparoscopic AR and ghost ileostomy (GI) creation. Methods. Patients who underwent AR were stratified based on the risk to develop AL. Steps to avoid PI were splenic flexure mobilization, reduced pelvic bleeding, to employ different stapler charge if neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy is performed, to perform a horizontal section of the rectum, to evaluate the anastomotic vascularization with a fluorescence angiography, to perform a side-to-end anastomosis, intraoperative methylene blue test, pelvic and transanal drainage tubes placement, and the GI creation. After surgery, inflammatory blood markers were monitored to detect potential leakages. Results. Twelve patients were included. In one case, the specimen proximal section was changed after fluorescence angiography. There were no conversions in this group of patients. One postoperative AL occurred and was treated with radiological drainage placement, not being necessary to convert the GI. PI was avoided in 100% of cases. Conclusions. Patients\u0027 characteristics cannot be changed, but several steps were used to avoid routine PI creation. The present protocol could be a valuable option to avoid PI in selected patients. Further studies with a wider sample size, and defined criteria to stratify the patients based on the risk to develop AL, are required.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morales-Conde, Salvador; Alarc\u00F3n, Isaias; Yang, Tao; Licardie, Eugenio; Balla, Andrea","journal":"Surgical innovation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350619890720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31789117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group of patients","management of selected patients","routine PI creation","GI creation","postoperative AL","laparoscopic AR","borderline risk","fluorescence angiography","Steps","radiological drainage placement","pelvic bleeding","transanal drainage tubes placement","ghost ileostomy","anastomotic vascularization","Protective ileostomy","present protocol","horizontal section","incidence of anastomotic leakage","specimen proximal section","intraoperative methylene blue test","different stapler charge","rectal cancer","anterior resection","splenic flexure mobilization","valuable option","wider sample size","end anastomosis","defined criteria","neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy","inflammatory blood markers","rectum","surgery","studies","potential leakages","subsequent complications","conversions","Patients\u0027 characteristics","cause of morbidity","aim","Results","cases","Conclusions","Purpose","Methods"],"language":"en"},

This article aims to report and discuss the data of the first 8 weeks of COVID-19 epidemic in the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Parma. METHODS The ED visits were analyzed as follows: total ED visits, divided in COVID-19/ non-COVID-19 cases, and in trauma-related/non-trauma-related cases; outcome (i.e., discharged, admitted, dead in the ED) of patients, altogether or stratified according to triage class; age classes of the entire ED population. RESULTS Total ED visits decreased starting from the first days of the outbreak, then exhibiting progressive growth afterwards. COVID suspected cases rapidly increased, whereas non-COVID suspected dropped and remained well below the standard. Trauma-related cases declined, both as ED visits and as hospital admissions. The percentage and absolute number of patients admitted to hospital wards progressively increased, rapidly overwhelming the number of cases that could be discharged. The admission rate in the lowest priority classes also displayed a marked increase. The youngest age classes dramatically declined, whilst the oldest progressively increased, remaining considerably over the standard rate of the local ED. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged the health care systems to undergo a paradigm shift. Even triage criteria have partially lost their meaning, as shown by the dramatic increase of hospital admissions, even in the lowest priority classes. A deep re-organizational process of the ED was undertaken. Hospitals must be constantly resilient and prepared to these new emergencies in terms of equipment, medical and nurses staff, larger bed capacity in short time, availability of intensive and sub-intensive beds, and flexibility.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Comelli, Ivan; Scioscioli, Francesco; Cervellin, Gianfranco","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-COVID","COVID suspected cases","weeks of COVID","RESULTS Total ED visits","non-trauma-related cases","number of cases","entire ED population","lowest priority classes","hospital wards","youngest age classes","dramatic increase of hospital admissions","University Hospital of Parma","standard rate","absolute number of patients","availability of intensive","admission rate","marked increase","triage class","triage criteria","sub-intensive beds","health care systems","regional health services","larger bed capacity","nurses staff","short time","terms of equipment","pandemic","CONCLUSIONS","epidemic","new emergencies","spread of coronavirus disease","deep re-organizational process","emergency department","outcome","paradigm shift","outbreak","BACKGROUND","meaning","response","Italy","flexibility","percentage","progressive growth","days","dead","METHODS","Hospitals","data","article"],"language":"en"},

Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients. Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient. METHODS Sixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. RESULTS Three patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome. Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission. In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration. In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively. Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures. We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.

METHODS Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSIONS The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Jinghui; Yuan, Yuxin; Wang, Dong","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Patient Health Questionnaire"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mental health status of college students","severe anxiety","different levels of anxiety","epidemic of COVID","severe depression","Patient Health Questionnaire","Generalized Anxiety Disorder","overall incidence of anxiety","likeliness of depression","general questionnaire","precision mental health education","future health behaviors","cognitive behavior questionnaire","internet-based questionnaire survey","incidences of mild","factors","excessive negative information","higher level of awareness","high level of awareness","related departments","Depressive emotions","results of multivariate analysis","self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge","non-medical majors","drinking history","residence","reporting half","greater changes","suburbs","female gender","rural areas","GAD","older age","colleges","CONCLUSIONS","multinomial-logistic regression model","Guangdong Province","OBJECTIVE","PHQ","METHODS","collected data"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that the lower ratio of DSi to[Formula: see text] (0.044 \u00B1 0.001) was mainly controlled by the domination of carbonate mineral in the sedimentary rock of the Yalongjiang River drainage basin. The DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio was positively correlated with discharge (P \u003C 0.05), and negatively correlated with the water retention time (P \u003C 0.01) and chlorophyll a, implying that the variations of DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio were mainly determined by the rock chemical weathering processes and the hydrologic process outside the reservoirs and the biological processes within the cascade reservoirs. The phytoplankton photosynthetic process stoichiometrically assimilated DSi and [Formula: see text], resulted in 3.46 \u00D7 104 t\u00B7Si a-1 and 1.89 \u00D7 104 t\u00B7C a-1 sequestering in the cascade reservoirs, respectively. Compared with the situation of dam-free in the lower reaches of Yalongjiang River, the export flux of [Formula: see text] and DSi at the mouth of Yalongjiang River was reduced by 11.87% and 62.50%, respectively; the ratio of DSi:[Formula: see text] decreased by 36.01% for only building the Ertan dam and 53.15% for the cascade damming, respectively. The water renewal time prolonged from 45 to 126.6 days due to the regulation of the cascade reservoirs in the mainstream. Ultimately, a conceptual model on migration-transformation of DIC and DSi within the cascade reservoirs in the lower reaches of Yalongjiang River was established. These findings demonstrated that riverine cascade damming could extend the biogeochemical coupling cycle of DIC and DSi within the inland aquatic ecosystems and ensure the ecological environment security in the hot-dry valley.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Haojun; Tao, Zhen; Gao, Quanzhou; Yao, Ling; Feng, Yong; Li, Yinhua; Ding, Jian; Wang, Zhengang; Lyu, Xiaoxi; Xu, Peng","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09174-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DIC"],"locations":["Yalongjiang River"],"keyphrases":["cascade reservoirs","Formula","text","lower ratio of DSi","assimilated DSi","variations of DSi","riverine cascade damming","lower reaches of Yalongjiang River","mouth of Yalongjiang River","Yalongjiang River drainage basin","biogeochemical coupling cycle of DIC","dissolved silicon","dry season","water samples","water retention time","water renewal time prolonged","biogeochemical cycle of riverine dissolved inorganic carbon","sedimentary rock","hydrologic process","rock chemical weathering processes","biological processes","wet season","situation of dam","Ertan dam","phytoplankton photosynthetic process","hot-dry valley","ecological environment security","inland aquatic ecosystems","migration-transformation","export flux","sequestering","southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","environmental factors","domination of carbonate mineral","bicarbonate","conceptual model","days","regulation","findings","chlorophyll","discharge","results","mainstream"],"language":"en"},

Methods Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Scoping Reviews guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of primary studies that identified a theory/framework explaining the aetiology of suicidal behaviour in adulthood, following childhood exposure to external-cause parental death, including suicide. Results The search yielded 1598 articles. Following full-text screening, 23 studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Data extraction was then completed and found that the studies collectively referenced nine theories. The specific theories identified covered a range of biopsychosocial frameworks and included attachment theory, familial transmission of suicide, conservation of resources framework, diathesis-stress model, social integration theory, socio-ecological model, social learning theory, critical period hypothesis or life course approach and the developmental model of antisocial behaviour. Limitations It was beyond the scope of this review to conduct rigorous testing and evaluation of the theories identified. Future research could extend on this study by developing criteria to assess the range of theories and frameworks on suicide exposure, as well as the studies providing evidence for these theories, in order to guide more advanced theory development as well as policies, programs and interventions. Conclusions Based on these theories, the authors proposed that using an integrated biopsychosocial model will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse risk and protective factors for suicidal behaviour following parental death.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Phuong; Maple, Myfanwy; Hay, Kieran; Bugeja, Lyndal","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426539/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["range of theories","suicide exposure","specific theories","attachment theory","parental death","social learning theory","social integration theory","childhood exposure","scoping review of primary studies","offspring suicide","advanced theory development","integrated biopsychosocial model","developmental model of antisocial behaviour","socio-ecological model","diathesis-stress model","aetiology of suicidal behaviour","familial transmission of suicide","range of biopsychosocial frameworks","Background Exposure","Systematic Reviews","Meta-Analyses - Scoping Reviews guidelines","conservation of resources framework","meeting inclusion criteria","critical period hypothesis","life course approach","protective factors","diverse risk","Preferred Reporting Items","adulthood","policies","comprehensive understanding","order","rigorous testing","evaluation","theoretical models","programs","Methods","study","scope","authors","evidence","Future research","interventions","relationship","text screening","articles","Data extraction","Limitations","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

These compounds were specifically designed to mimic all faces of the arginine-rich \u03B1-helix of the HIV-1 protein Rev, which forms deeply embedded RNA complexes and plays key roles in the virus replication cycle. Two of these molecules recognized the Rev site in the viral RNA and inhibited the formation of the RRE-Rev ribonucleoprotein complex, a currently unexploited target in HIV chemotherapy. Cellular assays revealed that the most active compounds blocked HIV-1 replication with little toxicity, and likely exerted this effect through a multi-target mechanism involving inhibition of viral LTR promoter-dependent transcription and Rev function. Further development of this scaffold may open new avenues for targeting nucleic acids and may complement current HIV therapies, none of which involve inhibitors interfering with the gene regulation processes of the virus.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Medina-Trillo, Cristina; Sedgwick, Daniel M; Herrera, Lidia; Beltr\u00E1n, Manuela; Moreno, \u00C1ngela; Barrio, Pablo; Bedoya, Luis M; Alcam\u00ED, Jos\u00E9; Fustero, Santos; Gallego, Jos\u00E9","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64120-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein Rev","relevant protein-protein","Rev function","Rev site","HIV chemotherapy","viral RNA","protein-nucleic acid interactions","inhibitors","current HIV therapies","active compounds","RRE-Rev ribonucleoprotein complex","multi-target mechanism","virus replication cycle","unexploited target","nucleic acids","arginine-rich \u03B1-helix","multi-facial helix mimetics","substituted p-terphenyl compounds","aromatic scaffold","three-dimensional structure of \u03B1","embedded RNA complexes","Small synthetic molecules","inhibition of viral LTR promoter-dependent transcription","key roles","application of novel","positions","helices","formation","applications","aminoalkyl groups","new avenues","gene regulation processes","effect","little toxicity","synthesis","infancy","faces","design","Cellular assays","development"],"language":"en"},

Ramping up the testing capacity of a country supposes an essential public health response to this new outbreak. A Pool testing strategy where multiple samples are tested in a single RT-PCR kit could potentially increase a country\u0027s testing capacity. The aim of this study is to propose a simple mathematical model to estimate the optimum number of pooled samples according to the relative prevalence of positive tests in a particular healthcare context, assuming that if a group tests negative, no further testing is done whereas if a group tests positive, all the subjects of the group are retested individually. The model predicts group sizes that range from 11 to 3 subjects. For a prevalence of 10% of positive tests, 40.6% of tests can be saved using testing groups of 4 subjects. For a 20% prevalence, 17.9% of tests can be saved using groups of 3 subjects. For higher prevalences, the strategy flattens and loses effectiveness. Pool testing individuals for SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable strategy that could considerably boost a country\u0027s testing capacity. However, further studies are needed to address how large these groups can be, without losing sensitivity on the RT-PCR. The strategy best works in settings with a low prevalence of positive tests. It is best implemented in subgroups with low clinical suspicion. The model can be adapted to specific prevalences, generating a tailored to the context implementation of the pool testing strategy.

Robotic surgery is increasing in popularity; however, the risk of stray energy transfer during robotic surgery is unknown. The purpose of this study was to (1) quantify stray energy transfer using robotic instrumentation, (2) determine strategies to minimize the transfer of energy, and (3) compare robotic stray energy transfer to laparoscopy. METHODS In a laparoscopic trainer, a monopolar instrument (L-hook) was activated with DaVinci Si (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA) robotic instruments. A camera and assistant grasper were inserted to mimic a minimally invasive cholecystectomy. During activation of the L-hook, the non-electric tips of the camera and grasper were placed adjacent to simulated tissue (saline-soaked sponge). The primary outcome was change in temperature from baseline (\u00B0C) measured nearest the tip of the non-electric instrument. RESULTS Simulated tissue nearest the robotic grasper increased an average of 18.3 \u00B1 5.8 \u00B0C; p \u003C 0.001 from baseline. Tissue nearest the robotic camera tip increased (9.0 \u00B1 2.1 \u00B0C; p \u003C 0.001). Decreasing the power from 30 to 15 W (18.3 \u00B1 5.8 vs. 2.6 \u00B1 2.7 \u00B0C, p \u003C 0.001) or using low-voltage cut mode (18.3 \u00B1 5.8 vs. 3.1 \u00B1 2.1 \u00B0C, p \u003C 0.001) reduced stray energy transfer to the robotic grasper. Desiccating tissue, in contrast to open air activation, also significantly reduced stray energy transfer for the grasper (18.3 \u00B1 5.8 vs. 0.15 \u00B1 0.21 \u00B0C, p \u003C 0.001) and camera (9.0 \u00B1 2.1 vs. 0.24 \u00B1 0.34 \u00B0C, p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Stray energy transfer occurs during robotic surgery. The assistant grasper carries the highest risk for thermal injury. Similar to laparoscopy, stray energy transfer can be reduced by lowering the power setting, utilizing a low-voltage cut mode instead of coagulation mode and avoiding open air activation. These practical findings can aid surgeons performing robotic surgery to reduce injuries from stray energy.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Overbey, Douglas M; Carmichael, Heather; Wikiel, Krzysztof J; Hirth, Douglas A; Chapman, Brandon C; Moore, John T; Barnett, Carlton C; Jones, Teresa S; Robinson, Thomas N; Jones, Edward L","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07605-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transfer of energy","robotic stray energy transfer","robotic grasper","risk of stray energy transfer","INTRODUCTION Stray energy transfer","CONCLUSIONS Stray energy transfer","Robotic surgery","robotic instrumentation","robotic instruments","robotic camera tip","monopolar radiofrequency energy","assistant grasper","laparoscopy","Desiccating tissue","open air activation","coagulation mode","monopolar instrument","hook","non-electric instrument","low-voltage","baseline","non-electric tips","highest risk","power setting","Sunnyvale","surgeons","contrast","injuries","DaVinci Si","laparoscopic trainer","temperature","thermal injury","practical findings","saline-soaked sponge","popularity","strategies","RESULTS","average","primary outcome","METHODS","purpose","study","invasive cholecystectomy"],"language":"en"},

Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Wei; Zhang, Yu; Jiang, Jing; Lucas, Molly V; Fonzo, Gregory A; Rolle, Camarin E; Cooper, Crystal; Chin-Fatt, Cherise; Krepel, Noralie; Cornelssen, Carena A; Wright, Rachael; Toll, Russell T; Trivedi, Hersh M; Monuszko, Karen; Caudle, Trevor L; Sarhadi, Kamron; Jha, Manish K; Trombello, Joseph M; Deckersbach, Thilo; Adams, Phil; McGrath, Patrick J; Weissman, Myrna M; Fava, Maurizio; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Arns, Martijn; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Etkin, Amit","journal":"Nature biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0397-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32042166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EEG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antidepressant sertraline","state EEG signature","EEG equipment","sertraline-predictive EEG signature","neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment","placebo-controlled antidepressant study","personalized treatment of depression","general antidepressant medication responsivity","repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome","depression samples","neurobiological signature of response","concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation","clinical diagnosis of major depression","clinical avenue","state electroencephalography","prefrontal neural responsivity","different study sites","latent-space machine-learning algorithm","computational model","efficacy relative","manner","heterogeneous conditions","largest imaging","data","findings","Symptom improvement","Antidepressants"],"language":"en"},

Viral findings were prospectively studied in lower respiratory tract infections in small children with and without expiratory difficulties. On first admission, a viral aetiology was found in 71 of 127 children (56%). On re\u2010admission, a viral etiology was found in only two of 31 cases (6%). Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) were responsible for 71% of the cases with viral diagnoses. A recently\u2010developed method for the direct detection of viral antigens in nasopharyngeal specimens by radio\u2010immunoassay was more sensitive than complement fixation serology, especially in patients aged less than six months. Viral diagnosis was reached using this new method alone in 43% of infections caused by RSV and in 27% of infections caused by other viruses. In children under six months, RSV were found in 89% by direct antigen detection and in 22% by serology. We suggest that direct antigen detection should be used as the primary virological method in small children with lower respiratory tract infections. The aetiological agents were the same in cases with and without expiratory difficulties, RSV being found in about 40% of children in both instances. It is concluded that host factors are critical to the development of expiratory difficulties.","publish_time":"2008-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"KORPPI, M.; HALONEN, P.; KLEEMOLA, M.; LAUNIALA, K.","journal":"Acta Paediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edc3f166dce9f249f51efde16e1d996e2696245f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV","small children","viral etiology","Viral diagnosis","Viral findings","viral aetiology","viral diagnoses","direct detection of viral antigens","cases","lower respiratory tract infections","direct antigen detection","development of expiratory difficulties","Respiratory syncytial viruses","new method","months","primary virological method","fixation serology","re\u2010admission","nasopharyngeal specimens","radio","immunoassay","host factors","patients","aetiological agents","instances","ABSTRACT"],"language":"en"},

Second, we focused on TCM\u0027s therapeutic effects and gut microbiome\u0027s mediation roles, including the relationships among diet, gut microbiome, and health care. Third, we have summarized some databases and tools to help understand the impact of TCM and gut microbiome on diagnosis and treatment at the molecular level. Finally, we introduce the effects of gut microbiome on TCM and host health, with two case studies, one on the metabolic effect of gut microbiome on TCM, and another on cancer treatment. In summary, we have reviewed the current status of the two components of healthcare: TCM and gut microbiome, as well as their concert effects. It is quite clear that as the holobiont, the maintenance of the health status of human would depend heavily on TCM, gut microbiome, and their combined effects.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Runzhi; Gao, Xi; Bai, Hong; Ning, Kang","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4710bfe80c296b8a376d8adb5aa0279ffb341d67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of gut microbiome","gut microbiome research","metabolic effect of gut microbiome","importance of TCM","impact of TCM","relationship of TCM","gut microbiome\u0027s mediation roles","combined effects","concert effects","current status","health status of human","host health","paradigm shift","health care","TCM\u0027s therapeutic effects","components of healthcare","cancer treatment","relationships","diagnosis","traditional Chinese medicine","diet","case studies","maintenance","topics","review","molecular level","holobiont","systems biology","Advances","tools","omics approaches","interplay","line","databases","summary"],"language":"en"},

We observed that standard machine learning methods alone performed somewhat poorly on the disease phenotype prediction task; therefore we devised an approach augmenting machine learning with topological data analysis. We describe a framework for predicting phenotype values by utilizing gene expression data transformed into sample-specific topological signatures by employing feature subsampling and persistent homology. The topological data analysis approach developed in this work yielded improved results on Parkinson\u2019s disease phenotype prediction when measured against standard machine learning methods. This study confirms that gene expression can be a useful indicator of the presence or absence of a condition, and the subtle signal contained in this high dimensional data reveals itself when considering the intricate topological connections between expressed genes.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mandal, Sayan; Guzm\u00E1n-S\u00E1enz, Aldo; Haiminen, Niina; Basu, Saugata; Parida, Laxmi","journal":"Algorithms for Computational Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9cd5d9c6a936f02c70d005b7f1c8403a565ac29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene expression data","topological data analysis approach","context of phenotype prediction","Parkinson\u2019s disease phenotype prediction","phenotype values","disease phenotype prediction task","standard machine learning methods","high dimensional data","intricate topological connections","study","sample-specific topological signatures","subtle signal","afflicted individuals","improved results","feature subsampling","RNA sequencing","useful indicator","presence","absence","condition","expressed genes","persistent homology","framework","goal"],"language":"en"},

However, such datasets are large in volume, and retrieving meaningful information from them is often challenging. Hence, different indexing techniques and data structures have been proposed to handle such a massive scale of data. We utilize one such technique: Generalized Suffix Tree (GST). In this paper, we introduce an efficient parallel generalized suffix tree construction algorithm that is scalable for arbitrary genomic datasets. Our construction mechanism employs shared and distributed memory architecture collectively while not posing any fixed, prior memory requirement as it uses external memory (disks). Our experimental results show that our proposed architecture offers around 4-times speedup with respect to the sequential algorithm with only 16 parallel processors. The experiments on different datasets and parameters also exhibit the scalability of the execution time. In addition, we utilize different string queries and demonstrate their execution time on such tree structure, illustrating the efficacy and usability of GST for genomic data.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aziz, Md Momin Al; Thulasiraman, Parimala; Mohammed, Noman","journal":"Algorithms for Computational Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74688307b68b51166c24837afd144caa61073922.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197101.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different datasets","data structures","arbitrary genomic datasets","abundance of usable genomic data","efficient parallel generalized suffix tree construction algorithm","tree structure","distributed memory architecture","external memory","execution time","proposed architecture","massive scale of data","prior memory requirement","different string queries","different indexing techniques","sequential algorithm","construction mechanism","parallel processors","usability of GST","times speedup","efficacy","unique insights","technological advancements","respect","volume","parameters","scalability","decade of digitization","addition","experimental results","experiments","meaningful information","well-being","paper","disks"],"language":"en"},

Most of existing recommendation methods exploit social influence by refining social relations into a scalar indicator to either directly recommend friends\u2019 visited items to users or constrain that friends\u2019 embeddings are similar. However, a scalar indicator cannot express the multifaceted interest correlations between users, since each user\u2019s interest is distributed across multiple dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a new embedding-based framework, which exploits users\u2019 multifaceted interest correlation for social recommendation. We design a dimension-wise attention mechanism to learn a correlation vector to characterize the interest correlation between a pair of friends, capturing the high variation of users\u2019 interest correlation on multiple dimensions. Moreover, we use friends\u2019 embeddings to smooth a user\u2019s own embedding with the correlation vector as weights, building the elaborate unstructured social influence between users.

One of the most crucial issues in SVD is coping with the scarcity of labeled vulnerabilities in projects that require the laborious manual labeling of code by software security experts. One possible solution is to employ deep domain adaptation (DA) which has recently witnessed enormous success in transferring learning from structural labeled to unlabeled data sources. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a technique that attempts to bridge the gap between source and target data in the joint space and emerges as a building block to develop deep DA approaches with state-of-the-art performance. However, deep DA approaches using the GAN principle to close the gap are subject to the mode collapsing problem that negatively impacts the predictive performance. Our aim in this paper is to propose Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) for tackling the problem of transfer learning from labeled to unlabeled software projects in SVD to resolve the mode collapsing problem faced in previous approaches. The experimental results on real-world software projects show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Van; Le, Trung; de Vel, Olivier; Montague, Paul; Grundy, John; Phung, Dinh","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8d72ea1d99c07cd1a99cebe3340ac433ca67fce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206170.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SVD","GAN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unlabeled software projects","software industry","real-world software projects","deep DA approaches","ubiquity of computer software","software security experts","SVD","deep domain adaptation","software vulnerability detection","important problem","problem of transfer learning","Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network","gap","previous approaches","computer security","mode","state-of-the-art performance","unlabeled data sources","scarcity of labeled vulnerabilities","Dual-GD","GAN principle","target data","state-of-the-art baselines","predictive performance","Generative adversarial network","method","building block","joint space","laborious manual","experimental results","DDAN","wide margin","enormous success","possible solution","paper","technique","crucial issues","aim"],"language":"en"},

Many efforts have been paid to provide accurate taxi demand prediction, and deep neural networks are leveraged recently. However, existing works are limited in properly incorporating multi-view taxi demand predictions together, by simply assigning fixed weights learned by training to the predictions of each region. To solve this problem, we apply the attention mechanism for leveraging contextual information to assist prediction, and a context-aware attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (CACRNN) is proposed. Specially, we forecast fine-grained taxi demands with considering multi-view features, including spatial correlations among adjacent regions, short-term periodicity, long-term periodicity, and impacts of external factors. Local convolutional (LC) layers and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are utilized to extract the features from historical records.

Current state-of-the-art models for brain tissue segmentation and disease classification require multiple modalities for training and inference. However, the acquisition of all of these modalities are expensive, time-consuming, inconvenient and the required modalities are often not available. As a result, these datasets contain large amounts of unpaired data, where examples in the dataset do not contain all modalities. On the other hand, there is smaller fraction of examples that contain all modalities (paired data) and furthermore each modality is high dimensional when compared to number of datapoints. In this work, we develop a method to address these issues with semi-supervised learning in translating between two neuroimaging modalities. Our proposed model, Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN (SSA-CGAN), uses an adversarial loss to learn from unpaired data points, cycle loss to enforce consistent reconstructions of the mappings and another adversarial loss to take advantage of paired data points. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework produces an improvement in reconstruction error and reduced variance for the pairwise translation of multiple modalities and is more robust to thermal noise when compared to existing methods.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Harrison; Luo, Simon; Ramos, Fabio","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01995645ac578db9dc5794cb11edb9fd3a92359b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206232.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206232/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["required modalities","neuroimaging modalities","translation of multiple modalities","form of different modalities","adversarial loss","unpaired data points","advantage of paired data points","Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN","cycle loss","large amounts of unpaired data","semi-supervised learning","proposed framework","proposed model","brain tissue segmentation","smaller fraction of examples","disease classification","improvement","T1","translating","reconstruction error","reduced variance","Current state-of-the-art models","SSA-CGAN","issues","consistent reconstructions","datasets","training","Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery","thermal noise","FLAIR","MRI","modality","mappings","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","wide range of neurological disorders","existing methods","result","inference","number of datapoints","hand","experiments","acquisition"],"language":"en"},

Hypotheses Generation) is a systematic knowledge discovery process that elicit novel inferences about previously unknown scientific knowledge by rationally connecting complementary and non-interactive literature. Prompt identification of such novel knowledge is beneficial not only for researchers but also for various other stakeholders such as universities, funding bodies and academic publishers. Almost all the prior LBD research suffer from two major limitations. Firstly, the over-reliance of domain-dependent resources which restrict the models\u2019 applicability to certain domains/problems. In this regard, we propose a generalisable LBD model that supports both cross-domain and cross-lingual knowledge discovery. The second persistent research deficiency is the mere focus of static snapshot of the corpus (i.e. ignoring the temporal evolution of topics) to detect the new knowledge. However, the knowledge in scientific literature changes dynamically and thus relying merely on static snapshot limits the model\u2019s ability in capturing semantically meaningful connections. As a result, we propose a novel temporal model that captures semantic change of topics using diachronic word embeddings to unravel more accurate connections. The model was evaluated using the largest available literature repository to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed cues towards recommending novel knowledge.

The exact parameters to recover the community structure of a SBM has been well studied, and many methods have been proposed to recover a nodes\u2019 community membership. A popular approach is to use spectral methods where the Graph Laplacian L of the given graph is created, and the Fiedler vector of the graph is found. This vector is then used to cluster nodes in the same community. While a robust method, it can be expensive to compute the Fiedler vector exactly. In this paper we examine the types of errors that can be tolerated using spectral methods while still recovering the communities. The two sources of error considered are: (i) dropping edges using different sparsification strategies; and (ii) inaccurately computing the eigenvectors. In this way, spectral clustering algorithms can be tuned to be far more efficient at detecting community structure for these community models.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laeuchli, Jesse","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ec3521b690eb62824c1f5ac1230b99d3654c424.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fiedler"],"organizations":["SBM","Graph Laplacian L"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["community structure","community models","spectral methods","nodes\u2019 community membership","Fiedler vector","Graph Laplacian","popular model","given graph","SBM","spectral clustering algorithms","popular approach","Stochastic Block Model","large graphs","edges","different sparsification strategies","way","exact parameters","types of errors","paper","robust method","communities","sources of error","eigenvectors"],"language":"en"},

The main objective of the present study was to develop a hybrid decision-making approach with geographic information systems to integrate spatial and non-spatial data to form a weighted result. This study involved three-tier analyses for assessing accessibility and selecting suitable sites for healthcare facilities, and analysing shortest-path network. The first tier of analysis stressed the spatial distance, density and proximity from existing healthcare to find more deprived and inaccessible areas in term of healthcare facilities. The result revealed that spatial discrepancy exists in the study area in term of access to healthcare facilities and for achieving equal healthcare access, it is essential to propose new plans. Thus, require finding suitable sites for put forward new healthcare service, which was highlighted in the second tier of analysis based on land use land cover, distancing to road and rail, proximity to residential areas, and weighted overlay of accessibility as decision factors. Finally, in the third tier of analysis, the most suitable site among the proposed healthcare was identified using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. The road network analysis was also performed in this study to determine the shortest and fastest route from these healthcare facilities to connect with district medical hospital. The present study found some suitable sites throughout the district on inaccessible zones where people are deprived from better healthcare facilities. This attempt will highly helpful for preparing a spatial decision support system which assists the health authorities regarding the healthcare services in inaccessible, underprivileged, and rural areas.

Previous experimental negotiation research mainly focused on the power of BATNA and the influence of the context on the negotiation outcome, raising the question as to whether BATNA is indeed the only relevant power lever in negotiations. Especially game theorists have shown that time-related costs have a decisive influence on negotiation outcomes. The study proposes a framework to actually measure and compare the relevance and force of different power levers in a simulated distributive buyer-seller negotiation. The results suggest that time pressure can be as influential as an alternative; however, students and professionals seem to react differently to power manipulations. Whereas the student sample was significantly influenced by time pressure but not by alternatives, the opposite could be observed in the professional group. The findings question the common belief that alternatives are the key driver of power in negotiations.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dahlen, Niklas; Eichst\u00E4dt, Tilman","journal":"Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b099c292e9547211f7d70c273f254956c0f6bbba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BATNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["power of BATNA","power manipulations","time pressure","negotiations","key driver of power","drivers of bargaining power","relevant power lever","negotiation outcomes","force of different power levers","time-related costs","question","study","Previous experimental negotiation research","role of best alternatives","simulated distributive buyer-seller negotiation","decisive influence","common belief","relevance","understanding","context","findings","professionals","game theorists","student sample","students","opposite","results","professional group","framework"],"language":"en"},

We find that the students who demonstrate leadership behaviors through their interactions score higher in extraversion and lower in conscientiousness than other students.

However, there appears to be a gap between these axiomatic studies and the actual determination of appropriate procedures, as an axiomatic characterization does not directly answer which axiom should be appropriate\u2014particularly when there is no agreement on the relative desirability of criteria. The present study proposes a formal model of procedural choice based on preferences over criteria (PCBPC). Specifically, we focus on the aggregation rule that maps a dichotomous preference profile over criteria for decision procedures to a nonempty set of decision procedures. We prove that the counting rule, which chooses the decision procedures with greatest supports, is the unique aggregation rule that satisfies anonymity (A), neutrality (N), strict monotonicity (SM), and partition consistency (PC), where PC is proposed based on the idea that representations of equivalent criteria in different ways should not affect the results. Two distinct standpoints for PCBPC are highlighted: one is to regard criteria as atomic, i.e., inseparable, objects and the other as composite, i.e., separable, objects. The difference between them is made explicit with two impossibility theorems showing the inconsistency between unanimity in the former standpoint and A (or PC) in the latter standpoint.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzuki, Takahiro; Horita, Masahide","journal":"Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc8e88f2f2eea74d6d00cb38ed9ababe0719be60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215189.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215189/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCBPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["axiomatic studies of decision procedures","nonempty set of decision procedures","representations of equivalent criteria","relative desirability of criteria","actual determination of appropriate procedures","unique aggregation rule","axiomatic characterization","counting rule","objects","PCBPC","formal model of procedural choice","dichotomous preference profile","greatest supports","SM","different ways","preferences","strict monotonicity","impossibility theorems","neutrality","inconsistency","unanimity","partition consistency","anonymity","idea","present study","composite","agreement","inseparable","results","distinct standpoints","lessons","gap","difference"],"language":"en"},

We propose to represent the heterogeneity in the composition of the metapopulations as layers in a multiplex network, where nodes would correspond to geographical areas and layers account for the mobility patterns of agents of the same class. We analyze classical epidemic models within this framework and obtain an excellent agreement with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. This agreement allows us to derive analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold and to face the challenge of characterizing a real multiplex metapopulation, the city of Medell\u00EDn in Colombia, where different recurrent mobility patterns are observed depending on the socioeconomic class of the agents. Our framework allows us to unveil the geographical location of those patches that trigger the epidemic state at the critical point. A careful exploration reveals that social mixing between classes and mobility crucially determines these critical patches and, more importantly, it can produce abrupt changes of the critical properties of the epidemic onset.","publish_time":"2018-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soriano-Pa\u00F1os, D.; Lotero, L.; Arenas, A.; G\u00F3mez-Garde\u00F1es, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a32fc38bd66c4e52129a6737a71cda68015a85f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Medell\u00EDn","Colombia"],"keyphrases":["mobility patterns of agents","different recurrent mobility patterns","epidemic threshold","epidemic state","epidemic onset","critical patches","heterogeneous agents","critical properties","critical point","classical epidemic models","theoretical framework","structured metapopulations","layers account","excellent agreement","multiplex network","geographical areas","geographical location","socioeconomic class","real multiplex metapopulation","Colombia","city of Medell\u00EDn","extensive Monte Carlo simulations","social mixing","study","processes","challenge","classes","nodes","analytical expressions","careful exploration","abrupt changes","composition","heterogeneity"],"language":"en"},

In response, we point to the value of live, place-based debate in HE institutions to highlight distributional inequity, raise local voices and connect these with national policy. Yet even as we compiled this article about HE debate, the Covid-19 pandemic took hold globally, cancelling face-to-face meetings, by necessity. We therefore draw on a postdigital perspective, as we share our individual dialogues in support of debate, via collective writing, against this new backdrop of social distancing and widespread uncertainty. We may not currently be able to convene our Midlands HE Policy Network (MHEPN) debates in person, but we can voice the essential part that regional universities play in connecting global technological and biological change, with local social projects, citizens and industry. Postdigital theory offers one route to understanding that Covid-19 does not sit apart from other political economic challenges in HE and beyond, that we need to debate simultaneously.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayes, Sarah; Jopling, Michael; Hayes, Dennis; Westwood, Andy; Tuckett, Alan; Barnett, Ronald","journal":"Postdigit Sci Educ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/719c814e3340ad996f04221cdddfc090cab4a7b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7220570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK Higher Education","Midlands HE Policy Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Policy Network","support of debate","local voices","regional universities","regional voices","place-based debate","Covid","generic structure of national policy frameworks","local social projects","Postdigital theory","postdigital perspective","new backdrop of social distancing","institutional history","purpose","biological change","data-driven measures of excellence","risks","MHEPN","institutions","collective writing","widespread uncertainty","distributional inequity","UK Higher Education","innovative practices","hold","value of live","Midlands","debates","citizens","industry","face-to-face meetings","agnostic discourse","individual dialogues","person","agendas","pandemic","route","political economic challenges","necessity","entrenched inequalities","response","article"],"language":"en"},

During surgery, in cases with advanced stage biliary tract tumors that cannot be performed hepatectomy, after aggressive dissections to provide a negative surgical margin, a large number of segmental bile ducts can be revealed and needs to ensure the continuity of bile flow. Here, our clinical series of portoenterostomy (PE) in which we applied in patients who had aggressive hilar dissection and resection for hilar cholangiocarcinomas and biliary tract tumors were discussed. The study included 15 patients who underwent PE for biliary tract tumors and hilar cholangiocarcinomas between 2015 and 2019. Six of the patients had a tumor-negative surgical margin, with a mean follow-up of 14.4 months (range 2 to 28 months). Nine of the patients had a tumor-positive surgical margin, with a mean follow-up of 7.7 months (range 2 to 17 months). Portoenterostomy instead of hepaticojejunostomy in small and multiple biliary radicles and bile duct cancers has been successfully performed in 15 patients of bile duct cancer and Klatskin tumor.

Furthermore, there is a lack of expert healthcare professional involvement in app development. To avoid harm, it is critical that the scientific accuracy, patient privacy, and user safety of urology mHealth applications are assured. This is because there is no globally enforced medical app regulation, compulsory scientific guidelines, nor mandatory industry standards. Urologists, either individually or via scientific organizations, should have a pivotal position in the design, development, review, certification, and recommendation of apps. mHealth holds great potential in urology, as it can aid multiple stakeholders: citizens, patients, healthcare professionals, health organizations, and public authorities (e.g., Ministry of Health).

The resulting FIP virus (FIPV) commonly causes central nervous system (CNS) and ocular pathology in cases of noneffusive disease. Over 95% of cats with FIP will succumb to disease in days to months after diagnosis despite a variety of historically used treatments. Recently developed antiviral drugs have shown promise in treatment of nonneurological FIP, but data from neurological FIP cases are limited. Four cases of naturally occurring FIP with CNS involvement were treated with the antiviral nucleoside analogue GS-441524 (5-10 mg/kg) for at least 12 weeks. Cats were monitored serially with physical, neurologic, and ophthalmic examinations. One cat had serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (including feline coronavirus [FCoV]) titers and FCoV reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR) and serial ocular imaging using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). All cats had a positive response to treatment. Three cats are alive off treatment (528, 516, and 354 days after treatment initiation) with normal physical and neurologic examinations. One cat was euthanized 216 days after treatment initiation following relapses after primary and secondary treatment.

Methods 125 COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were classified into mild (93 cases) and severe (32 cases) groups, basing on their 3 to 7-days clinical outcomes. Patients\u0027 gender, age, comorbid with underlying diseases, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and subsequently analyzed with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods. Finally, we evaluate their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results Seventeen factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups. Next, only four factors, including the comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (\u003E24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP \u003E10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH \u003E250U/liter), were found to be independently associated with the later disease development. Prognostic value analysis by ROC indicated that individual factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia, but that the combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increase the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). Three- or four-factors combinations, including elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, further increased the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission could independently predict the severe illness occurrence. Conclusions General clinical characteristics and laboratory tests, such as combinations consisting of elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, and detectable viral RNA in serum post-admission could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Huang; Cai, Shuijiang; Li, Yueping; Li, Youxia; Fan, Yinqiang; Li, Linghua; Lei, Chunliang; Tang, Xiaoping; Hu, Fengyu; Li, Feng; Deng, Xilong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daf177bb1a73a9e8c509e49b87af84c4f81bba1b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROC","LDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elevated LDH","severe groups","occurrence of severe pneumonia","potential severe COVID","combination of fast respiratory rate","Prognostic value analysis","severe illness occurrence","factors combinations","pneumonia patients","serum post-admission","prognostic values","individual factors","high confident prognostic value","measurable serum viral RNA post-admission","underlying diseases","clinical manifestations","laboratory tests","ROC","cases","liter","elevated C-reactive protein","detectable viral RNA","days clinical outcomes","Conclusions General clinical characteristics","multivariate logistic regression methods","epidemiological history","characteristic curve","CRP","receiver","age","single-factor","predictive confidence","lactate dehydrogenase","Patients\u0027 gender","sensitivity","AUC","later disease development","study","Results","specificity","Background"],"language":"en"},

By analyzing 106 SARS-CoV-2 and 39 SARS genome sequences, we provided direct genetic evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than SARS. Minimum Evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative original status of SARS-CoV-2 and the early-stage spread history. The discrepant phylogenies for the spike protein and its receptor binding domain proved a previously reported structural rearrangement prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Despite that we found the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is particularly more conserved, we identified a mutation that leads to weaker receptor binding capability, which concerns a SARS-CoV-2 sample collected on 27th January 2020 from India. This represents the first report of a significant SARS-CoV-2 mutant, and raises the alarm that the ongoing vaccine development may become futile in future epidemic if more mutations were identified. Highlights Based on the currently available genome sequence data, we proved that SARS-COV-2 genome has a much lower mutation rate and genetic diversity than SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak. The spike (S) protein encoding gene of SARS-COV-2 is found relatively more conserved than other protein-encoding genes, which is a good indication for the ongoing antiviral drug and vaccine development.

Elucidating the diagnostic value of different methods, especially the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection is helpful for improving the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, providing timely treatment, and differentiating the infected cases from the healthy, thus preventing further epidemics. Methods: Medical records from 38 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Second People\u0027s Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Specimens including throat swabs, sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period, viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured respectively. The detectability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. Results: Among 38 patients, the total seropositive rate for IgM and IgG was 50.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Two patients remained seronegative throughout the course of illness. In the early phase of illness, the RNA test for sputum specimens possessed the highest detectability(92.3%), followed by the the RNA test for throat swabs (69.2%), and the antibodies assays presented lower positive rates(IgM, 23.0%, IgG, 53.8%). While, the sensitivity of antibodies assays overtook that of RNA test since day 8 after onset (IgM, 50.0%; IgG, 87.5%). Of note, the positive rate of throat swabs was only 13.0% for cases in later phase(\u226515 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG rose to 52.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Combined use of antibodies assay and qRT-PCR at the same time was able to improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, especially for the throat swabs group at the later stage of illness. Moreover, most of these cases with undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness were able to be IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days. Conclusions: The antibodies detection against SARS-CoV-2 offers vital clinical information for physicians, and could be used as an effective supplementary indicator for suspected cases of negative viral nucleic acid detection or in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of suspected cases.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Yong; Yuan, Yi; Li, Tuan Tuan; Wang, Wu Xiao; Li, Yong Xiu; Li, Ang; Han, Feng Ming","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dbd5520b71aae8af4f31fee2d4a7db593a138e2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20042044","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgM/IgG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum IgM-IgG antibodies","antibodies detection","sensitivities of IgM","throat swabs specimens","confirmed SARS-CoV","auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies test","auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays","diagnosis of suspected cases","RNA test","IgG seropositive","sensitivity of antibodies assays","throat swabs group","positive rate of throat swabs","infected cases","patients","infection","undetectable viral RNA","early stage of illness","later stage of illness","early phase of illness","suspected cases of negative viral nucleic acid detection","sputum specimens","Combined use of antibodies assay","sensitivities of pathogenic","course of illness","detectability of different methods","diagnostic value of different methods","viral RNAs","later phase","total seropositive rate","highest detectability","lower positive rates","conjunction","qRT-PCR","hospitalization period","effective supplementary indicator","timely treatment","Medical records","novel coronavirus","vital clinical information","countries","spread","onset","physicians","note","days","Conclusions","People\u0027s Hospital of Fuyang","pandemic proportions","matter of weeks","Background","nCoV","epidemics","Results"],"language":"en"},

Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection uses the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual\u0027s genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population biobank, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of ARBs combination therapies (p=5.7x10-4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff=0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10-4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

It provides scholars with a roadmap for understanding where the field has been and where it might go in the future. In particular, this analysis details the venues in which knowledge syntheses are published, the types of syntheses conducted, citation rates they produce, and altmetric attention they garner. Method In 2020, the authors conducted a bibliometric analysis of knowledge syntheses published in 14 core medical education journals from 1999 to 2019. To characterize the studies, metadata was extracted from Pubmed, Web of Science, Altmetrics Explorer, and Unpaywall. Results The authors analyzed 963 knowledge syntheses representing 3.1% of total articles published (n=30,597). On average, 45.9 knowledge syntheses were published annually (SD=35.85, Median=33), and there was an overall 2,620% increase in the number of knowledge syntheses published from 1999 to 2019. The journals each published, on average, a total of 68.8 knowledge syntheses (SD=67.2, Median=41) with Medical Education publishing the most (n=189; 19%). Twenty-one knowledge synthesis types were identified; the most prevalent types were systematic reviews (n=341; 35.4%) and scoping reviews (n=88; 9.1%). Knowledge syntheses were cited an average of 53.80 times (SD=107.12, Median=19) and received a mean Altmetric Attention Score of 14.12 (SD=37.59, Median=6). Conclusions There has been considerable growth in knowledge syntheses in medical education over the past 20 years, contributing to medical education\u2019s evidence base. Beyond this increase in volume, researchers have introduced methodological diversity in these publications, and the community has taken to social media to share knowledge syntheses. Implications for the field, including the impact of synthesis types and their relationship to knowledge translation, are discussed.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maggio, Lauren A.; Costello, Joseph A.; Norton, Candace; Driessen, Erik W.; Artino, Anthony R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c087935ceb89fc3b363caab6823f87366dd1fcad.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.088542","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medical Education","Altmetric Attention Score"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["landscape of knowledge syntheses","number of knowledge syntheses","types of syntheses","bibliometric analysis of knowledge syntheses","knowledge translation","knowledge synthesis types","SD","Median","core medical education journals","average","prevalent types","impact of synthesis types","medical education\u2019s evidence base","increase","authors","field","total articles","mean Altmetric Attention Score","systematic reviews","scoping reviews","years","considerable growth","Pubmed","Web of Science","relationship","Altmetrics Explorer","citation rates","methodological diversity","volume","researchers","social media","venues","publications","metadata","community","Unpaywall","times","studies","Conclusions","roadmap","scholars","Implications","future"],"language":"en"},

Method: We performed probability calculations to estimate COVID-19 infection status and likelihood of disease transmission among neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients and health care workers during anti-VEGF procedures, at various community prevalence levels of COVID-19. We then applied the expected burden of COVID-19 illness and death expressed through health-adjusted life-years (HALYs) lost. We compared these results to the expected disease burden of severe visual impairment if sight protecting anti-VEGF injections were not performed. Results: Our calculations estimate for a single treatment, where the background rate of COVID-19 in the community is 1000 active cases per million population, and full personal protective equipment (PPE) is available, that the benefits of treatment are greater than the expected harms to the patient and immediate health care team, provided the probability of severe visual impairment without treatment is \u003E0.001%. Without effective PPE, and with a COVID-19 prevalence of 200,000 per million, an 8.5% chance of severe visual impairment could still justify monthly injections for six months. Conclusion: In most cases analysed, the reduced disease burden from avoiding visual impairment outweighs the expected HALYs lost from COVID-19 transmission. This finding is driven by the fact that HALYs lost when someone suffers severe visual impairment for 5 years are equivalent to nearly 400 moderate cases of infectious disease lasting 2 weeks each.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyd, M.

Additionally, we revealed a general dependence of the C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene, MTHFD1, for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human cells. MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton potently blocked replication of several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50, 2 uM) was \u003E35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Method: Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 ug/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Results: Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC50, even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose.

Since the most effective antiviral approaches are usually based on combined therapies that tackle the viral life cycle at different stages, we are also testing combinations of drugs that may be critical to reduce the emergence of resistant viruses. We will provide results as soon as they become available, so data should be interpreted with caution, clearly understanding the limitations of the in vitro model, that may not always reflect what could happen in vivo. Thus, our goal is to test the most active antivirals identified in adequate animal models infected with SARS-CoV-2, to add more information about possible in vivo efficacy. In turn, successful antivirals could be tested in clinical trials as treatments for infected patients, but also as pre-exposure prophylaxis to avoid novel infections until an effective and safe vaccine is developed.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodon, Jordi; Noguera-Julian, Marc; Erkizia, Itziar; Valencia, Alfonso; Guallar, V\u00EDctor; Carrillo, Jorge; Blanco, Juli\u00E0; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim; Clotet, Bonaventura; Vergara-Alert, J\u00FAlia; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/950358fe49934a81835772654a7ff7327efbc177.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.055756","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","clinical management of SARS","forthcoming clinical trials","available drugs","Different treatments","goal","efficacy","effective antiviral approaches","active antivirals","different stages","antiviral activity","successful antivirals","infected patients","combinations of drugs","ongoing results","novel infections","solid evidence-driven rationale","viral life cycle","adequate animal models","pre-exposure prophylaxis","combined therapies","safe vaccine","variety of diseases","emergence of resistant viruses","limitations","caution","information","data","turn","cytopathic effect"],"language":"en"},

We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin. Methods: New user cohort studies were conducted including 16 severe adverse events (SAEs). Rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 18\u002B and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days. Self-controlled case series (SCCS) were conducted to further establish safety in wider populations. Separately, SAEs associated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (compared to hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (CalHRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where I2\u003C40%. Results: Overall, 956,374 and 310,350 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 323,122 and 351,956 users of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin were included. No excess risk of SAEs was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. SCCS confirmed these findings. However, when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine, we observed an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (CalHR2.19 [1.22-3.94]), chest pain/angina (CalHR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (CalHR 1.22 [95% CI 1.02-1.45]) Conclusions: Short-term hydroxychloroquine treatment is safe, but addition of azithromycin may induce heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, potentially due to synergistic effects on QT length.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism. Importance Virus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xuesen; Zheng, Shuangli; Chen, Danying; Zheng, Mei; Li, Xinglin; Li, Guoli; Lin, Hanxin; Chang, Jinhong; Zeng, Hui; Guo, Ju-Tao","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f9de20285995c448b06f41c735b3f3519b4dfcc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.021469","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GILT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of HCoV","entry of human coronaviruses","overexpression of LY6E","Identification of LY6E","effect of LY6E","infection of HCoV","human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection","Importance Virus entry","human immunodeficiency virus","host cells","infectious entry","knockdown of LY6E expression","ectopic expression of LY6E","IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry","immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection","HepG2 cells","increased efficiency of virus entry","C3A cells","biological function of LY6E","CoV infection","human pathogenic viruses","known activity of interfering virus entry","host cellular protein","A549 cells","GILT","host factors","ADAP2","sub-clone of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line","yellow fever virus","cell lines","cell tropism","interferon inducible cellular proteins","key determinants of host range","potent restriction factor of coronaviruses","envelope spike proteins","differential susceptibility","variety of viruses","adaptive immune responses","pandemic SARS-CoV","critical antiviral immune effector","overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2","influenza","amphotericin treatment","sheds new light","IFITMs","strong contact inhibition of growth","higher levels","decade","control","HEK","Functional analyses","distinct mechanism","effort","work"],"language":"en"},

When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient\u0027s CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of Novaferon in vitro, and conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to explore the antiviral effects of Novaferon for COVID-19. Methods In laboratory, the inhibition of Novaferon on viral replication in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and on SARS-CoV-2 entry into healthy cells was determined. Antiviral effects of Novaferon were evaluated in COVID-19 patients with treatment of Novaferon, Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The primary endpoint was the SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 of treatment, and the secondary endpoint was the time to the SARS-CoV-2 clearance in COVID-19 patients Results Novaferon inhibited the viral replication in infected cells (EC50=1.02 ng/ml), and protected healthy cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection (EC50=0.1 ng/ml). Results from the 89 enrolled COVID-19 patients showed that both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 than the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (50.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0400, and 60.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0053). Median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 6 days, 6 days, and 9 days for three groups respectively, suggesting a 3-dayreduction of time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups compared with Lopinavir/Ritonavir group. Conclusions Novaferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro and in COVID-19 patients. These data justified the further evaluation of Novaferon.

Pressing relevance stems from the need to restart the economy dramatically affected by the lockdown. We employ a spatially explicit, data-intensive model of the patterns of disease spread in Italy, with the goal of providing tools to: estimate the baseline trajectory, i.e. the expected unfolding of the outbreak if the current containment measures were kept in place indefinitely; assess possible deviations from the baseline, should relaxations of the current lockdown result in increased disease transmission; and estimate the isolation effort required to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak. For instance, a 50% increase in effective transmission as a result of the loosening of confinement measures, to be instated on May 4, yields an epidemic curve that shows a major rebound larger than the previous peaks in most regions. A control effort, capable of isolating a daily percentage of approximately 7% of the individuals in the exposed and pre-symptomatic stages, proves necessary to counterbalance such an increase, and maintain the epidemic curve onto the decreasing baseline trajectory. We explore several scenarios, provide the basic data to design the related control strategies and discuss their feasibility. Should suitable control via tracing and testing prove unfeasible, stop-and-go enforcement or delay of the lockdown relaxations would be necessary to reduce the isolation effort required to maintain the epidemic trajectory under control.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bertuzzo, E.; Mari, L.; Pasetto, D.; Miccoli, S.; Casagrandi, R.; Gatto, M.; Rinaldo, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18aacfe07a9f1ea7bab082650272153085db8236.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20083568v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control effort","lockdown relaxations","epidemic trajectory","current lockdown result","current containment measures","epidemic curve","isolation effort","suitable control","decreasing baseline trajectory","design of selective relaxations","related control strategies","Italy","outbreak","increased disease transmission","loosening of confinement measures","patterns of disease","effective transmission","basic data","data-intensive model","spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","previous peaks","place","pre-symptomatic stages","appropriate methodological choices","SARS-CoV","expected unfolding","tracing","testing","possible deviations","need","individuals","feasibility","tools","enforcement","delay","resurgence","daily percentage","relevance stems","regions","goal","scenarios","economy","instance"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age \u003C20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chaolong; Liu, Li; Hao, Xingjie; Guo, Huan; Wang, Qi; Huang, Jiao; He, Na; Yu, Hongjie; Lin, Xihong; Pan, An; Wei, Sheng; Wu, Tangchun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9701a8c529cd8c18124da4cd61c1165a64b50281.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["impact of interventions","post interventions","age groups","Wuhan","infected cases","Covid","epidemic","impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions","Estimation of unascertained cases","median age","mild-symptomatic cases","Healthcare workers","children","periods","outbreak","higher attack rates","elderly people","epidemiological characteristics","epidemiological features","coronavirus disease","different demographic groups","municipal Notifiable Disease Report System","important implications","severity risk","continuing surveillance","vulnerable populations","laboratory","sex","geographic regions","METHODS Individual-level data","years","CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures","Special efforts","effective reproductive number","BACKGROUND","model","key events","China","credible interval","women","infections"],"language":"en"},

The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C\u003ET (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C\u003ET, 14408C\u003ET, and 23403A\u003EG. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons\u2019 travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target. Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins. With the limited number of sequences this was the only frequent novel non-synonymous change observed from Indian strains, thereby making this change vulnerable for investigation in future.

In this work, we study the characteristics of automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work for the current pandemic. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequately sample the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold.

There are however some countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient salinity. METHOD: PM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity. RESULTS: One month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4 - 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6 - 79.8) (p\u003C0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically significant. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 - 617mgCl/m2/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19 rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl/m2/TAG) (p\u003C0.003). CONCLUSION: High levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.

On January 21, 2020, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center and the WHO released its first situation report about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sparking significant media attention. How Twitter content and sentiment has evolved in the early stages of any outbreak, including the COVID-19 epidemic, has not been described. Objective: To quantify and understand early changes in Twitter activity, content, and sentiment about the COVID-19 epidemic. Design: Observational study. Setting: Twitter platform. Participants: All Twitter users who created or sent a message from January 14th to 28th, 2020. Measurements: We extracted tweets matching hashtags related to COVID-19 and measured frequency of keywords related to infection prevention practices, vaccination, and racial prejudice. We performed a sentiment analysis to identify emotional valence and predominant emotions. We conducted topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. Results: We evaluated 126,049 tweets from 53,196 unique users. The hourly number of COVID-19-related tweets starkly increased from January 21, 2020 onward. Nearly half (49.5%) of all tweets expressed fear and nearly 30% expressed surprise. The frequency of racially charged tweets closely paralleled the number of newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19. The economic and political impact of the COVID-19 was the most commonly discussed topic, while public health risk and prevention were among the least discussed. Conclusion: Tweets with negative sentiment and emotion parallel the incidence of cases for the COVID-19 outbreak. Twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to understand public sentiment in real-time and target public health messages based on user interest and emotion.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Medford, Richard J.; Saleh, Sameh N.; Sumarsono, Andrew; Perl, Trish M.; Lehmann, Christoph U.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d9d513cec6b87c5b9c00215261e00ca946648a5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052936","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","Emergency Operations Center","WHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related tweets","public sentiment","Twitter content","Twitter users","diagnosed cases of COVID","hourly number of COVID","Twitter activity","Twitter platform","negative sentiment","sentiment analysis","public health messages","public health risk","health information","discussed topic","outbreak","early changes","incidence of cases","early stages","topic modeling","unique users","infection prevention practices","measured frequency of keywords","vaccination","emotional valence","coronavirus disease","trends","predominant emotions","discussion topics","racial prejudice","situation report","viral epidemics","CDC","Emergency Operations Center","political impact","Conclusion","hashtags","significant media attention","Design","Observational study","fear","Setting","rich medium","Measurements","Participants","surprise","Objective","Background","Results"],"language":"en"},

Countries need rapid data on the prevalence of the virus in communities to enable rapid containment. However, the equipment, human and laboratory resources required for conducting individual RT-PCR is prohibitive. One technique to reduce the number of tests required is the pooling of samples for analysis by RT-PCR prior to testing. Methods: We conducted a mathematical analysis of pooling strategies for infection rate classification using group testing and for the identification of individuals by testing pooled clusters of samples. Findings: On the basis of the proposed pooled testing strategy we calculate the probability of false alarm, the probability of detection, and the average number of tests required as a function of the pool size. We find that when the sample size is 256, with a maximum pool size of 64, with only 7.3 tests on the average, we can distinguish between prevalences of 1% and 5% with a probability of detection of 95% and probability of false alarm of 4%. Interpretation: The pooling of RT-PCR samples is a cost-effective technique for providing much-needed course-grained data on the prevalence of COVID-19. This is a powerful tool in providing countries with information that can facilitate a response to the pandemic that is evidence-based and saves the most lives possible with the resources available.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narayanan, Krishna; Frost, Isabel; Heidarzadeh, Anoosheh; Tseng, Katie K; Banerjee, Sayantan; John, Jacob; Laxminarayan, Ramanan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9844f67f10c860b4525c462b9d8f13f3f6b3290d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051995","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["pooling of RT","pooling of samples","PCR samples","probability of detection","probability of false alarm","group testing","individual RT-PCR","average number of tests","pooled clusters of samples","proposed pooled testing strategy","prevalence of COVID","rapid data","Countries","maximum pool size","sample size","pandemic","mathematical analysis of pooling strategies","laboratory resources","cost-effective technique","resources available","rapid containment","course-grained data","infection rate classification","basis","virus","identification of individuals","information","communities","function","response","powerful tool","equipment","evidence","Methods","Interpretation","Findings","Background","China","prevalences"],"language":"en"},

Results Among 654 participants (413 [64.8%] female, age 40.14 [15.23] years), 28.7% were defined as non-adherents. Non-adherence was associated with male gender [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.54, CI 1.03-2.31], having children [aOR = 1.73, 1.13-2.65], smoking [aOR = 2.27, CI 1.42-3.62], high levels of ADHD symptoms [aOR = 1.55, CI 1.07-.25], high levels of past risk-taking behavior [aOR = 1.41, CI 1.10-1.81], as well as by current high psychological distress [aOR = 1.51, CI 1.14-2.01], low perceived risk of COVID-19 [aOR = 1.52, CI 1.22-1.89], low exposure to the instructions [aOR = 1.45, CI 1.14-1.82], and low perceived efficacy of the instructions [aOR = 1.47, CI 1.16-1.85]. Adjusted OR of age, economic status, physical health status, and exposure to media did not reach the significance level. Conclusions and Relevance People with the above characteristics may have increased risk for non-adherence to public health instructions. There appears to be a need for setting out and communicating instructions to specifically targeted at-risk populations.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pollak, Y.; Dayan, H.; Shoham, R.; Berger, I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20076620v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CI","Relevance People"],"locations":["Israel"],"keyphrases":["aOR","health-related","risk-related","public health instructions","medical instructions","Measure Non-adherence","adherence scale","instruction-related factors","instruction-related characteristics","minutes health","risk factors","low perceived risk of COVID","physical health status","increased risk","non-adherents","Participants","low exposure","economic status","instruction items","low perceived efficacy","age","high levels of ADHD symptoms","high levels of past risk-taking behavior","current high psychological distress","economic impacts","Exposures Sociodemographic","online survey","adjusted odds ratio","Design Crossminussectional survey","male gender","pandemicprime","media","Main Outcome","rate of transmission","convenience sample","Israel","Relevance People","targeted at-risk populations","Importance","mean score","Population-based study","Conclusions","significance level","Objective","smoking","female","years","Results","need","children"],"language":"en"},

This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computationally efficiency is such that it be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sturniolo, S.; Waites, W.; Colbourn, T.; Manheim, D.; Panovska-Griffiths, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/485d4c8b8ed84a3fddc06be964fe7b4ea423f00c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101808v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact-Tracing","contact tracing strategies","effects of testing","SEIR models","individual-based models","standard compartmental models","required levels of testing","isolation","individual level","mechanistic agent-based model","resultant SEIR-TTI model","application of agent","exploratory modelling","new method","population level","Existing compartmental mathematical modelling methods","epidemics","behaviour","careful probabilistic argument","adaptive planning","aggregate","ABMs","disease outbreaks","practice","computational cost","interventions","alternative","paper","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

At the time of writing this manuscript, the unprecedented public health crisis caused more than 2.5 million cases with a mortality range of 5-7%. The SARS-CoV-2, also called novel Coronavirus, is related to both SARS-CoV and bat SARS. Great efforts have been spent to control the pandemic that has become a significant burden on the health systems in a short time. Since the emergence of the crisis, a great number of researchers started to use the AI tools to identify drugs, diagnosing using CT scan images, scanning body temperature, and classifying the severity of the disease. The emergence of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a challenging problem with expected serious consequences on the management of the disease. Here, we introduce COVIDier, a deep learning-based software that is enabled to classify the different genomes of Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV. COVIDier was trained on 1925 genomes, belonging to the three families of SARS retrieved from NCBI Database to propose a new method to train deep learning model trained on genome data using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), a deep learning algorithm, that could blindly predict the virus family name from the genome of by predicting the statistically similar genome from training data to the given genome.

In Europe, Germany is currently one of the most affected countries. In March 2020, a \u0022lockdown\u0022 was established to contain the virus spread, including the closure of schools and child day care facilities as well as forced social distancing and bans of any public gathering. The present study attempts to analyze whether these governmental interventions had an impact on the declared aim of \u0022flattening the curve\u0022, referring to the epidemic curve of new infections. This analysis is conducted from a regional perspective. On the level of the 412 German counties, logistic growth models were estimated based on reported cases of infections, aiming at determining the regional growth rate of infections and the point of inflection where infection rates begin to decrease and the curve flattens. All German counties exceeded the peak of new infections between the beginning of March and the middle of April. In a large majority of German counties, the epidemic curve has flattened before the social ban was established (March 23). In a minority of counties, the peak was already exceeded before school closures. The growth rates of infections vary spatially depending on the time the virus emerged. Counties belonging to states which established an additional curfew show no significant improvement with respect to growth rates and mortality. On the contrary, growth rates and mortality are significantly higher in Bavaria compared to whole Germany. The results raise the question whether social ban measures and curfews really contributed to the curve flattening. Furthermore, mortality varies strongly across German counties, which can be attributed to infections of people belonging to the \u0022risk group\u0022, especially residents of retirement homes.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wieland, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c3fdba6c36a829d40a71b3aabf209612ada18b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101667v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Bavaria","Germany"],"keyphrases":["growth rates of infections","epidemic curve of new infections","regional growth rate of infections","infections of people","minority of counties","curve flattening","peak of new infections","large majority of German counties","mortality","reported cases of infections","infection rates","logistic growth models","social distancing","social ban measures","Germany","regional perspective","significant improvement","curfews","respect","child day care facilities","closure of schools","question","point of inflection","additional curfew","novel coronavirus","impact","SARS-CoV","corresponding respiratory disease COVID","beginning","risk group","declared aim","residents of retirement homes","governmental interventions","states","Bavaria","results","public gathering","emerging","analysis","school closures","time","level","present study","affected countries","middle","Europe","world","lockdown"],"language":"en"},

Objective: To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive. Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital: No. IRBID: TJ-20200320) Setting: A database of outpatients in Tongji Hospital (University Hospital) from 15 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. Patients: 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19 Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS-CoV-2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive. Results: Of the 1,324 outpatients who diagnosed of COVID-19, 633 patients tested positive in their first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (47.8%), with a mean age of 51 years (SD=14.9); the rest, which had a mean age of 47 years (SD=15.4), tested negative in the first test. Ground glass opacity in a CT imaging report was associated with a lower chance of false negatives (aOR, 0.56), and reduced the length of time window for testing positive by 26%. Consolidation was associated with a higher chance of false negatives (aOR, 1.57), and extended the length of time window for testing positive by 44%. In blood routine tests, basophils (aOR, 1.28) and eosinophils (aOR, 1.29) were associated with a higher chance of false negatives, and were found to extend the time window for testing positive by 23% and 41%, respectively. Age and gender also affected the significantly. Limitation: Data were generated in a large single-center study. Conclusion: Testing outcome and positive window of SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 patients were associated with CT imaging results, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms. Taking into account relevant information in CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms helped reduce a false negative testing outcome. The predictive AFT model, what we believe to be one of the first statistical models for predicting time window of SARS-CoV-2 detection, could help clinicians improve the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis, and hence, optimizes the timing of nucleic acid detection and alleviates the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits around the world.

However, the effectiveness of these drugs in large populations is unclear. Subjects and Methods: As of May 2020, data analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Review and Assessment Service database in Korea. Using the COVID-19 and claims data of the past 5 years, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Results: Totally, data of 67850 subjects were accessible. Of these, 5080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP-4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died.

In this work, we present a droplet qRT-PCR assay for quantifying influenza A virus (IAV) following systematic testing of different PCR additives, resulting in the optimal combination of Tween-20 / BSA / betaine to maintain drop stability and limit dye diffusion. We use a standard qPCR machine to generate real time amplification curves of hundreds of thousands of drops and correlate this data with constructed amplification curves obtained from hundreds of drops sampled at various cycle numbers and imaged using epifluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we tested a range of in vitro transcribed M gene and IAV viral supernatant from infected cells. We directly amplified IAV genomes from infected supernatant without an RNA extraction step.

We performed genome-wide screens in human cells with chloroquine and several other widely used cationic amphipathic drugs (CADs) including the anti-depressants, sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac), the analgesic nortriptyline (Pamelor), the anti-arrhythmic amiodarone (Cordarone), and the anti-hypertensive verapamil (Calan) to characterize their molecular similarities and differences. Despite CADs having different disease indications but consistent with them sharing key chemical properties, we found CADs to have remarkably similar phenotypic profiles compared with non-CADs we and others have previously screened (1\u20135). The most significant genetic interaction for all CADs was the initiating step in sphingolipid biosynthesis catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). A comparison of genome-wide screens performed with diverse pathogens from viruses, bacteria, plants, and parasites including Ebola (6), adeno-associated virus AAV2 (7), HIV (8), Rotavirus (9), Influenza A (10), Zika virus (11), Picornavirus (12), Exotoxin A (13), Cholera toxin (14), Type III secretion system and Shiga toxin (15, 16), Ricin toxin (17), and Toxoplasma gondii (18) showed SPT as a top common host factor and 80% overlap overall in top hits specifically with CADs. Potential sphingolipid-mediated mechanisms for the host response- and virulence-modulating effects of CADs involve autophagy and SERPINE1/PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Chloroquine has recently shown potential as an anti-viral agent for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease (19, 20). Our study demonstrates that numerous readily available drugs molecularly function highly similar to chloroquine, which suggests they might be considered for further pre-clinical investigation in the context of SARS-CoV-2. More generally, our work suggests the diverse pathogen mitigating potential of drugs that inhibit host sphingolipid biosynthesis such as CADs.

In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the course of the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. Since March 16, the Italian COVID-19 outbreak has entered a new phase, with the northern and southern regions following different trajectories. As a result, our adjusted CFR has been increasing between March 16 and March 20.

ABSTRACT Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a reorganization of healthcare systems and an exceptional saturation of their resources. In this context, it is vital to ensure acute stroke care and optimize the care processes of the stroke code to reduce the risk of contagion and rationalize the use of hospital resources. To do this, the Ictus Madrid multidisciplinary group proposes a series of recommendations. Methods: Non-systematic bibliographic review of the available publications with the terms \u201Cstroke\u201D and \u201Ccovid-19\u201D or \u201Ccoronavirus\u201D or \u201CSARS-COV-2\u201D, as well as other already known for the authors. We provide a document of recommendations as a result of the consensus of the Ictus Madrid multidisciplinary group and its Neurology Committee. Results: Our recommendations are structured on five lines: (1) Coordinate to guarantee the access to hospital care for stroke patients, (2) Recognize potentially COVID-19 infected stroke patients, (3) Organize to ensure the protection of healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infections, (4) Neuroimaging and other procedures potentially associated to risks for COVID-19 infection should be reduced and secured to avoid contagion, and (5) At home as soon as possible and supported follow-up to optimize hospital occupancy. The procedure is shown summarized under the acronym CORONA (Coordinate, Recognize, Organize, Neuroimaging, At home). Conclusions: These recommendations can support the organization of healthcare services for acute stroke care and the optimization of their resources, guaranteeing the protection of healthcare professionals.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodr\u00EDguez-Pardo, Jorge; Fuentes, Blanca; de Leci\u00F1ana, Mar\u00EDa Alonso; Campollo, Jorge; Casta\u00F1o, Patricia Calleja; Ruiz, Joaqu\u00EDn Carneado; Egido Herrero, Jos\u00E9; Leal, Roberto Garc\u00EDa; N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Antonio Gil; Cerezo, Jorge Francisco G\u00F3mez; Mart\u00EDnez, Alfonso Mart\u00EDn; Vallejo, Jaime Masjuan; Aguado, Blanca Palomino; L\u00F3pez, Nicol\u00E1s Riera; de las Heras, Rogelio Sim\u00F3n; Vivancos Mora, Jos\u00E9; Tejedor, Exuperio D\u00EDez","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24489da27163ae9cb8e29430d0eecc0ba5d3e88c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320300736; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320300736?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Madrid"],"keyphrases":["The COVID","of the stroke code","The procedure","the risk of contagion and rationalize the","of hospital","for acute stroke care and the optimization of","guaranteeing the protection of healthcare professionals","guarantee the access","ensure the protection of healthcare professionals from COVID","ensure acute stroke care and optimize the care","the Ictus Madrid multidisciplinary group proposes a series of recommendations","We provide a document of recommendations as a result of the consensus of the Ictus Madrid multidisciplinary group and its Neurology Committee","systematic bibliographic review of the available publications with the terms","These recommendations can support the organization of healthcare","ictus agudo","infecci\u00F3n COVID","risks for COVID","c\u00F3digo ictus","forced a reorganization of healthcare systems and an exceptional saturation of","Neuroimaging and other","Recognize potentially COVID","as well as other already known for the authors","Grupo multidisciplinar Ictus Madrid","shown summarized under the acronym CORONA","hospital care for stroke patients","infected stroke patients","At home as soon as possible and supported follow","protecci\u00F3n","infection should be reduced and secured","Our recommendations","serie de recomendaciones","documento de recomendaciones","optimize hospital occupancy","Organize","atenci\u00F3n","contactos de riesgo","riesgo de contagios","coronavirus","profesionales sanitarios","SARS","pacientes","uso de recursos hospitalarios","avoid contagion","potentially associated","acr\u00F3nimo CORONA","sistemas sanitarios","asistencia hospitalaria","ocupaci\u00F3n hospitalaria","Organizaci\u00F3n adecuada","realizaci\u00F3n de Neuroimagen","pandemic","consenso","infections","publicaciones disponibles","sistema sanitario","Conclusions","procesos asistenciales","structured on five","Revisi\u00F3n bibliogr\u00E1fica","Methods","seguimiento seguros","Results","procedimientos","saturaci\u00F3n excepcional","apoyo","t\u00E9rminos","Comit\u00E9 de Neurolog\u00EDa","optimizaci\u00F3n","procedimiento de forma esquem\u00E1tica","ABSTRACT Background","M\u00E9todos","acceso","RESUMEN Introducci\u00F3n","pandemia","reorganizaci\u00F3n","l\u00EDneas fundamentales","contexto","conocidas","autores","actuaci\u00F3n","base","Resultados","Conclusiones"],"language":"es"},

We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated. Methods We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population. Findings Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples. Interpretation Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lokuge, K.; Banks, E.; Davis, S.; Roberts, L.; Street, T.; O\u0027Donovan, D.; Caleo, G.; Glass, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06d31a506b63d807183512e205969604c0a186a5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071217v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["community transmission chains","unrecognised community cases","unrecognised community upstream community cases","elimination of community transmission of COVID","detectable community transmission of COVID","community participation","unrecognised cases","reintroduction of transmission","hospital cases","high transmission","symptomatic cases","primary care surveillance","asymptomatic community members","primary care fever","appropriate community engagement","related transmission chains","active transmission chain","primary care patients","primary care presentations","surveillance system","symptomatic COVID","exhaustive identification","hospital surveillance","prevalence of COVID","remaining COVID","non-COVID","testing capacity","contact identification","increasing testing","cough patients","Screening","surveillance evaluation methods","syndromic fever","Wider identification","upstream contacts","varying testing capacities","appropriate early detection","scalable surveillance strategy","successful implementation of strong containment measures","increased case detection","asymptomatic disease","System requirements","population","effective management","meticulous case","complete follow-up","additional capacity","pooling of samples","reduced test sensitivity","downstream contact tracing","mathematical modelling","support","combination","messaging","potential sources of infection","week","Background","performance","interventions","tests","point","Australia","efficiency","compliance","resources","median","reproduction number","important factor","operational guidance","Interpretation","Findings","scenarios"],"language":"en"},

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dandekar, Raj; Barbastathis, George","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a9b8339e4848f1167074f91a27411a2d8c46609.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["available data","spread of infection","isolation measures","reversing quarantine measures","quarantine policies","case of Wuhan","neural network model","halting of infection","neural network augmented model","infection rates","South Korea","countries","infected case count","Italy","role","predictions","strict public health measures","buffer window","current infected curve growth","rapid government interventions","principles epidemiological equations","effective reproduction number Rt","wide variety of social distancing","limited testing","United States of America","virus","China","exponential explosion","Hubei province","locales","analysis","under-reporting","individuals travel","predicting ability","Covid","effectiveness","responses","week","recording","disease","results","paper"],"language":"en"},

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

The present study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of cancer patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data of consecutive cancer patients admitted to 33 designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China from December 17, 2019 to March 18, 2020 were retrospectively collected. The follow-up cutoff date was April 02, 2020. The clinical course and survival status of the cancer patients with COVID-19 were measured, and the potential risk factors of severe events and death were assessed through univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: A total of 283 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients (50% male; median age, 63.0 years [IQR, 55.0 to 70.0]) with more than 20 cancer types were included. The overall mortality rate was 18% (50/283), and the median hospitalization stay for the survivors was 26 days. Amongst all, 76 (27%) were former cancer patients with curative resections for over five years without recurrence. The current cancer patients exhibited worse outcomes versus former cancer patients (overall survival, HR=2.45, 95%CI 1.10 to 5.44, log-rank p=0.02; mortality rate, 21% vs 9%). Of the 207 current cancer patients, 95 (46%) have received recent anti-tumor treatment, and the highest mortality rate was observed in the patients receiving recent chemotherapy (33%), followed by surgery (26%), other anti-tumor treatments (19%), and no anti-tumor treatment (15%). In addition, a higher mortality rate was observed in patients with lymphohematopoietic malignancies (LHM) (53%, 9/17), and all seven LHM patients with recent chemotherapy died. Multivariable analysis indicated that LHM (p=0.001) was one of the independent factors associating with critical illness or death. Conclusions: This is the first systematic study comprehensively depicting COVID-19 in a large cancer cohort. Patients with tumors, especially LHM, may have poorer prognosis of COVID-19. Additional cares are warranted and non-emergency anti-tumor treatment should be cautiously used for these patients under the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, J.; Song, Q.; Chen, Y.; Wang, Z.; Chu, Q.; Gong, H.; Cai, S.; Dong, X.; Xu, B.; Hu, W.; Wang, Q.; Li, L.; Yang, J.; Xie, Z.; Luo, Z.; Liu, J.; Luo, X.; Ren, J.; Rao, Z.; Xu, X.; Pan, D.; Hu, Z.; Feng, G.; Hu, C.; Luo, L.; Lu, H.; Ran, R.; Jin, J.; Xu, Y.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Kuang, L.; Wang, R.; Dong, Y.; Sun, J.; Yi, T.; Wu, H.; Liu, M.; Xu, J.; Duan, J.; Zhao, Z.; Wang, G.; He, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d6578570cccb074e98edee339334b26dd7dc2f8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20083246v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LHM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["LHM patients","current cancer patients","large cohort of cancer patients","Data of consecutive cancer patients","cancer types","large cancer cohort","outcomes of COVID","recent anti-tumor treatment","overall mortality rate","highest mortality rate","higher mortality rate","comprehensive features of COVID","poorer prognosis of COVID","anti-tumor treatments","non-emergency anti-tumor treatment","recent chemotherapy","death","overall survival","years","survival status","worse outcomes","independent factors","clinical course","clinical characteristics","median age","median hospitalization","Multivariable analysis","multivariable analyses","systematic study","present study","log-rank p","potential risk factors of severe events","Participants","HR","designated hospitals","curative resections","critical illness","male","laboratory","viral infections","Additional cares","Hubei province","lymphohematopoietic malignancies","Setting","survivors","IQR","total","follow-up cutoff date","China","Results","recurrence","vs","tumors","Background","days","Conclusions","pandemic","surgery"],"language":"en"},

The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine.

Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected \u2265 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected \u2265 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP.

A hyperinflammatory state mediated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been proposed as a driver of severe disease. Use of the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab for severe COVID-19 was first reported in China, where a case series described marked improvements in inflammatory markers, fever, oxygen requirement, and outcomes following its administration. Here, we provide the first description of a tocilizumab-treated cohort of patients with COVID-19 in the United States. We describe 11 patients from a single academic medical center, nine (82%) of whom were critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit at the time of tocilizumab administration. C-reactive protein levels decreased in all patients following treatment (median 211.6 pre- vs. 19.7 mg/L 5 days post-tocilizumab [p=0.001]). When IL-6 levels were obtained before and after therapy, wide variation was seen in baseline levels; post-dose IL-6 concentrations were consistently increased. In contrast to prior reports, we did not observe significant clinical improvement in temperature or oxygen requirements in most patients. Two patients were discharged (18%), five remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit (46%), one was weaned off the ventilator to room air (9%), and three died (27%).

With rates of new infections and fatalities potentially reaching a plateau and/or declining, restrictions on provision of routine ambulatory care are lifting, and there is a need to help guide the allergy/immunology clinician on how to re-initiate services.

Bats may be carriers and reservoirs of multiple pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and parasites, showing in the same time robust immunity against many of them. The microbiota plays a fundamental role on the induction, training and function of the host immune system and the immune system has largely evolved in order to maintain the symbiotic relationship of the host with these diverse microbes. Thus, expanding our knowledge on bat-associated microbiome it can be usefully in understanding bats\u2019 outstanding immune capacities. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of different bacterial communities in heart tissue of insectivorous bats, Nyctalus noctula, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Rhinoplophus hipposideros, from Central and Eastern Europe using high-throughput sequencing of variable regions of the 16S rRNA. In addition, species-specific PCRs were used to validate the presence of the vector-borne pathogens Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. In this study we identified a wide variety of bacterial groups, with the most abundant phyla being Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. The results showed that at individual level, the year or location had no effect on the diversity and composition of the microbiome, however host species determined both structure and abundance of the bacterial community. We report the presence of vector-borne bacteria Bartonella spp. in samples of N. noctula and indications of Rickettsia spp. in R. hipposideros. Our results provide a first insight into the bacterial community found in heart tissue of bats from Central and South Eastern Europe.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corduneanu, Alexandra; Mihalca, Andrei Daniel; S\u00E1ndor, Attila D.; Hornok, S\u00E1ndor; Malmberg, Maja; Viso, Natalia Pin; Bongcam-Rudloff, Erik","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.069815","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R. hipposideros"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern Europe","South Eastern Europe"],"keyphrases":["bacterial community","host immune system","host species","presence of different bacterial communities","presence of vector","heart tissue of bats","group specific bacterial communities","Pipistrellus pipistrellus","heart tissue of insectivorous bats","wide variety of bacterial groups","pathogens Bartonella","bacteria Bartonella","bat-associated microbiome","study","results","South Eastern Europe","reservoirs of multiple pathogens","Nyctalus noctula","Rhinoplophus hipposideros","individual level","indications of Rickettsia","understanding bats\u2019 outstanding immune capacities","assessment of zoonotic reservoirs","individual health-status","high-throughput sequencing of variable regions","training","location","early warning signs","insights","viruses","function","structure","abundance","abundant phyla","control possible episodes of emerging zoonoses","fundamental role","effect","induction","year","clues","diversity","order","samples of","composition","carriers","symbiotic relationship","Proteobacteria","Firmicutes","S rRNA","parasites","knowledge","species-specific PCRs","diverse microbes","time robust immunity","addition","microbiota","aim"],"language":"en"},

Asthma, the most common chronic illness in childhood, is of particular interest given its high burden on school absenteeism. Objectives Conduct a systematic review evaluating impact of school-based telemedicine programs on improving asthma-related outcomes. Data Sources PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Embase, and Google Scholar Study Eligibility Criteria Original research, including quasi-experimental studies, without restriction on the type of telemedicine. Participants School-aged pediatric patients with asthma and their families. Interventions School-based telemedicine. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Two authors independently screened each abstract, conducted full-text review, assessed study quality, and extracted information. A third author resolved disagreements. Results Of 371 articles identified, 7 were included for the review. Outcomes of interest were asthma symptom-free days, asthma symptom frequency, quality-of-life, healthcare utilization, school absences, and spirometry. 4/7 studies reported significant increases in symptom-free days and/or decrease in symptom frequency. 5/6 reported increases in at least one quality-of-life metric, 2/7 reported a decrease in at least one healthcare utilization metric, 1/3 showed reductions in school absences, and 1/2 reported improvements in spirometry measures. Limitations Variability in intervention designs and outcome measures make comparisons and quantitative analyses across studies difficult. Only 2/7 studies were randomized controlled trials. Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings High-quality evidence supporting the use of school-based telemedicine programs to improve patient outcomes is limited. While available evidence suggests benefit, only two comparative trials were identified, and the contribution of telemedicine to these studies\u2019 results is unclear.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Christopher H.; Lieng, Monica K.; Rylee, Tina L.; Gee, Kevin A.; Marcin, James P.; Melnikow, Joy A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd17af842713662f98c30d660afebf67ba53096f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876285920301868; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285920301868?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ERIC"],"organizations":["Google Scholar Study Eligibility Criteria Original","Study Appraisal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["school absences","use of school","impact of school","Interventions School-based telemedicine","school absenteeism","based telemedicine programs","asthma symptom frequency","telemedicine platforms","contribution of telemedicine","type of telemedicine","asthma symptom-free days","study quality","asthma-related outcomes","reported increases","Abstract Background School health systems","studies difficult","reported improvements","Participants School-aged pediatric patients","Study Appraisal","quasi-experimental studies","healthcare utilization metric","life metric","spirometry measures","systematic review","text review","patient outcomes","decrease","outcome measures","significant increases","available evidence","chronic illnesses","studies\u2019 results","comparative trials","controlled trials","common chronic illness","Google Scholar Study Eligibility Criteria Original research","Implications of Key Findings High-quality evidence","comparisons","CINAHL","Embase","Cochrane CENTRAL","PsycINFO","intervention designs","quantitative analyses","ERIC","authors","restriction","reductions","Data Sources PubMed","Limitations Variability","Synthesis Methods","Conclusions","childhood","benefit","high burden","Objectives","families","information","disagreements","articles"],"language":"en"},

Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission, characterized by an increased of alt, ast, GGT, AKP. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Z.; Chen, L.; Li, J.; Tian, C.; Zhang, Y.; Huang, S.; Liu, Z.; Cheng, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64f1fe510cb6bc6811eabac70095c7805aac35df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.26.20026971v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center","AKP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["liver function damage","liver function tests","abnormal liver function groups","emerging abnormal liver functions","elevated liver function index","emerging liver injury","related liver damage","infected patients","male patients","admission","clinical features of COVID","clinical treatment","confirmed COVID","treatment of COVID","confirmed SARS-CoV","clinical manifestations of fever","Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center","ritonavir","number of cases","vs","recent outbreak of SARS","prolonged length of stay","prehospital medications","utilization rate of lopinavir","single-center study","moderate-high degree fever","laboratory parameters","T cells","CD8","references","years","retrospective","statistical difference","median age","interquartile range","GGT","numbers of CD4","increased of alt","BACKGROUND","females","infection","AKP","China","METHODS","cough","expectoration","FINDINGS","INTERPRETATION","total","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate a possible association between parasitic infections and COVID-19. Methods: An ecological study in which we analysed WHO data on COVID-19 cases in comparison to WHO data on helminths and malaria cases using correlation, regression, and Geographical Information Services analyses. Results: Of the global 3.34 million COVID-19 cases and 238,628 deaths as at May 4th 2020, Africa reported 0.029/3.3 million (0.88%) cases and 1,064/238,628 (0.45%) deaths. In 2018, Africa reported 213/229 million (93%) of all malaria cases, 204/229 million (89%) of schistosomiasis cases, and 271/1068 million (25%) of soil-transmitted helminth cases globally. In contrast, Europe reported 1.5/3.3 million (45%) of global COVID-19 cases and 142,667/238,628 (59%) deaths. Europe had 5.8/1068 million (0.55%) soil-transmitted helminths cases and no malaria/schistosomiasis cases in 2018. We found an inverse correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 and malaria (r -0.17, p =0.002) and COVID-19 and soil-transmitted helminths (r -0.25, p \u003C0.001). Malaria-endemic countries were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; p =0.02). Similarly, countries endemic for soil-transmitted helminths were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13-0.44; p \u003C0.001), as were countries endemic for schistosomiasis (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11-0.45; p\u003C0.001). Conclusions: One plausible hypothesis for the comparatively low COVID-19 cases/deaths in parasite-endemic areas is immunomodulation induced by parasites.

This finding seemingly supports the view that the automatically determined touch location in external space affects limb assignment: the crossed right hand is localized in left space, and this conflict presumably provokes hand assignment errors. Here, participants judged on which hand the first of two stimuli, presented during a bimanual movement, had occurred, and then indicated its external location by a reach-to-point movement. When participants incorrectly chose the hand stimulated second, they pointed to where that hand had been at the correct, first time point, though no stimulus had occurred at that location. This behavior suggests that stimulus localization depended on hand assignment, not vice versa. It is, thus, incompatible with the notion of automatic computation of external stimulus location upon occurrence. Instead, humans construct external touch location post-hoc and on demand.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maij, Femke; Seegelke, Christian; Medendorp, W.

In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. We use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means. This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30.

Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells.

Tropical and subtropical countries where there is a greater risk of contracting an infectious disease are among the most frequently visited tourist destinations. The SEIMC considers it appropriate to produce a consensus document that will be useful to primary care physicians as well as specialists in internal medicine, infectious diseases and tropical medicine who help treat travelers returning from tropical and sub-tropical areas with infections. Preventive aspects of infectious diseases and infections imported by immigrants are explicitly excluded here, since they have been dealt with in other SEIMC documents. Various types of professionals (clinicians, microbiologists, and parasitologists) have helped produce this consensus document by evaluating the available evidence-based data in order to propose a series of key facts about individual aspects of the topic. The first section of the document is a summary of some of the general aspects concerning the general assessment of travelers who return home with potential infections. The main second section contains the key facts (causative agents, diagnostic procedures and therapeutic measures) associated with the major infectious syndromes affecting returned travelers [gastrointestinal syndrome (acute or persistent diarrhea); febrile syndrome with no obvious source of infection; localized cutaneous lesions; and respiratory infections]. Finally, the characteristics of special traveler subtypes, such as pregnant women and immunocompromised travelers, are described.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E8crez-Arellano, Jos\u00E8c Luis; G\u00F3rgolas-Hern\u00E1ndez-Mora, Miguel; Salvador, Fernando; Carranza-Rodr\u00EDguez, Cristina; Ram\u00EDrez-Olivencia, Germ\u00E1n; Mart\u00EDn-Echeverr\u00EDa, Esteban; Rodr\u00EDguez-Guardado, Azucena; Norman, Francesca; Velasco-Tirado, Virginia; Zubero-Sulibarr\u00EDa, Zuri\u00F1e; Rojo-Marcos, Gerardo; Mu\u00F1oz-Gutierrez, Jos\u00E8c; Ramos-Rinc\u00F3n, Jos\u00E8c Manuel; S\u00E1nchez-Seco-Fari\u00F1as, M.

Because the frequency content of nerve activity falls in a higher frequency range than that of the ECG and myopotential, it is possible to use high-pass or band-pass filtering to specifically isolate the SKNA. neuECG is voltage calibrated and does not require invasive procedures to impale electrodes in nerves and thus has advantages over microneurography.

To address this limitation, here we demonstrate a mouse model carrying a HaloTag-TEV insertion in the protein titin, the main determinant of myocyte stiffness. Using our system, we specifically sever titin by digestion with TEV protease, and find that the response of muscle fibers to length changes requires mechanical transduction through titin\u0027s intact polypeptide chain. In addition, HaloTag-based covalent tethering enables examination of titin dynamics under force using magnetic tweezers. At pulling forces \u003C 10 pN, titin domains are recruited to the unfolded state, and produce 41.5 zJ mechanical work during refolding.

Early recognition and treatment of MAS are very important, but sometimes it is difficult to distinguish MAS from a severe form of KD. DATA SOURCES A PubMed search was performed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \u0022macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\u0022 and \u0022Kawasaki disease\u0022. RESULTS KD patients with MAS show high intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary complications. Mortality is also as high as MAS in other diseases. Persistent fever greater than 10 days is highly associated with development of MAS in KD. Splenomegaly is observed in more than two-thirds of KD patients with MAS. Thrombocytopenia is often the earliest laboratory finding of MAS. Hyperferritinemia is highly specific and sensitive for detecting MAS in KD; so, ferritin levels should be checked if there are unexplained clinical exacerbations in KD patients. Given the under-recognition of MAS in KD, it is prudent to consider resistant KD as occult/subclinical MAS. Many KD patients with MAS have good outcomes on immune modulators. However, if KD patients fulfill the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, they may undergo longer and more intensive treatment than needed. CONCLUSIONS The possible existence of MAS should be taken into account when a KD patient shows persistent fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, or IVIG resistance. The under-diagnosis of MAS in patients with KD is an important issue to be addressed. Therapeutically, however, there is a possibility of over-treatment of MAS in patients with KD.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Seung Beom; Lee, Soo-Young","journal":"World journal of pediatrics : WJP","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-020-00360-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","MAS","KD","IVIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subclinical MAS","development of MAS","resistant KD","RESULTS KD patients","thirds of KD patients","under-recognition of MAS","under-diagnosis of MAS","possible existence of MAS","severe form of KD","possibility of over-treatment of MAS","HLH","IVIG resistance","Thrombocytopenia","Hyperferritinemia","Splenomegaly","intensive treatment","BACKGROUND Macrophage activation syndrome","Persistent fever greater","Clinical Queries","life-threatening complication of Kawasaki disease","important issue","Early recognition","high intravenous immunoglobulin","unexplained clinical exacerbations","key terms","secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","good outcomes","PubMed search","occult","days","immune modulators","account","coronary complications","DATA SOURCES","CONCLUSIONS","earliest laboratory","diagnostic criteria","ferritin levels","Mortality","diseases"],"language":"en"},

Social media, especially, Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media platform), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and express their demand. OBJECTIVE This study aims to analyze the characteristics of the suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients who asked for help on the Sina Weibo. METHODS We conducted data mining on the Chinese social media site Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients that presented with at least clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 9,878 posts seeking help on Weibo from February 3rd to 20th, 2020.We used descriptive research method to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of the patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distance from their home to the nearest hospital was calculated using geographic information systems (ArcGIS). RESULTS All patients seeking help on Weibo in this study lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR, 55.0-71.0). Fever (84.12%, 408/485) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (75.48%, 237/314) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography.39.67% (167/421) of families had laboratory-confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19 family members. 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 laboratory-confirmed and/or suspected family members.70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their descendants for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR, 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR, 6.0-12.0). 32.22% (155/481) of patients lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest hospital. CONCLUSIONS The patients seeking help on Weibo lived in Wuhan and most of the patients were elderly. Most of patients had fever symptoms and chest computed tomography mainly manifested as ground-glass opacity pattern. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most of families lived far from the hospital. Therefore, (1) We recommend that the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission of family cluster; (2) Social media can help these patients get early attention during the closure of Wuhan. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public help demands.

It has been reported that right from the beginning of the outbreak in Lombardy up to 20 % of the doctors and nurses became infected. Under these circumstances, the regular operation of health institutions already suffering from a shortage of staff becomes difficult. This has led to complete or partial shutdowns of hospitals, either due to a lack of uninfected personnel or because of uncontrollable chains of infection endangering patients. In one of the largest university perinatal center in Bavaria with more than 3,000 births per year, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in March 2020, affecting 36 staff members, including doctors, nurses and midwives. Here, we describe the outbreak and present the measures contributing to the successful containment of the outbreak within three weeks. At the same time, clinical services could be maintained, however, not without deployment of personnel exposed to employees infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apart from massive testing of personnel in predefined phases and increased hygiene measures, including a general obligation to wear surgical face masks, we identified the need to monitor cases of illness across all groups of employees, to ensure social distancing within personnel and to evaluate contacts of clinical personnel outside of the hospital environment, in order to be able to interpret chains of infections and to disrupt them.

SUDEP shares many features with sudden cardiac death and sudden unexplained death in the young and may have a similar genetic contribution. We aim to systematically review the literature on the genetics of SUDEP. Methods and Results PubMed, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, Ovid Medline In-Process \u0026 Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus were searched through April 4, 2017. English language human studies analyzing SUDEP for known sudden death, ion channel and arrhythmia-related pathogenic variants, novel variant discovery, and copy number variant analyses were included. Aggregate descriptive statistics were generated; data were insufficient for meta-analysis. A total of 8 studies with 161 unique individuals were included; mean was age 29.0 (\u00B1SD 14.2) years; 61% males; ECG data were reported in 7.5% of cases; 50.7% were found prone and 58% of deaths were nocturnal. Cause included all types of epilepsy. Antemortem diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and autism (with duplication of chromosome 15) was associated with 11% and 9% of cases. The most frequently detected known pathogenic variants at postmortem were in Na\u002B and K\u002B ion channel subunits, as were novel potentially pathogenic variants (11%). Overall, the majority of variants were of unknown significance. Analysis of copy number variant was insignificant. Conclusions SUDEP case adjudication and evaluation remains limited largely because of crucial missing data such as ECGs. The most frequent pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants identified by molecular autopsy are in ion channel or arrhythmia-related genes, with an \u224811% discovery rate.

The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning, given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen and the acceptable specimen types. An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate, or perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate. Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role in during our global response to this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theel, Elitza S; Slev, Patricia; Wheeler, Sarah; Couturier, Marc Roger; Wong, Susan J; Kadkhoda, Kamran","journal":"Journal of clinical microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00797-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350047/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA","Food and Drug Administration","EUA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of serologic assays","manufacturers of serologic assays","available serologic assays","serologic testing","SARS-CoV","absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests","EUA","molecular tests","clinical application of SARS","number of scenarios","global response","immune response","reported results","targeted antigen","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","emergency use authorization","Drug Administration","voluntary process","submission","performance","identification of COVID","lack","antibody class","acceptable specimen types","role","clear understanding","rapid development","format","Food","literature","added complication","brief summary","infections","pandemic","comment"],"language":"en"},

CLINICAL FINDINGS Physical examination of the anesthetized animal revealed tick infestation, normal mentation, and a lack of evidence of traumatic injuries. Radiography revealed no clinically relevant abnormalities. Hematologic analysis results were generally unremarkable, and serologic tests for exposure to feline coronavirus, FeLV, FIV, and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. Results of PCR assays for flea- and common tick-borne organisms other than Bartonella clarridgeiae were negative. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Ticks were manually removed, and the patient received supportive care and fipronil treatment. The bobcat made a full recovery within 72 hours after treatment for ticks, and a presumptive diagnosis of tick paralysis was made. Identified tick species included Dermacenter variabilis, Amblyomma americanum, and Ixodes scapularis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To the authors\u0027 knowledge, tick paralysis has not previously been reported in felids outside Australia. This disease should be considered a differential diagnosis in felids, including exotic cats, with signs of neuromuscular disease of unknown etiopathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Persky, Meredith E; Jafarey, Yousuf S; Christoff, Sarah E; Maddox, Dewey D; Stowell, Stephanie A; Norton, Terry M","journal":"Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.256.3.362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31961273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bartonella","CLINICAL RELEVANCE"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["tick species","presumptive diagnosis of tick paralysis","fipronil treatment","felids","anesthetized animal revealed tick infestation","signs of pelvic limb paralysis","differential diagnosis","male bobcat","CLINICAL RELEVANCE","OUTCOME Ticks","signs of neuromuscular disease of unknown etiopathogenesis","Results of PCR assays","Hematologic analysis results","CLINICAL FINDINGS Physical examination","normal mentation","Amblyomma americanum","common tick-borne organisms","FeLV","exposure","feline coronavirus","FIV","flea","exotic cats","serologic tests","Dermacenter variabilis","Bartonella clarridgeiae","authors\u0027 knowledge","lack of evidence","Lynx rufus","Toxoplasma gondii","patient","supportive care","Ixodes scapularis","CASE DESCRIPTION","traumatic injuries","recovery","hours","Radiography","relevant abnormalities"],"language":"en"},

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.0%) compared to the World Health Organization\u0027s globally-reported rate (6.8%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%). The low CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment enables public health response and reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Communicable diseases intelligence","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.36; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343939/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CFR"],"locations":["Australia","United States of America","United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["Confirmed cases","case detection","detection of mild cases","public health measures","Australia","public health response","public health action","likely reflective of high case ascertainment","crude case fatality rate","World Health Organization\u0027s","international travel","low CFR","reduction of disease transmission","disease dynamics","country","notifications","recent overseas travel","United Kingdom","rates of increase","social distancing measures","Interpretation of international epidemiology","United States of America","domestic movement","people","differences","comparable high-income countries","small portion unable","caution","spread","deaths","distribution","jurisdiction","regions","trend"],"language":"en"},

In a single center, 50 patients with HCC underwent percutaneous MW ablation between November 2016 and March 2019. Each patient underwent a contrast-enhanced CT exam at 24 h and at 1 month after the procedure. For each patient, was assessed the presence or absence of residual disease, the appearance of a new lesion, complications, and the involvement of the hepatic capsule, both at 24-h and at 1 month. Overall correlation between residual disease, appearance of a new nodule and complications was also assessed. A total of 50 hepatic lesions were treated with US-guided MW ablation. Patients\u0027 mean age was 70.9 years (range 28-87 years). Mean nodule diameter was 17.6 mm (range 7-35 mm). Contingency tables and the \u03C72 test showed a strong association when looking at capsule involvement (accuracy: 100%), residual disease (accuracy: 90%; p-value 0.003), and the appearance of a new HCC nodule (accuracy: 88%; p-value 0.007); regarding complications, the accuracy was 78% (p-value 0.014). Optimal correlation was reached in 62% of cases, moderate correlation in 26%, minimum correlation in 10% of cases; no cases of zero correlation were recorded. CT at 24 h and 1 month showed comparable efficacy in evaluating residual disease after MW thermal ablation of liver lesions.

For this study, we used concomitant measurements of heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, EEG, and brain oxygenation - measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. These measurements were obtained from 22 neonates undergoing an INSURE procedure (INtubation, SURfactant and Extubation) and sedation using propofol. To develop the monitoring framework using tensors, we used radial basis kernel function (RBF) to construct a similarity matrix for consecutive segments of the signals. These matrices were concatenated forming a tensor. Updating canonical polyadic decomposition was used to evaluate the impact of propofol in the coupling between the different signals. Results indicate, as previously reported, a drop in the interaction between signals due to propofol administration. This shows that tensor decompositions can be useful in order to monitor the coupling between different physiological signals.","publish_time":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caicedo, A; Wel, O De; Vandecappelle, M; Thewissen, L; Smits, A; Allegaert, K; Lathauwer, L De; Naulaers, G; Huffel, S Van","journal":"Conference proceedings : ...

OBJECTIVES To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings METHODS: Nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data. Using a consensus, we described 5 clinical patterns. We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, severity, and prognosis. RESULTS Lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (Pseudo-chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%). Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms). The pseudo-chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID-19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID-19. Severity of COVID-19 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to most severe in the latter groups. Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings. Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo-chilblain and vesicular).

This article introduces a unique approach to general surgery resident allocation by dividing patient care into separate inpatient care, operating care, and clinic care teams. Separate teams made up of all resident levels will work in each setting for a 1-week period. By creating this emergency structure, we have limited the number of surgery residents with direct patient contact and have created teams working in isolation from one another to optimize physical distancing while still performing required work. This also provides a resident reserve without exposure to the virus, theoretically flattening the curve among our general surgery resident cohort. Surgical resident team restructuring is critical during a pandemic to optimize patient care and ensure the well-being and vitality of the resident workforce while ensuring the entire workforce is not compromised.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nassar, Amer H; Zern, Nicole K; McIntyre, Lisa K; Lynge, Dana; Smith, Caitlin A; Petersen, Rebecca P; Horvath, Karen D; Wood, Douglas E","journal":"JAMA surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2020.1219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Seattle","Washington","United States"],"keyphrases":["resident workforce","facility\u0027s general surgery resident care teams","general surgery resident allocation","general surgery resident cohort","operating care","excellent patient care","clinic care teams","resident reserve","resident levels","Division of General Surgery","separate inpatient care","Separate teams","Surgical resident team restructuring","number of surgery residents","University of Washington Department of Surgery","workforce well-being","direct patient contact","emergency restructuring","entire workforce","Seattle","physical distancing requirements","emergency structure","required work","unique approach","attempt","epidemic","epicenter","pandemic","curve","coronavirus disease","setting","vitality","United States","article","exposure","isolation","response","week period"],"language":"en"},

Recent methodological advances have revealed functional magnetic resonance imaging-like connectivity networks using electroencephalography (EEG), a tool more easily implemented in clinical practice. Objective To determine whether EEG connectivity could reveal neural moderators of antidepressant treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants In this nonprespecified secondary analysis, data were analyzed from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinic Care study, a placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Recruitment began July 29, 2011, and was completed December 15, 2015. A random sample of 221 outpatients with depression aged 18 to 65 years who were not taking medication for depression was recruited and assessed at 4 clinical sites. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Statistical analysis was performed from November 16, 2018, to May 23, 2019. Interventions Patients received either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline hydrochloride or placebo for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures Electroencephalographic orthogonalized power envelope connectivity analyses were applied to resting-state EEG data. Intent-to-treat prediction linear mixed models were used to determine which pretreatment connectivity patterns were associated with response to sertraline vs placebo. The primary clinical outcome was the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, administered at each study visit. Results Of the participants recruited, 9 withdrew after first dose owing to reported adverse effects, and 221 participants (150 women; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.7] years) underwent EEG recordings and had high-quality pretreatment EEG data. After correction for multiple comparisons, connectome-wide analyses revealed moderation by connections within and between widespread cortical regions-most prominently parietal-for both the antidepressant and placebo groups. Greater alpha-band and lower gamma-band connectivity predicted better placebo outcomes and worse antidepressant outcomes. Lower connectivity levels in these moderating connections were associated with higher levels of anhedonia. Connectivity features that moderate treatment response differentially by treatment group were distinct from connectivity features that change from baseline to 1 week into treatment. The group mean (SD) score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was 18.35 (4.58) at baseline and 26.14 (30.37) across all time points. Conclusions and Relevance These findings establish the utility of EEG-based network functional connectivity analyses for differentiating between responses to an antidepressant vs placebo. A role emerged for parietal cortical regions in predicting placebo outcome. From a treatment perspective, capitalizing on the therapeutic components leading to placebo response differentially from antidepressant response should provide an alternative direction toward establishing a placebo signature in clinical trials, thereby enhancing the signal detection in randomized clinical trials.

So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza virus. In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID-19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019-nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yousefi, Bahman; Valizadeh, Saeid; Ghaffari, Hadi; Vahedi, Azadeh; Karbalaei, Mohsen; Eslami, Majid","journal":"Journal of cellular physiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID","LPV"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["respiratory patients","patients of COVID","SARS-CoV","respiratory problems","respiratory symptoms","MERS-CoV","CoV disease","coronavirus disease","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","spread of coronavirus","novel coronavirus","LPV","nCoV virus","virus replication","early replication of SARS","direct antiviral effect","stronger antiviral effect","Favipiravir","mortality","hydroxychloroquine","Influenza virus","addition of corticosteroids","treatments available","combination","Ribavirin","entry","significant protective effect","progression of MERS","clinical problem","clinical recovery","ACE2 inhibitor","appropriate treatment","protease inhibitors","Neuraminidase inhibitors","specific treatments","therapeutic window of drugs available","similar viruses","lopinavir","cell","cytokine storm","target teicoplanin","peramivir","overdose","previous experience","China","agent","ritonavir","remdesivir","soluble form","inflammatory response","recombinant protein","viral pneumonia","hemoglobin concentrations","oseltamivir","toxicity","zanamivir","Arbidol","enzyme","Wuhan","binding","Angiotensin","Cathepsin","article"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to summarize a personal experience of CUT anatomic lung resection with systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy (CUT-ALR-SML) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate the feasibility and safety of CUT-ALR-SML in our institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 326 patients with NSCLC were chosen to undergo CUT-ALR-SML in our institute from August 2013 to July 2018. Data such as clinicopathologic characteristics and perioperative outcomes were reviewed in this article. RESULTS For the 326 cases of ALR, the specific procedures and the corresponding number of cases were as follows: segmentectomy, 90; lobectomy, 218; sleeve lobectomy, 9; ipsilateral lobe combined with segment resected synchronously (i-L\u002BS), 6; and pneumonectomy, 3. A total of 31 cases required conversion to open surgery, and 4 cases were converted to multiportal thoracoscopic surgery. All patients underwent SML. The average mediastinal lymph node stations and mediastinal lymph nodes dissected under CUT-ALR-SML were 3.3\u00B11.4 and 9.6\u00B18.4, respectively. Approximately 99.7% of the patients acquired free resection margins. A total of 42 (12.9%) patients suffered from postoperative complications, and 1 patient died of pneumonia during the perioperative period. CONCLUSIONS Complete uniportal ALR, particularly for segmentectomy and lobectomy is safe and feasible with low complication rates and excellent free resection margin rates. SML during complete uniportal thoracoscopic surgery adequately assesses the N2 lymph node. However, further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the role of CUT-ALR-SML in the treatment of NSCLC.","publish_time":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Youjun; Wang, Jiaqing; Mu, Juwei; Wang, Zheng; Wang, Guangsuo","journal":"Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy \u0026 percutaneous techniques","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31764861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NSCLC","SML"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CUT-ALR","ALR-SML","cases of ALR","safety of CUT","role of CUT","patients","CONCLUSIONS Complete uniportal ALR","complete uniportal thoracoscopic surgery","total","multiportal thoracoscopic surgery","personal experience of CUT anatomic lung resection","open surgery","treatment of NSCLC","mediastinal lymph nodes","average mediastinal lymph node stations","N2 lymph node","free resection margins","corresponding number of cases","sleeve lobectomy","segmentectomy","institute","excellent free resection margin rates","systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy","perioperative outcomes","perioperative period","low complication rates","treatment of thoracic diseases","non-small cell lung cancer","potential outcome","growing popularity","specific procedures","clinicopathologic characteristics","ipsilateral lobe","conversion","feasibility","BACKGROUND","pneumonia","Data","postoperative complications","METHODS","study","article","MATERIALS","RESULTS","pneumonectomy","studies"],"language":"en"},

There is a dearth of research on whether the provinces\u0027 approaches to managing wait lists are equitable from a patients\u0027 needs perspective or if they are associated with patients\u0027 perception of outcomes. The surgical cost models used in the past won\u0027t be useful to governments and hospital managers. New models based on hospitals\u0027 marginal costs, associated with running on weekends or off-hours and social distancing parameters, will be needed.

METHODS We searched Pubmed and Embase between 15 January 2016 and 26 June 2019 for longitudinal studies comparing incident HIV infection among women using a hormonal contraceptive method and either non-users or users of another specific hormonal contraceptive method. We extracted information from newly identified studies, assessed study quality, and updated forest plots and meta-analyses. RESULTS In addition to 31 previously included studies, five more were identified; three provided higher quality evidence. A randomised clinical trial (RCT) found no statistically significant differences in HIV risk among users of intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), levonorgestrel implant (LNG implant) or the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD). An observational study found no statistically significant differences in HIV risk among women using DMPA, norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), implants (type not specified) or Cu-IUD. Updated results from a previously included observational study continued to find a statistically significant increased HIV risk with oral contraceptives and DMPA compared with no contraceptive use, and found no association between LNG implant and HIV risk. CONCLUSIONS High-quality RCT data comparing use of DMPA, LNG implant and Cu-IUD does not support previous concerns from observational studies that DMPA-IM use increases the risk of HIV acquisition. Use of other hormonal contraceptive methods (oral contraceptives, NET-EN and implants) is not associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curtis, Kathryn M; Hannaford, Philip C; Rodriguez, Maria Isabel; Chipato, Tsungai; Steyn, Petrus S; Kiarie, James N","journal":"BMJ sexual \u0026 reproductive health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2019-200509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31919239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of DMPA","significant increased HIV risk","increased risk of HIV acquisition","contraceptive use","DMPA-IM use","LNG implant","observational studies","incident HIV infection","hormonal contraception use","hormonal contraceptive methods","observational study","Cu-IUD","identified studies","included studies","specific hormonal contraceptive method","significant differences","levonorgestrel implant","longitudinal studies","study quality","non-users","women","oral contraceptives","NET-EN","Updated results","implants","users of intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate","updated forest plots","higher quality evidence","CONCLUSIONS High-quality RCT data","association","copper intrauterine device","systematic review","norethisterone enanthate","previous concerns","meta-analyses","randomised clinical trial","type","addition","OBJECTIVE","Pubmed","Embase","information"],"language":"en"},

We aimed at quantifying the lung deposition of poractant alfa with a new supraglottic delivery system for surfactant atomization in an experimental neonatal model. METHODS The method involved six sedated 1-day-old piglets lying in the lateral decubitus, spontaneously breathing on nasal-mask continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). A pharyngeal cannula housing a multi-channel air-blasting atomization catheter was placed through the mouth with its tip above the glottis entrance. In all, 200 mg kg-1 of a 99mTc-surfactant mixture was atomized through the catheter synchronously with inspiration. Six intubated control piglets received an equal amount of intratracheally instilled 99mTc-surfactant mixture. The percentage of the 99mTc-surfactant mixture deposited in the lungs was estimated by scintigraphy. RESULTS Median (range) deposition in the lungs was 40% (24-68%) after atomization and 87% (55-95%) after instillation (p \u003C 0.001). Overall, almost 80% of the deposited surfactant was in the dependent lung. Effective atomization time (atomizer on) was 28 (17-52) min, yielding an output rate of 0.1-0.2 mL min-1. CONCLUSIONS Without endotracheal intubation, in spontaneously breathing newborn piglets, this new supraglottic atomizer delivery system attained a median lung deposition of 40% of the nominal dose of surfactant.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nord, Anders; Linner, Rikard; Milesi, Ilaria; Zannin, Emanuela; di Castri, Marco; Bianco, Federico; Dellac\u00E1, Raffaele L; Cunha-Goncalves, Doris; Perez-de-Sa, Valeria","journal":"Pediatric research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0696-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31785590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surfactant atomization","deposited surfactant","mTc-surfactant mixture","effective lung doses of surfactant","median lung deposition","atomization catheter","nominal dose of surfactant","dependent lung","Effective atomization time","lung deposition of poractant alfa","new supraglottic delivery system","new supraglottic atomizer delivery system","newborn piglets","day-old piglets","lungs","intubated control piglets","RESULTS Median","nasal-mask continuous positive airway pressure","multi-channel air","aerosolization","nCPAP","BACKGROUND Earlier attempts","experimental neonatal model","pharyngeal cannula","lateral decubitus","mouth","range","endotracheal intubation","tip","glottis entrance","technical shortcomings","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","percentage","instillation","output rate","scintigraphy","inspiration"],"language":"en"},

However, there is limited information about the clinical characteristics of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 or about interventions to control COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers. METHODS We collected data retrospectively through an online registration system that includes all patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 65 centers in Wuhan, China. We reviewed epidemiologic and clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 10, 2020. RESULTS Of 7154 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 154 had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of the 131 patients in our analysis was 63.2 years; 57.3% were men. Many had underlying comorbidities, with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension) being the most common (68.7%). Only 51.9% of patients manifested fever; 21.4% of infected patients were asymptomatic. The most common finding on chest computed tomography (CT) was ground-grass or patchy opacity (82.1%). After initiating comprehensive interventions-including entrance screening of body temperature and symptoms, universal chest CT and blood tests, and other measures-new patients presenting with COVID-19 peaked at 10 per day on January 30, decreasing to 4 per day on February 11. No new cases occurred between February 26 and March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS We found that patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis were susceptible to COVID-19 and that hemodialysis centers were high-risk settings during the epidemic. Increasing prevention efforts, instituting universal screening, and isolating patients with COVID-19 and directing them to designated hemodialysis centers were effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Fei; Tang, Hui; Liu, Li; Tu, Can; Tian, Jian-Bo; Lei, Chun-Tao; Liu, Jing; Dong, Jun-Wu; Chen, Wen-Li; Wang, Xiao-Hui; Luo, Dan; Shi, Ming; Miao, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Chun","journal":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020030354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["hemodialysis centers","isolating patients","infected patients","maintenance hemodialysis","clinical characteristics of hemodialysis patients","clinical data of patients","spread of COVID","measures-new patients","cardiovascular disease","common comorbidities","universal chest CT","universal screening","common finding","hypertension","laboratory","day","severe coronavirus disease","underlying illnesses","comprehensive interventions","new cases","chest computed tomography","entrance screening of body temperature","symptoms","blood tests","diabetes mellitus","ground-grass","online registration system","older adults","high-risk settings","Wuhan","limited information","patchy opacity","prevention efforts","epidemic","years","fever","BACKGROUND Reports","China","mean age","analysis","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","men","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In this context, the communication of risk associated with experimental therapies was also very important. The lessons we will learn from this emergency may result crucial in redesigning a better way of conducting clinical trials and information on drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Addis, Antonio","journal":"Recenti progressi in medicina","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1701/3347.33174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical trials","regulatory process","clinical centres","clinical pharmacological research","specific therapies","experimental therapies","label drugs","standard of care","cause of CoViD","supportive care","use of medicines","national regulatory body","approval of new trials","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","term of priorities","SARS-CoV","absence of efficacy","better way","communication of risk","therapeutic uncertainties","AIFA","information","difficulty","safety data","short time","things","emergency","context","pandemic force","lessons","consequences"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. They were admitted to the Third People\u0027s Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions. Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, K; Yun, Y X; Wang, X F; Yang, G D; Zheng, Y J; Lin, C M; Wang, L F","journal":"Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200210-00071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","early chest CT images of children","nCoV infection","nCoV nucleic acid","similar chest CT inflammation","Dynamic reexamination of chest CT","patients","small nodular ground glass opacities","speckled ground glass opacities","new lesions","nucleic acid test","clinical symptoms of children","morphology of pulmonary lesions","pulmonary inflammatory lesions","imaging characteristics of children","clinical data","respiratory sample","novel coronavirus","retrospective analysis","Conclusions","pharyngeal swab samples","nasal","distribution","days of treatment","People\u0027s Hospital of Shenzhen","Methods","Objective","improvement","females","visit","Results","years"],"language":"en"},

In a country with almost 5,000 Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine physicians, the webinar had 230 live viewers (4.5%), and more than 8,900 individual visualizations of the recorded version. The overall inadequate preparation of the rehabilitation system to face a sudden epidemic was clear, and similar to that of the acute services. The original idea of confining the Covid-19 cases to some areas of rehabilitation wards and/or hospitals, preserving others, proved not to be feasible. Continuous reorganization and adaptation were required due to the rapid changes. Overall, rehabilitation needs had to surrender to the more acute emergency, with total conversion of beds, wards and even hospitals. The quarantine needs heavily involved also outpatient services that were mostly closed.

The typical needs of rehabilitation, such as human and physical contacts, but also social interactions including patient, team, family and caregivers, appeared clearly in the current unavoidable need of being suppressed.

Conjunctivitis is also reported in a small number of cases. We evaluated ocular symptoms and ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in a group of patients with COVID-19. METHOD Fifty-six patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited as subjects. Relevant medical histories were obtained from the electronic medical record system. Ocular history and ocular symptoms data were obtained by communicating directly with the subjects. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Salisbury Eye Evaluation Questionnaire (SEEQ) were used to assess the anterior ocular surface condition before and after the onset of disease. RESULTS Patients classified as severe COVID-19 cases were more likely to have hypertension compared to mild cases (p = 0.035). Of the 56 subjects, thirteen patients (23%) were infected in Wuhan, 32 patients (57%) were community-infected, 10 patients (18%) were unknown origin, 1 (2%) was a physician likely infected by a confirmed patient. Three patients wore face mask with precaution when contacting the confirmed patients. Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset. The differences in mean scores of OSDI questionnaire and SEEQ between before and after onset of COVID-19 were all significant (p \u003C 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS Ocular symptoms are relatively common in COVID-19 disease and may appear just before the onset of respiratory symptoms. Our data provided the anecdotal evidences of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via ocular surface.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Nan; Yu, Wangshu; Xia, Jianhua; Shen, Ye; Yap, Maurice; Han, Wei","journal":"Acta ophthalmologica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ocular symptoms data","prodromal ocular symptoms","CONCLUSIONS Ocular symptoms","Ocular history","ocular tropism of SARS","confirmed patients","Ocular Surface Disease Index","RESULTS Patients","group of patients","SARS-CoV","onset of COVID","onset of disease","disease onset","anterior ocular surface condition","onset of respiratory symptoms","infected individuals","community-infected","subjects","severe COVID","SEEQ","mild cases","small number of cases","mean scores of OSDI questionnaire","Relevant medical histories","Salisbury Eye Evaluation Questionnaire","electronic medical record system","tears","hypertension","precaution","anecdotal evidences of transmission","differences","conjunctival samples","face mask","RNA","physician","PURPOSE","METHOD","unknown origin","Conjunctivitis","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Endoscopy and Procedures Committee has formulated this statement to offer practical guidance to help standardize endoscopy services for pediatric patients with the aim of minimizing COVID-19 transmission to staff, patients, and caregivers and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during this critical time. Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply. Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification. This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet. In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk. To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures). This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide. It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walsh, Catharine M; Fishman, Douglas S; Lerner, Diana G","journal":"Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric procedures","Pediatric endoscopic procedures","stratifying procedures","Procedures Committee","pediatric patients","Pediatric Gastroenterology","transmission","control of COVID","delivery of endoscopic care","staff","endoscopy services","aim of minimizing COVID","endoscopy facilities","high risk","Appropriate use of PPE","benefits","statement","risks","patient risk stratification","face shield","healthcare delivery","filtering face-piece respirator","droplet precautions","jurisdiction","public health agencies","N95","Hepatology","current recommendations","Nutrition","body water-resistant disposable gown","infection prevention","shoe","visor","contact","caregivers","negative pressure room","NASPGHAN","North American Society","double gloves","facial protection","personal protective equipment","PAPR","FFP2","N99","framework","practical guidance","era of Coronavirus Disease","PAUSE","emerging evidence","critical time","hairnet","supply","guide","decisions","elective"],"language":"en"},

There are few studies of the use of dashboards to improve professional practice in anesthesiology. The objective of the present study was to describe the user-centered development, implementation and preliminary evaluation of clinical dashboards dealing with anesthesia unit management and quality assessment in a French university medical center. User needs and technical requirements were identified in end user interviews and then synthesized. Several representations were then developed (according to good visualization practice) and submitted to end users for appraisal. Lastly, dashboards were implemented and made accessible for everyday use via the medical center\u0027s network. After a period of use, end user feedback on the dashboard platform was collected as a system usability score (range 0 to 100). Seventeen themes (corresponding to 29 questions and 42 indicators) were identified. After prioritization and feasibility assessment, 10 dashboards were ultimately implemented and deployed. The dashboards variously addressed the unit\u0027s overall activity, compliance with guidelines on intraoperative hemodynamics, ventilation and monitoring, and documentation of the anesthesia procedure.

With nursing vacancy rates averaging 40%, individual countries and the region collectively are challenged to address this issue through the development and implementation of sustainable, feasible strategies. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the amount, type, sources, distribution, and focus of the conceptual and empirical literature on the migration of Caribbean nurses, and to identify gaps in the literature. METHODS Identified records were selected and reviewed using Arksey and O\u0027Malley\u0027s scoping framework. A comprehensive search was conducted of eight electronic databases and the Google search engine. Findings were summarized numerically and thematically, with themes emerging through an iterative, inductive process. RESULTS Much of the literature included in our study (N = 6, 33%) originated in the United States. Publications steadily increased between 2003 and 2016, and half of them (N = 9) were journal articles. Many (N = 6, 33%) of the records used quantitative methods. The themes identified were as follows: (1) migration patterns and trends; (2) post-migration experiences; (3) past and present, policies, programs, and practices; and (4) consequences of migration to donor countries. More than half (N = 11, 56%) of the literature addressed nurse migration policies, programs, or practices, either solely or in part. Several gaps were identified including the need for evaluation of the effectiveness of current nurse migration management strategies and to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates the need for future research in key areas such as the impact of nurse migration on health systems and population health. The literature tends to focus on Caribbean countries with higher levels of nurse migration. However, data regarding this phenomenon in other Caribbean countries is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the plight of the Caribbean region and would answer the call from the International Organization for Migration to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rolle Sands, Shamel; Ingraham, Kenchera; Salami, Bukola Oladunni","journal":"Human resources for health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-00466-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32178696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","International Organization for Migration"],"locations":["United States","United Kingdom","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["migration of Caribbean nurses","nurse migration policies","understudied Caribbean countries","consequences of migration","migration patterns","impact of nurse migration","Caribbean region","individual countries","donor countries","higher levels of nurse migration","post-migration experiences","study policies","effectiveness of current nurse migration management strategies","trends","empirical literature","United States","impacts","need","programs","United Kingdom","comprehensive search","practices","scoping review","records","gaps","themes","half","health systems","feasible strategies","population health","comprehensive understanding","quantitative methods","Google search engine","O\u0027Malley\u0027s scoping framework","key areas","electronic databases","future research","past","implementation of sustainable","development","Arksey","evaluation","matter of concern","plight","International Organization","distribution","nursing vacancy rates","phenomenon","Canada","BACKGROUND","inductive process","type","sources","issue","journal articles","aim","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Publications","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to examine associations between exposure to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) news, risk perceptions, and depressive symptoms. METHODS Cross-sectional data were collected from 501 participants who were \u226518 years. Exposure to COVID-19 news was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for depression (outcome variable) with the Patient Health Questionnaire and examined the roles of risk perceptions. Multiple linear regressions and mediation analysis with 1000 bootstrap resamples were conducted. RESULTS Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% White with mean age 32.44 \u00B1 11.94 years. After controlling for sociodemographic and socio-economic factors, news exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms \u03B2 = .11; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.02-0.20. Mediation analysis showed that perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 mediated 34.4% of this relationship (\u03B2 = .04; 95%CI = 0.01-0.06).

OBJECTIVE This study examined worldwide trends of four emotions (i.e., fear, anger, sadness, and joy) and the narratives underlying those emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Over 20 million social media twitter posts made during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak from 28 January to 9 April 2020 were collected using \u0022wuhan\u0022, \u0022corona\u0022, \u0022nCov\u0022, and \u0022covid\u0022 as search keywords. RESULTS Public emotions shifted strongly from fear to anger over the course of the pandemic, while sadness and joy also surfaced. Findings from word clouds suggest that fears around shortages of COVID-19 tests and medical supplies became increasingly widespread discussion points. Anger shifted from xenophobia at the beginning of the pandemic to discourse around the stay-at-home notices. Sadness was highlighted by the topics of losing friends and family members while topics relating to joy included words of gratitude and good health. CONCLUSIONS Overall, global COVID-19 sentiments have shown rapid evolutions just within the span of a few weeks. Findings suggest that emotion-driven collective issues are developing, that are entered around shared public distress experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic which include large scale social isolation and the loss of human lives. The steady rise of societal concerns indicated by negative emotions need to be monitored and controlled by complementing regular crisis communication with strategic public health communication that aims to balance public psychological wellbeing.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lwin, May Oo; Lu, Jiahui; Sheldenkar, Anita; Schulz, Peter Johannes; Shin, Wonsun; Gupta, Raj; Yang, Yinping","journal":"JMIR public health and surveillance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412418/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shortages of COVID","global COVID","pandemic declaration","RESULTS Public emotions","joy","anger","sadness","strategic public health communication","negative emotions","good health","topics","public psychological wellbeing","sentiments","Findings","shared public distress experiences","World Health Organization\u0027s","regular crisis communication","large scale social isolation","social media twitter posts","medical supplies","government-initiated actions","early phases","tests","fears","disease","family members","widespread discussion points","words of gratitude","loss of human lives","steady rise of societal concerns","word clouds","study","worldwide trends","friends","course","rapid evolutions","span","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","BACKGROUND","xenophobia","beginning","narratives","collective issues","corona","stay-at-home notices","nCov","search keywords","CONCLUSIONS","outbreak","wuhan","weeks"],"language":"en"},

AIM OF THE STUDY To determine the findings on high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) and 24-h pH recording in patients with typical GERD symptoms, refractory to PPI treatment. METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of patients referred for HREM and 24-h pH recording was done. We selected patients who were referred for evaluation of refractory GERD symptoms despite \u003E 8 weeks of at least once-daily PPI treatment. Details noted were demographic profile, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy report, HREM findings and 24-h pH findings. RESULTS Ninety-six patients had symptoms of GERD that were refractory to PPI therapy. Seven patients (7.1%) were diagnosed having diseases mimicking GERD: eosinophilic esophagitis (n=2), supragastric belching (n=4) and rumination (n=1). After excluding these patients and those with insufficient data, the final study cohort included 82 cases. Fifty patients (61%) had normal motility. Major motility disorders were detected in 8 (9.75%) patients: achalasia cardia (6) and distal esophageal spasm (2). Ineffective esophageal motility was noted in 24 patients.

Based on STIRPAT model, this study investigates the impacts of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions in China between 2005 and 2016. Adopting the K-medians cluster method, effects in regions with high, middle, and low levels of high-tech industry development are considered. Indirect effects of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions by affecting industry structure upgrades and economic growth are explored. Empirical results illustrate a positive U-shaped nonlinear link between the level of high-tech industry development and CO2 emissions at the national level and regional (high, middle, and low) level. In terms of indirect impacts, high-tech industry development attenuates the reduction of CO2 emissions due to industry structure upgrades, and promotes economic growth to increase CO2 emissions slightly.

We continuously monitored the regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) in the brain, liver, and lower limb muscle during HD. The time course of changes in rSO2 ratios in each region was evaluated throughout HD. The rSO2 ratio was defined as the ratio of rSO2 value at t (min) during HD to the rSO2 value before HD. During the early phase of HD, blood pressure (BP) gradually decreased and both hepatic and lower limb muscle rSO2 ratios decreased with changes in BP, whereas the cerebral rSO2 ratio was relatively maintained. At around 90 min after HD initiation, the BP decreased to 71/46 mmHg (mean BP, 54 mmHg) and the previously maintained cerebral rSO2 ratio also suddenly decreased. Soon after the onset of IDH, ultrafiltration was stopped, normal saline was infused, and intravenous noradrenaline infusion was started. After the BP recovered, cerebral and hepatic rSO2 ratios improved, but the lower limb muscle rSO2 ratio remained low. After restarting ultrafiltration, improvement in the lower limb muscle rSO2 ratio was delayed, although cerebral and hepatic oxygenation were maintained.

This systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature on mechanisms of delivery for a range of infectious disease-related interventions provided to conflict-affected women, children and adolescents. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsychINFO databases for literature published in English from January 1990 to March 2018. Eligible publications reported on conflict-affected neonates, children, adolescents or women in LMICs who received an infectious disease intervention. We extracted and synthesised information on delivery characteristics, including delivery site and personnel involved, as well as barriers and facilitators, and we tabulated reported intervention coverage and effectiveness data. RESULTS A majority of the 194 eligible publications reported on intervention delivery in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccines for measles and polio were the most commonly reported interventions, followed by malaria treatment. Over two-thirds of reported interventions were delivered in camp settings for displaced families. The use of clinics as a delivery site was reported across all intervention types, but outreach and community-based delivery were also reported for many interventions. Key barriers to service delivery included restricted access to target populations; conversely, adopting social mobilisation strategies and collaborating with community figures were reported as facilitating intervention delivery. Few publications reported on intervention coverage, mostly reporting variable coverage for vaccines, and fewer reported on intervention effectiveness, mostly for malaria treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS Despite an increased focus on health outcomes in humanitarian crises, our review highlights important gaps in the literature on intervention delivery among specific subpopulations and geographies. This indicates a need for more rigorous research and reporting on effective strategies for delivering infectious disease interventions in different conflict contexts.

Leachate samples were collected, at a sanitary landfill, immediately after the exit from the landfill, i.e. raw leachate (collection point A), after conventional treatment (point B) and after treatment by wetlands (point C). D. parodizi specimens were exposed to 3%, 10% and control (0%) dilutions of leachate from these collection points for 7 days. Markers of antioxidant defences and cell damage were analysed. At point B, the gills of D. parodizi showed higher glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity; the latter is a supplier of glutathione reductase (GSH). The low GST activity at point A was associated with the hormesis effect. Higher levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) occurred at point A. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was inhibited at the points with the highest pollutant load and at the highest leachate dilutions. Higher levels of markers at point A may be related to the high pollutant charge and specific compounds present in the untreated leachate. The multi-xenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR), metallothionein-like proteins (MT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) did not vary among treatments. The biomarker responses showed negative effects of the leachate on the freshwater bivalve and simultaneously showed that the wetland treatment employed at the Caximba sanitary landfill is effective.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prestes, Juliani Giselli; De Souza, Maria Rosa Dmengeon Pedreiro; Kandalski, Priscila Krebsbach; Herrerias, Tatiana; Machado, Cintia; de Arruda Martins, Elen; Dos Anjos, Vanessa Abelaira; Neundorf, Ananda Karla Alves; Pereira, Diego Mauro Carneiro; Moura, Maur\u00EDcio Osvaldo; Donatti, Lucelia","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08721-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for Otolaryngologic surgery in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS We reviewed relevant publications and position statements regarding the management of Otolaryngology patients in the setting of COVID-19. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed. RESULTS Enhanced personal protective equipment (N95 respirator and face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable cap and gown, gloves) is required for any Otolaryngology patient with unknown, suspected, or positive COVID-19 status.

METHODS Patients undergoing curative-intent resection for primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) between 2005 and 2017 were analyzed using a large, international multi-institutional dataset. Rates of TO were assessed over time. Factors associated with achieving a TO and the impact of TO on long-term survival were examined. RESULTS Among 1829 patients, 944 (51.6%) and 885 (48.4%) individuals underwent curative-intent resection for HCC and ICC, respectively. Over time, patients were older, more frequently had ASA class \u003E 2, albumin-bilirubin grade 2/3, major vascular invasion and more frequently underwent major liver resection (all p \u003C 0.05). Overall, a total of 1126 (62.0%) patients achieved a TO. No increasing trends in TO rates were noted over the years (ptrend = 0.90). In addition, there was no increasing trend in the TO rates among patients undergoing either major (ptrend = 0.39) or minor liver resection (ptrend = 0.63) over the study period. Achieving a TO was independently associated with 26% and 37% decreased hazards of death among ICC (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.56-0.97) and HCC patients (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.46-0.85), respectively. CONCLUSION Approximately 6 in 10 patients undergoing surgery for primary liver tumors achieved a TO. While TO rates did not increase over time, TO was associated with better long-term outcomes following liver resection for both HCC and ICC.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsilimigras, Diamantis I; Sahara, Kota; Moris, Dimitrios; Mehta, Rittal; Paredes, Anghela Z; Ratti, Francesca; Marques, Hugo P; Soubrane, Olivier; Lam, Vincent; Poultsides, George A; Popescu, Irinel; Alexandrescu, Sorin; Martel, Guillaume; Workneh, Aklile; Guglielmi, Alfredo; Hugh, Tom; Aldrighetti, Luca; Weiss, Matthew; Bauer, Todd W; Maithel, Shishir K; Pulitano, Carlo; Shen, Feng; Koerkamp, Bas Groot; Endo, Itaru; Pawlik, Timothy M","journal":"Annals of surgical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08548-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICC","HCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCC patients","rates","major liver resection","METHODS Patients","minor liver resection","ICC","time","primary liver malignancies","primary liver cancer","primary liver tumors","curative-intent resection","ptrend","hepatobiliary surgery","HR","increasing trends","major vascular invasion","better long-term outcomes","trends of textbook outcomes","current study","long-term survival","study period","hepatocellular carcinoma","albumin-bilirubin grade","intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma","international multi-institutional dataset","decreased hazards of death","ASA class","change of practice","INTRODUCTION","objective","individuals","impact","addition","years","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","Factors","total"],"language":"en"},

We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17th and 18th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721-5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612-3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts decisions (0.398: 0.339-0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353-0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776-2.425 for infection probability of 30%\u002B ) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts decisions were the most important predictors.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bi, Qifang; Wu, Yongsheng; Mei, Shujiang; Ye, Chenfei; Zou, Xuan; Zhang, Zhen; Liu, Xiaojian; Wei, Lan; Truelove, Shaun A; Zhang, Tong; Gao, Wei; Cheng, Cong; Tang, Xiujuan; Wu, Xiaoliang; Wu, Yu; Sun, Binbin; Huang, Suli; Sun, Yu; Zhang, Juncen; Ma, Ting; Lessler, Justin; Feng, Teijian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a73b880acd8983f87b210ff7fee434fd6ecc8c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shenzhen","China"],"keyphrases":["time cases","Findings Cases","days","transmission risk","number of asymptomatic cases","SARS-CoV","contact tracing","Household contacts","metrics of disease transmission","uninfected close contacts","analyses of transmission","heightened surveillance","general population","higher risk of infection","similar risk of infection","isolation","symptomatic surveillance","median time","children","impact of control","key metrics of disease course","key insights","Background Rapid spread of SARS","mean age","Shenzhen CDC","resulting data","overall impact","severe symptoms","mean serial interval","observed reproductive number","household secondary attack rate","moderate clinical severity","rare opportunity","confirmation","Wuhan","factors","initial assessment","percent","symptom onset","community","Methods","recovery","work","average","hospitalization","China","epidemiology","Interpretation","females","adults"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Data obtained from independent verification studies and clinical testing of the HM-JACKarc FIT method in routine primary care practice were analysed to derive analytical performance characteristics. Results: Detection capabilities for the FIT method were 0.5 microg/g (limit of blank), 1.1 microg/g (limit of detection) and 15.0 microg/g (limit of quantification). 31 of 33 (94%) non-homogenised specimens analysed in triplicate were consistently categorised relative to 10 microg/g compared to all 33 (100%) homogenised specimens. Imprecision in non-homogenised specimens was higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% - 48.6%)) than in homogenised specimens (10.2%, (7.0 to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed (p=0.26). Conclusions: The FIT method is capable of detecting Hb at concentrations well below the DG30 threshold of 10 microg/g. However, total imprecision is considerable when including sampling variation. Binary categorisation against a single defined threshold above and below 10 microg/g was more consistent and improved following specimen homogenisation. This approach may be more appropriate when reporting results for symptomatic patients tested in primary care, including those who have had definitive investigation delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need to be re-prioritised.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, T.

During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuite, Ashleigh; Ng, Victoria; Rees, Erin; Fisman, David","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0b33d173f1d32662e2ad8d7e85181f9b23f010c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Air Transport Association","United Nations World Tourism Organization"],"locations":["Lombardy","Europe","Africa","North America","South America","France","Austria","Croatia","Iran"],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","excluded cases","Italy necessary","non-residents of Italy","recent travel","epidemic of COVID","air travel volume","outbound travel","overland travel","Italian epidemic","high volume of travel","larger epidemic size","inflated travel volumes","affected countries","bordering countries","underlying epidemic","reported case importations","reported case count","case exportations","numerous COVID","risk of COVID","International Air Transport Association","Italian cities","proportion of international travelers","total departing international air passengers","South America","official case counts","recent days","Iran","true outbreak size","sensitivity analyses","non-identification","likely route of introduction","data available","North America","relative increase","South Korea","outbreak sizes","fewer deaths","similar methods","methods of Fraser","UNWTO","United Nations World Tourism Organization","Austria","Switzerland","France","Croatia","Africa","individuals","index of connectedness","greater degree of under-reporting","account","IATA","Europe","tourists","presumed infection","exposure","flight numbers","difference","average length","time","month","reasonable probability","Lombardy region","summary","interval"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with data for the case study island nation of New Zealand (NZ) along with relevant parameters sourced from the NZ and international literature. This included a testing level for symptomatic cases of 7,800 tests per million people per week. Results: It was estimated to take between 27 and 33 days of no new detected cases for there to be a 95% probability of epidemic extinction. This was for effective reproduction numbers (Re) in the range of 0.50 to 1.0, which encompass such controls as case isolation (the shorter durations relate to low Re values). For a 99% probability of epidemic extinction, the equivalent time period was 37 to 44 days. In scenarios with lower levels of symptomatic cases seeking medical attention and lower levels of testing, the time period was up to 53 to 91 days (95% level). Conclusions: In the context of a high level of testing, a period of around one month of no new notified cases of COVID-19 would give 95% certainty that elimination of SARS-CoV-2 transmission had been achieved.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, N.; Parry, M.; Verrall, A.

The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP.

Adequate building ventilationin hospitals and public spaces is a crucial factor to contain the disease [1,2], to exit the current lockdown situation, and reduce the chance of subsequent waves of outbreaks. Lu et al. [3] reported an air-conditioner induced Covid-19 outbreak, by an asymptomatic patient, in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, which exposes our vulnerability to future outbreaks linked to ventilation in public spaces. We demonstrate that displacement ventilation(either mechanical or naturalventilation), where air intakes are at low level and extracts are at high level, is a viable alternative to negative pressure isolation rooms, which are often not available on site in hospital wards and makeshift hospitals. Displacement ventilation produces negative pressure at the occupant level, which draws fresh air from outdoor, and positive pressure near the ceiling, which expels the hot and contaminated air out. We acknowledge that, in both developed and developing countries, many modern large structures lack the openings required for natural ventilation. This lack of openings can be supplemented by installing extract fans.

Chronic exposure to air pollutants have been associated with lung ACE-2 over-expression which is known to be the main receptor for SARS-coV2. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between air pollutants concentration (PM 2.5 and NO2) and COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of transmission, number of patients, severity of presentation and number of deaths. Methods COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and mortality rate were correlated with severity of air pollution in the Italian regions. Results The highest number of COVID-19 cases were recorded in the most polluted regions with patients presenting with more severe forms of the disease requiring ICU admission. In these regions, mortality was two-fold higher than the other regions. Conclusions From the data available we propose a \u201Cdouble-hit hypothesis\u201D: chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression. This may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants in turn depleting ACE-2 receptors and impairing host defences.

However, the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in excreta of COVID-19 patients. METHODS Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and analyzed its correlation with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. RESULTS A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, which was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in feces after pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity. The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did no differ between patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces. Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients.

A previously healthy 40 year-old male was admitted to the hospital three days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, including dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath progressing to intubation and increased mechanical ventilator support. A request for compassionate use remdesivir was submitted on the same hospital day as the positive COVID-19 PCR result. Supportive measures, in addition to a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, were maintained until remdesivir could be supplied on day 9 of hospitalization, 13 days after symptom onset. Sixty hours after initiating remdesivir, the patient was successfully extubated and was able to transition to room air within 24 hours of extubation. Late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2, unlike antivirals utilized for different disease states, such as oseltamivir, which are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset. Urgent action is needed by regulatory agencies to work with drug manufacturers to expedite the study and approval of investigational agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 as well as to meet manufacturing demands.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hillaker, Emily; Belfer, Julie J; Bondici, Anamaria; Murad, Hani; Dumkow, Lisa E","journal":"Pharmacotherapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.2403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281114/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","hospital day","symptom onset","onset of coronavirus disease","compassionate use remdesivir","patient","case of late initiation of remdesivir antiviral therapy","days","community teaching hospital","day course of hydroxychloroquine","positive COVID","hours of extubation","different disease states","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","successful treatment","intubation","regulatory agencies","fever","shortness of breath","study","mixed medical ICU","approval of investigational agents","increased mechanical ventilator support","drug manufacturers","dry cough","room air","symptoms","addition","oseltamivir","antivirals","hospitalization","Urgent action","PCR result","year-old male","request","Supportive measures","manufacturing demands"],"language":"en"},

Although chest Computer Tomography (CT) represents the gold standard to assess lung involvement, with a specificity even superior to the nasal/pharyngeal swab for diagnosis, lung ultrasound examination can be a valid alternative to CT scan, with some advantages, particularly desirable for pregnant women. Indeed, ultrasound can be performed directly at bed side by a single operator, reducing the risk of spreading the outbreak among health professionals, as well as it is a radiation free exam making to be easier monitoring those patients who require serial exams. In the present study, we reported four cases of pregnant women affectd by COVID-19 infection who have been monitoring with lung ultrasound examination. All patients showed ultrasound features indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia at admission: irregular pleural lines and vertical artifacts (B-lines) were observed in all four cases, whereas patchy areas of white lung in two cases. LUS was more sensitive than chest X-ray in detecting COVID-19. Three patients had resolution of lung pathology at ultrasound after 96 h of admission. Two pregnancies are ongoing, whereas two patients had cesarean delivery with no fetal complications. PCR testing of both cord blood and newborn swabs were negative in both cases.

As a result, each species has its own distinct pattern of steroids, steroidogenic enzymes, receptors, and transporters to support its individual physiological requirements. Although the circulating steroid profile is well characterized during equine pregnancy, there is much yet to be explored regarding the factors that support steroidogenesis and steroid signaling. To obtain a holistic view of steroid-related transcripts, we sequenced chorioallantois (45 days, 4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and post-partum) and endometrium (4 months, 6 months, 10 months, 11 months, and diestrus) throughout gestation, then looked in-depth at transcripts related to steroid synthesis, conjugation, transportation, and signaling. Key findings include: 1) differential expression of HSD17B isoforms among tissues (HSD17B1 high in the chorioallantois, while HSD17B2 is the dominant form in the endometrium) 2) a novel isoform with homology to SULT1A1 is the predominant sulfotransferase transcript in the chorioallantois; and 3) nuclear estrogen (ESR1, ESR2) and progesterone (PGR) expression is minimal to nonexistant in the chorioallantois and pregnant endometrium. Additionally, several hypotheses have been formed, including the possibility that the 45-day chorioallantois is able to synthesize steroids de novo from acetate and that horses utilize glucuronidation to clear estrogens from the endometrium during estrous, but not during pregnancy. In summary, these findings represent an in-depth look at equine steroid-related transcripts through gestation, providing novel hypotheses and future directions for equine endocrine research.","publish_time":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loux, S C; Conley, A J; Scoggin, K E; El-Sheikh Ali, H; Dini, P; Ball, B A","journal":"Reproduction","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-20-0015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408268/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["months","equine steroid-related transcripts","steroid synthesis","Steroid production","day chorioallantois","equine pregnancy","holistic view of steroid","circulating steroid profile","pregnant endometrium","gestation","novel hypotheses","species","equine endocrine research","in-depth look","novel isoform","Key findings","distinct pattern of steroids","differential expression of HSD17B isoforms","tissues","future directions","transporters","SULT1A1","steroidogenic enzymes","nonexistant","HSD17B1 high","ESR2","horses","progesterone","PGR","homology","glucuronidation","clear estrogens","predominant sulfotransferase transcript","ESR1","novo","acetate","receptors","nuclear estrogen","HSD17B2","conjugation","post-partum","dominant form","individual physiological requirements","transportation","differences","diestrus","days","summary","possibility","factors","steroidogenesis","result"],"language":"en"},

These travelers can be exposed to (multi) resistant microorganisms, may become colonized, and bring them back home. This systematic review aims to identify the carriage rates of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales (MDR-E) among returning travelers, to identify microbiological methods used, and to identify the leading risk factors for acquiring MDR-E during international travel. METHODS Articles related to our research question were identified through a literature search in multiple databases (until June 18, 2019) - Embase, Medline Ovid, Cochrane, Scopus, Cinahl, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. RESULTS Out of 3211 potentially relevant articles, we included 22 studies in the systematic review, and 12 studies in 7 random-effects meta-analyses. Highest carriage rates of MDR-E were observed after travel to Southern Asia (median 71%), followed by travel to Northern Africa (median 42%). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) were identified in 5 out of 22 studies, from a few patients. However, in only eight out of 22 studies (36.4%) the initial laboratory method targeted detection of the presence of CPE in the original samples. The risk factor with the highest pooled odds ratio (OR) for MDR-E was travel to Southern Asia (pooled OR = 14.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.50 to 36.45), followed by antibiotic use during travel (pooled OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.76 to 4.39). CONCLUSIONS Risk of acquiring MDR-E while travelling increases depending on travel destination and if antibiotics are used during travel. This information is useful for the development of guidelines for healthcare facilities with low MDR-E prevalence rates to prevent admission of carriers without appropriate measures. The impact of such guidelines should be assessed.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voor In \u0027t Holt, Anne F; Mourik, Kees; Beishuizen, Berend; van der Schoor, Adri\u00EBnne S; Verbon, Annelies; Vos, Margreet C; Severin, Juli\u00EBtte A","journal":"Antimicrobial resistance and infection control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-020-00733-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern Asia","Northern Africa"],"keyphrases":["international travel","studies","travel destination","CONCLUSIONS Risk of acquiring MDR-E","low MDR-E prevalence rates","Highest carriage rates of MDR","carriage rates of multidrug","resistant Enterobacterales","Southern Asia","METHODS Articles","systematic review","highest pooled odds ratio","leading risk factors","presence of CPE","development of guidelines","resistant microorganisms","returning travelers","microbiological methods","relevant articles","BACKGROUND International tourism","healthcare facilities","Cochrane","Scopus","Web of Science","admission of carriers","initial laboratory method targeted detection","Cinahl","increases","literature search","Medline Ovid","research question","random-effects meta-analyses","multiple databases","Google Scholar","Embase","appropriate measures","original samples","confidence interval","Northern Africa","antibiotic use","antibiotics","tourist arrivals","information","Carbapenemase","impact","patients"],"language":"en"},

The government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement of people as a preventive measure. This survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India. Methods An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes. At the time of taking the survey, 72.5% of the respondents (913/1260) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown. Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement. The proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes, government and municipal hospitals (126/253;49.8%) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher (P \u003C 0.0001) than those in private practice (174/775;22.4%). Apart from emergencies such as trauma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis (81.8%), other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections (9.1%) and cataract surgeries (5.9%). Approximately, 77.5% (976/1260) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began. In addition, 59.1% (745/1260) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients. When asked about the resumption of practice upon easing off of the restrictions, 57.8% (728/1260) of the respondents said they were unsure of when to resume elective surgeries; furthermore, 62.8% (791/1260) were unsure about the preferred screening strategy or precautionary approach prior to resuming surgeries and were awaiting guidelines. Conclusion Our survey shows that majority of ophthalmologists in India were not seeing patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, with near-total cessation of elective surgeries. Emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5% of ophthalmologists who responded.

To prevent recurrence, it is important to use the appropriate mesh size based on the size of the myopectineal orifice (MPO), which is the weak area of the abdominal wall where inguinal hernias occur. We aimed to estimate the appropriate mesh size for groin hernias by investigating MPO size. METHODS Four hundred and six patients underwent groin hernia repair using a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach at the Zeze Hospital between July 2009 and December 2017. We investigated patients\u0027 backgrounds, MPO components dimensions, and hernia recurrence, and evaluated the appropriate mesh size. RESULTS The 359 male and 47 female patients had an average age of 63 \u00B1 15 years. In 171, 147, and 88 cases, hernias were localized to the right, left, and bilaterally, respectively. The number of lateral, medial, femoral, and combined hernias was 317, 124, 11, and 42, respectively. The 95th percentile for the horizontal and vertical lengths in cases of hernia orifice \u2265 3 cm were 9.6 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively, while it was 9.2 cm and 6.4 cm in cases of hernia orifice \u003C 3 cm. We added 2 cm and 3 cm to the 95th percentile for the length and width of the MPO, resulting in 13.2 \u00D7 10.4 cm and 15.6 \u00D7 13.0 cm in cases with hernia orifice \u003C 3 cm and \u2265 3 cm, respectively. Relapse after TEP occurred in 1 patient (0.2%). CONCLUSION The appropriate mesh size for TEP repair, derived from intraoperative MPO measurements, was estimated as 13.2 \u00D7 10.4 cm and 15.6 \u00D7 13.0 cm when the hernia orifice was \u003C 3 cm and \u2265 3 cm, respectively. Using appropriate mesh sizes based on MPO measurement may reduce groin hernia recurrence after TEP.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hiratsuka, Takahiro; Shigemitsu, Yuji; Etoh, Tsuyoshi; Kono, Yohei; Suzuki, Kosuke; Zeze, Kenji; Inomata, Masafumi","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07616-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MPO size","cases of hernia orifice","groin hernia recurrence","groin hernia repair","possible groin hernia","groin hernias","appropriate mesh sizes","TEP repair","myopectineal orifice","MPO components dimensions","intraoperative MPO measurements","inguinal hernias","combined hernias","percentile","weak area","female patients","important risk factor","vertical lengths","abdominal wall","extraperitoneal","average age","approach","patients\u0027 backgrounds","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND Insufficient coverage","number of lateral","Zeze Hospital","width","years","Relapse","METHODS","right"],"language":"en"},

BACKGROUND COVID-19 is an infection caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The first reported case happened in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. At present, at least 1.8 million people are infected around the world and almost 110,000 people have died. Many studies have analyzed the clinical picture of COVID-19, but they are focused on respiratory symptoms and headache is generically treated. METHODS I describe and discuss my headaches during my COVID-19 and I review the MEDLINE literature about headaches and COVID-19. RESULTS More than 41,000 COVID-19 patients have been included in clinical studies and headache was present in 8%-12% of them. However, no headache characterization was made in these studies. As a headache expert and based on my own personal clinical case, headaches related to COVID-19 can be classified in the 2 phases of the disease. Acute headache attributed to systemic viral infection, primary cough headache, tension-type headache and headache attributed to heterophoria can appear in the first phase (the influenza-like phase); and headache attributed to hypoxia and a new headache, difficult to fit into the ICHD3, can appear if the second phase (the cytokine storm phase) occurs. CONCLUSIONS Several headaches can appear during COVID-19 infection. All of them are headaches specified in the ICHD3, except 1 that occurs from the 7th day after the clinical onset. This headache is probably related to the cytokine storm that some patients suffer and it could be framed under the ICHD3 headache of Headache attributed to other non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease. Although the reported prevalence of headaches as a symptom of COVID-19 infection is low, this experience shows that, very probably, it is underestimated.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belvis, Robert","journal":"Headache","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/head.13841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["ICHD3 headache of Headache","new headache","Acute headache","headache expert","headache characterization","primary cough headache","tension-type headache","symptom of COVID","BACKGROUND COVID","clinical picture of COVID","clinical studies","reported prevalence of headaches","personal clinical case","cytokine storm phase","clinical onset","reported case","personal case experience","systemic viral infection","patients","present","people","new coronavirus SARS-CoV","non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease","hypoxia","heterophoria","MEDLINE literature","world","day","Wuhan","respiratory symptoms","influenza","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS","phases","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate current guidelines for tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a framework for health systems to prepare as the science evolves over the upcoming months and years. METHODS Literature review was performed. Articles reporting clinical practice guidelines for tracheostomy in the context of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS A total of thirteen tracheotomy guidelines were identified. Two were available via PubMed, five in society or organization websites, and six identified via health system websites or other sources. Five were from Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery specialties, six from Anesthesiology and one from Pulmonary/Critical Care. All (100%) studies recommended postponing elective OR cases in COVID-19 positive patients, while seven recommended reducing team members to only essential staff and three recommended forming a designated tracheostomy team.

Corticosteroids may diminish the inflammatory response, a major factor for lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome in viral respiratory tract infection.

Socioeconomic status (SES) also significantly influences eating behaviors, and low SES is associated with increased risk for obesity. However, little is known regarding the relationship between snacking behavior and SES among adolescents and how this may contribute to obesity-related outcomes. The primary objective of this scoping review was to review the literature to assess and characterize the relationship between SES and snacking in adolescents. The secondary objective was to assess weight-related outcomes and their relation to snacking habits. Included articles were published between January 2000 and May 2019; written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish; and focused on adolescents (13-17 years). In total, 14 bibliographic databases were searched, and seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Preliminary evidence from the seven included studies suggests a weak but potential link between SES and snacking.

With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention. Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results. For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Ying; Chang, Le; Wang, Lunan","journal":"Reviews in medical virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","SARS","RNA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV epidemics","pathogenesis of SARS","accurate laboratory testing of SARS","early reporting","early treatment","early quarantine","early discovery","serological tests","NAT","blood samples","paired samples","false-negative results","serological diagnostic assays","positive rate","high-quality results","diverse assays","epidemic transmission","nucleic acid tests","lower respiratory tract specimens","specimen collection","different antigens","variety of molecular","human RNase P gene","stool","inhibition controls","later periods of illness","infectious diseases","template volume","guidelines","reagents","antibody test","global public concerns","Wuhan","China","articles","guanidine salt","sensitivity of detection","outbreak of unknown pneumonia","beta-CoVs","new coronavirus","medical importance","genome structure","summary","tremendous attention","review","suggestions"],"language":"en"},

There is still insufficient understanding of how it occurs and whether it is due to the sphincter length, relaxation, or pressure differences. Aim This study evaluates the effect on the lower esophageal sphincter of the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) technique applied in surgery in cases of morbid obesity using ambulatory 24-h pH monitoring (APM) and esophageal manometry (EM). Material and methods A retrospective examination was carried out on the APM and EM tests performed preoperatively and postoperatively in cases of LSG. The parameters examined were the body mass index (BMI), amplitude pressure of the esophagus (AP), total length of the lower esophageal segment (LESL), resting pressure of the LES (LESP), residual pressure of the LES (LESR), relaxation time of the LES, intragastric pressure, and the DeMeester score. Results A total of 62 cases with available data were evaluated. A statistically significant difference was determined between the preoperative values and the 3-month postoperative values of BMI, LESP, and relaxation time of the LES. A statistically significant increase was determined in the DeMeester score, and the increase in the total number of reflux episodes longer than 5 min was found to be the most responsible for this increase. No significant difference was determined in the other parameters. Conclusions The LSG was found to cause a reduction in LESP, and an increase in acid reflux causing an extended relaxation time of the LES. This was confirmed by the increase seen in the DeMeester score.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gemici, Eyup; Kones, Osman; Seyit, Hakan; Surek, Ahmet; Cikot, Murat; Bozkurt, Mehmet Abdussamet; Alis, Halil","journal":"Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2019.83198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32117496/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EM","LSG","LES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant increase","amplitude pressure","intragastric pressure","LESP","residual pressure","pressure differences","cases of LSG","DeMeester score","extended relaxation time","total length","significant difference","lower esophageal sphincter","lower esophageal segment","esophageal manometry","acid reflux","sphincter length","APM","total number of reflux episodes","parameters","laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy","Introduction Gastroesophageal reflux","cases of morbid obesity","month postoperative values of BMI","preoperative values","EM tests","h pH monitoring","major problem","technique","body mass index","surgery","esophagus","effect","LESL","LESR","retrospective examination","Material","methods","available data","reduction","study","insufficient understanding","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Stool samples from seven children and 13 teachers were tested for rotavirus and norovirus. During the investigation stool samples were collected and sent in cold chain to the laboratory. The samples were subjected to rotavirus enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcription PCR for norovirus. All samples were negative for rotavirus but positive for norovirus. To determine the genogroup and genotype of norovirus, nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons was performed. All norovirus from the outbreak was of genotype GII.2[16]. To determine the relatedness of the strains phylogenetic analysis was done using neighbor-joining method. Phylogenetically these strains were highly related to GII.2[P16] noroviruses from China and Japan.

When feasible, surgical removal remains the primary treatment strategy; nevertheless, local RCC relapse management is controversial, and less invasive procedures may represent an attractive option to achieve oncologic control. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of image-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) for RCC local recurrence in patients initially treated with nephrectomy with curative intent. 10 consecutive patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous MWA of a total of 10 retroperitoneal nodules. Inclusion criteria were: histologically verified retroperitoneal metastases, previous radical nephrectomy, lesion no larger than 3 cm, no other metastatic site elsewhere. All the procedures were performed under moderate sedation choosing the most favorable patient decubitus. If deemed necessary, pneumodissection was induced before ablation. After the antenna placement inside the target lesion, thermal ablation was achieved by maintenance of a power of 100 W for a total time between 2 and 4 min. All patients were observed overnight and discharged the following day if clinically stable. Technical success was obtained in 100% of patients. One patient was re-treated to complete oncologic response with repeat MWA. No major complications were observed. No patients demonstrated local recurrence at a mean follow-up of 26 months. MWA is a safe and effective treatment strategy for loco-regional relapse of RCC following radical nephrectomy. This technique may represent a valuable approach for patients who are not eligible for surgery.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ierardi, Anna Maria; Carnevale, Aldo; Rossi, Umberto G; Renzulli, Matteo; Garanzini, Enrico; Golfieri, Rita; Macchione, Nicola; Cittanti, Corrado; Giganti, Melchiore; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo","journal":"Medical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-020-01354-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166412/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RCC","MWA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RCC local recurrence","consecutive patients","percutaneous MWA","local RCC relapse management","previous radical nephrectomy","repeat MWA","loco-regional relapse of RCC","percutaneous microwave ablation","thermal ablation","primary treatment strategy","effective treatment strategy","retroperitoneal metastases","oncologic control","invasive procedures","retroperitoneal nodules","target lesion","total time","following day","complete oncologic response","favorable patient decubitus","clinical outcomes of image","attractive option","surgical removal","Renal cell carcinoma","moderate sedation","mean follow-up","feasibility","safety","maintenance","antenna placement","valuable approach","power","Inclusion criteria","curative intent","study","technique","months","pneumodissection","surgery","metastatic site","Technical success","major complications","aim"],"language":"en"},

As part of the worldwide response, many molecular diagnostic platforms have been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Our objective was to evaluate three sample-to-answer molecular diagnostic platforms (Cepheid Xpert\u00AE Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [Xpert Xpress], Abbott ID NOW\u2122 COVID-19 [ID NOW], GenMark ePlex\u00AE SARS-CoV-2 Test [ePlex]) to determine analytical sensitivity, clinical performance, and workflow for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from 108 symptomatic patients. We found that the Xpert Xpress had the lowest limit of detection (100% detection at 100 copies/mL), followed by the ePlex (100% detection at 1,000 copies/mL), and the ID NOW (20,000 copies/mL). The Xpert Xpress also had highest positive percent agreement (PPA) when compared to our reference standard (98.3%) followed by the ePlex (91.4%) and ID now (87.7%). All three assays showed 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). In the workflow analysis, the ID NOW produced the most rapid time to result per specimen (\u223C17 minutes) as compared to the Xpert Xpress (\u223C46 minutes) and the ePlex (\u223C1.5 hours), but what the ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance. The ePlex had the longest time to results and showed a slight improvement in PPA over the ID NOW. Information about the clinical and analytical performance of these assays, as well as workflow, will be critical in making informed and timely decisions on testing platform.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhen, Wei; Smith, Elizabeth; Manji, Ryhana; Schron, Deborah; Berry, Gregory J","journal":"Journal of clinical microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00783-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32332061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Food and Drug Administration","FDA","Abbott ID","Xpert Xpress","ID","PPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Xpress SARS-CoV","Xpert Xpress","detection of SARS","Abbott ID","GenMark ePlex","Cepheid Xpert","analytical performance","clinical performance","copies","molecular diagnostic platforms","analytical sensitivity","PPA","positive patients","lowest limit of detection","assays","rapid time","workflow analysis","minutes","rapid results","highest positive percent agreement","negative percent agreement","symptomatic patients","longest time","Emergency Use Authorization","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","timely decisions","Food","EUA","FDA","nasopharyngeal swabs","testing platform","Drug Administration","worldwide response","slight improvement","sample","NPA","specimen","Information","COVID","hours","reference standard","objective","globe"],"language":"en"},

Sound preparation is required during pre-registration nursing education to enable student nurses to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent and control healthcare-associated infection and promote patient safety. Few studies have explored nursing students\u0027 education and training in aseptic technique. OBJECTIVES To investigate what, when and how pre-registration nursing students are taught aseptic technique and how they are assessed in undergraduate, pre-registration nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. DESIGN National cross-sectional survey exploring preparation to undertake aseptic technique in pre-registration nursing curricula in the United Kingdom. SETTING Universities providing undergraduate, pre-registration adult nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS Nurse educators. METHODS Structured telephone interviews were conducted with nurse educators. Descriptive and inferential statistical data analyses were undertaken. RESULTS Response rate was 70% (n = 49/70). A variety of different learning and teaching methods were reported to be in use. Teaching in relation to aseptic technique took place in conjunction with teaching in relation to different clinical procedures rather than placing emphasis on the principles of asepsis per se and how to transfer them to different procedures and situations. Wide variation in teaching time; use of multiple guidelines; inaccuracy in the principles identified by educators as taught to students; and limited opportunity for regular, criteria based competency assessment were apparent across programmes. CONCLUSIONS Pre-registration preparation in relation to aseptic technique requires improvement. There is a need to develop a working definition of aseptic technique. The generalisability of these findings in other healthcare students needs to be explored.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hawker, Clare; Courtenay, Molly; Wigglesworth, Neil; Gould, Dinah","journal":"Nurse education today","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DESIGN National"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-registration nursing programmes","pre-registration nursing students","pre-registration nursing education","pre-registration nursing curricula","BACKGROUND Aseptic technique","pre-registration adult nursing programmes","CONCLUSIONS Pre-registration preparation","working definition of aseptic technique","nursing students\u0027 education","relation","core nursing skill","teaching methods","United Kingdom","teaching time","healthcare students","different procedures","Sound preparation","different clinical procedures","PARTICIPANTS Nurse educators","use","variety of different learning","principles of asepsis","control healthcare-associated infection","METHODS Structured telephone interviews","criteria","student nurses","conjunction","place","competency assessment","multiple guidelines","emphasis","training","DESIGN National cross-sectional survey","skills necessary","limited opportunity","SETTING Universities","inferential statistical data analyses","knowledge","inaccuracy","patient safety","Wide variation","findings","studies","improvement","RESULTS Response rate","need","generalisability","situations","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

The guideline was prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and according to GRADE methodology.

Overall, we strongly recommend using prothrombin complex over no treatment and fresh-frozen plasma in patients on VKA plus vitamin K. We further strongly recommend using idarucizumab in patients on dabigatran and make a recommendation for andexanet alfa in patients on rivaroxaban and apixaban over no treatment. We make a weak recommendation on using high-dose prothrombin complex concentrate (50 IU/kg) for all patients taking edoxaban and for patients on rivaroxaban or apixaban in case andexanet alfa is not available.

Loss of pulsatile brain perfusion, however, has been implicated in neurological complications. Furthermore, the adverse effects of absent pulsatility on the cerebral microcirculation are modulated similarly as CO2 vasoreactivity in resistance vessels. During support with an extracorporeal assist device swings in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressures (PaCO2) that determine cerebral oxygen delivery are not uncommon-especially when CO2 is eliminated by the respirator as well as via the gas exchanger of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine. We, therefore, investigated whether non-pulsatile flow affects cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity (CVR) and regional brain oxygenation (rSO2). METHODS In this prospective, single-centre case-control trial, we studied 32 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAv) as well as rSO2 was determined during step changes of PaCO2 between 30, 40, and 50 mmHg. Measurements were conducted on cardiopulmonary bypass during non-pulsatile and postoperatively under pulsatile blood flow at comparable test conditions. Corresponding changes of CVR and concomitant rSO2 alterations were determined for each flow mode. Each patient served as her own control. RESULTS MCAv was generally lower during hypocapnia than during normocapnia and hypercapnia (p \u003C 0.0001). However, the MCAv/PaCO2 slope during non-pulsatile flow was 14.4 cm/s/mmHg [CI 11.8-16.9] and 10.4 cm/s/mmHg [CI 7.9-13.0] after return of pulsatility (p = 0.03). During hypocapnia, non-pulsatile CVR (4.3 \u00B1 1.7%/mmHg) was higher than pulsatile CVR (3.1 \u00B1 1.3%/mmHg, p = 0.01). Independent of the flow mode, we observed a decline in rSO2 during hypocapnia and a corresponding rise during hypercapnia (p \u003C 0.0001). However, the relationship between \u0394rSO2 and \u0394MCAv was less pronounced during non-pulsatile flow. CONCLUSIONS Non-pulsatile perfusion is associated with enhanced cerebrovascular CVR resulting in greater relative decreases of cerebral blood flow during hypocapnia. Heterogenic microvascular perfusion may account for the attenuated \u0394rSO2/\u0394MCAv slope. Potential hazards related to this altered regulation of cerebral perfusion still need to be assessed.

To enhance the therapeutic potential of curcumin against heart failure, we produced a series of synthetic curcumin analogues and investigated their inhibitory activity against p300-HAT. The compound with the strongest activity was further evaluated to determine its effects on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice. We synthesised five synthetic curcumin analogues and found that a compound we have named GO-Y030 most strongly inhibited p300-HAT activity. Furthermore, 1 \u03BCM GO-Y030, in a manner equivalent to 10 \u00B5M curcumin, suppressed phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic responses in cultured cardiomyocytes. In mice undergoing transverse aortic constriction surgery, administration of GO-Y030 at a mere 1% of an equivalently-effective dose of curcumin significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction. In addition, this low dose of GO-Y030 almost completely blocked histone H3K9 acetylation and eliminated left ventricular fibrosis. A low dose of the synthetic curcumin analogue GO-Y030 effectively inhibits p300-HAT activity and markedly suppresses the development of heart failure in mice.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shimizu, Kana; Sunagawa, Yoichi; Funamoto, Masafumi; Wakabayashi, Hiroki; Genpei, Mai; Miyazaki, Yusuke; Katanasaka, Yasufumi; Sari, Nurmila; Shimizu, Satoshi; Katayama, Ayumi; Shibata, Hiroyuki; Iwabuchi, Yoshiharu; Kakeya, Hideaki; Wada, Hiromichi; Hasegawa, Koji; Morimoto, Tatsuya","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64207-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Y030","\u00B5M curcumin","effective dose of curcumin","inhibited p300-HAT activity","development of heart failure","series of synthetic curcumin analogues","therapeutic potential of curcumin","mice","p300-histone acetyltransferase","cardiomyocyte hypertrophy","inhibitory activity","low dose","strongest activity","pressure overload-induced heart failure","cardiac hypertrophy","compound","blocked histone H3K9 acetylation","suppressed phenylephrine","hypertrophic responses","transverse aortic constriction surgery","administration","experimental animal models","manner equivalent","effects","cultured cardiomyocytes","ventricular fibrosis","systolic dysfunction","addition","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

The arsenal of drugs available is limited, and prolonged use of such drugs makes parasite to become resistant. Therefore, it is very imperative to develop a safe, cost-effective and inexpensive vaccine against VL. Although in recent years many strategies have been pursued by researchers, but so far only some of the vaccine candidates reached for clinical trial and more than half of them are still in pipeline. There is now a broad consent among Leishmania researchers that the perseverance of parasite is very essential for eliciting a protective immune response and may perhaps be attained by live attenuated parasite vaccination. For making a live attenuated parasite it is very essential to ensure that the parasite is deficient of virulence and should further study genetically modified parasites to perceive the mechanism of pathogenesis. So it is believed that in the near future, a complete understanding of the Leishmania genome will explore clear strategies to discover a novel vaccine. This review describes the need for a genetically modified live attenuated vaccine against VL, and obstacles associated with its development.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pandey, Satish Chandra; Kumar, Awanish; Samant, Mukesh","journal":"Parasite immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leishmania"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["perseverance of parasite","attenuated vaccine","live attenuated parasite vaccination","VL","protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani","Leishmania researchers","inexpensive vaccine","vaccine candidates","novel vaccine","Leishmania genome","clear strategies","modified parasites","arsenal of drugs available","population of tropical","complete understanding","prolonged use","subtropical regions","study","clinical trial","obstacles","broad consent","deficient of virulence","half","globe","near future","protective immune response","mechanism of pathogenesis","recent years","need","Visceral leishmaniasis","review","pipeline","development"],"language":"en"},

This essay considers four main challenges into which veterinarians are increasingly being drawn, as they respond to increasing public expectation for them to be scientific and moral authorities in animal welfare in addition to their traditional role as trusted health experts. They include: (1) to go beyond traditional conceptions of health by adopting a holistic view that also considers animal welfare, not only disease treatment; (2) to reimagine their professional duties when it comes to disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) to develop core competencies/proficiency in animal welfare science and ethics in order to navigate discourses concerning competing priorities and socio-political ideologies and to provide professional leadership in animal welfare; (4) to provide feedback on novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions and their impact on animals\u0027 welfare. To competently navigate the intricacies of the socio-political and connected world as trusted authorities and conduits for innovation in and through animal welfare, veterinarians and veterinary students are encouraged to: (a) develop core competencies in veterinary ethics, animal welfare science and deliberative capacities that are well-informed by current multidisciplinary frameworks, such as One Health; (b) engage interested parties in more effective collaboration and ethical decision-making in order to address animal welfare related concerns within their immediate sphere of influence (e.g., in a given community); and (c) participate in the process of engineering and technological design that incorporates animals\u0027 welfare data (such as their preferences) for real-time animal monitoring through adding animal scientific and values-aware evidence in information technology systems.

Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, surgical societies have recommended that procedures with a high risk of aerosolization be avoided or delayed. However, some high-risk procedures, such as those related to head and neck malignancies, cannot always be delayed. Care must be taken during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize viral transmission as much as possible. Preoperative testing for COVID-19, limited operating room personnel, adequate personal protective equipment, and surgical technique are factors to consider for high-risk procedures. Methods: This article presents the case of an awake tracheotomy performed for a transglottic mass causing airway obstruction. Results: With detailed planning and specific techniques, the amount of aerosolization was reduced, and the procedure was performed as safely as possible.

These data were used to train different machine learning models (k-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, etc). Implanted lens characteristics and biometric data were used as input to predict IOL power and refractive outcomes. For external validation, a dataset of 52 eyes was used. The accuracy of the trained models was compared with that of the power formulas Holladay 2, Haigis, Barrett Universal II, and Hill-RBF v2.0. RESULTS The SD of the prediction error in order of lowest to highest was the new method (designated Karmona) (0.30), Haigis (0.36), Holladay 2 (0.38), Barrett Universal II (0.38), and Hill-RBF v2.0 (0.40).

This has in-turn led to understaffed hospitals unable to handle new patient influx. To help alleviate these problems, we design and develop a contactless patient positioning system that can enable scanning patients in a completely remote and contactless fashion. Our key design objective is to reduce the physical contact time with a patient as much as possible, which we achieve with our contactless workflow. Our system comprises automated calibration, positioning, and multi-view synthesis components that enable patient scan without physical proximity. Our calibration routine ensures system calibration at all times and can be executed without any manual intervention. Our patient positioning routine comprises a novel robust dynamic fusion (RDF) algorithm for accurate 3D patient body modeling. With its multi-modal inference capability, RDF can be trained once and used across different applications (without re-training) having various sensor choices, a key feature to enable system deployment at scale. Our multi-view synthesizer ensures multi-view positioning visualization for the technician to verify positioning accuracy prior to initiating the patient scan. We conduct extensive experiments with publicly available and proprietary datasets to demonstrate efficacy. Our system has already been used, and had a positive impact on, hospitals and technicians on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to see its use increase substantially globally.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karanam, Srikrishna; Li, Ren; Yang, Fan; Hu, Wei; Chen, Terrence; Wu, Ziyan","journal":"IEEE transactions on medical imaging","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.2991954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contactless patient positioning system","patient positioning routine","patient scan","system calibration","multi-view positioning visualization","positioning accuracy","new patient influx","system deployment","D patient body modeling","calibration routine","multi-view synthesizer","multi-view synthesis components","RDF","automated calibration","pandemic","contactless fashion","contactless workflow","key design objective","key feature","physical proximity","ongoing COVID","understaffed hospitals unable","physical contact time","algorithm","novel robust dynamic fusion","re-training","various sensor choices","virus","medical professionals","scanning patients","proprietary datasets","global shortage of personal protective equipment","high risk","healthcare systems","technicians","lines","extensive experiments","contagious SARS-CoV","efficacy","different applications","multi-modal inference capability","positive impact","scale","times","manual intervention","problems","use"],"language":"en"},

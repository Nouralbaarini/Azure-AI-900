The appropriate screening strategy for IA in these patients remains undefined, particularly in the setting of nosocomial outbreaks. We describe our experience employing chest computed tomography (CT) scans as a screening method for IA. In addition, we comment on antimicrobial prophylaxis in HTRs in the setting of an outbreak. METHODS: Screening CT scans of the chest and serum galactomannan (GM) were performed in HTRs during an outbreak that followed the index case of IA. Abnormal CT findings prompted a diagnostic workup. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for new transplants recipients included intravenous micafungin while hospitalized, followed by outpatient inhaled amphotericin B for up to 3 months. RESULTS: During a 10\u2010month period, five cases of IA were identified among HTRs. Two additional asymptomatic patients were diagnosed with IA among 15 asymptomatic HTRs who underwent screening chest CT scans. Among the five cases of IA in HTRs, two of five (40%) had a partial response and the other three failed voriconazole therapy. Complete response to voriconazole therapy assessed at 12 weeks was achieved in these two asymptomatic HTRs diagnosed via screening CTs. Serum GM was positive only in one of the symptomatic cases. The negative predictive value of CT scans was 100% (95% confidence interval, 71.5%\u2010100%). CONCLUSIONS: In an outbreak setting, screening CT scans of the chest may aid in early detection of asymptomatic HTRs with IA and improve outcome.","publish_time":"2017-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kabbani, Dima; Goldraich, Livia; Ross, Heather; Rotstein, Coleman; Husain, Shahid","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02a00e8886d61aa7a24f7a40e01b6b39b4eaf45f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169681.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29125713/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IA.

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly associated with respiratory tract disease but have been implicated in enteric disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of coronaviruses in stool samples from children and adults with gastrointestinal illness by RT-PCR. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical samples submitted for infectious diarrhea testing were collected from December 2007 through March 2008. RNA extraction and RT-PCR was performed for stools negative for Clostridium difficile using primer sets against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. Clinical data from samples positive for coronaviruses were reviewed and recorded. RESULTS: Samples from 479 patients were collected including 151 pediatric (\u003C= 18yrs), and 328 adults (\u003E 18yrs). Of these samples, 4 patients (1.3%, 2 adult; 2 pediatric) screened positive for the presence of a coronavirus. All detected coronaviruses were identified as HCoV-HKU1. No stools screened positive for either HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-OC43. All HCoV-HKU1 positive samples occurred between mid January to mid February. Clinical manifestations from HCoV-HKU1 positive patients included diarrhea, emesis and respiratory complaints. Three (75%) patients were admitted to the hospital with a median length of stay of 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Coronaviruses as a group are not commonly identified in stool samples of patients presenting with gastrointestinal illness. HCoV-HKU1 can be identified in stool samples from children and adults with gastrointestinal disease, with most individuals having respiratory findings as well. No stool samples screened positive for HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, or HCoV-OC43.","publish_time":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esper, Frank; Ou, Zhen; Huang, Yung T.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82e1c9521e6cc3d5d2d62cf281e5e1f1400e4951.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a47f6b009dd1bde67c0966c63ef637723c7b30e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2864800.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210001034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20362494/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210001034; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.03.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-NL63","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-HKU1 positive samples","HCoV-HKU1 positive patients","samples positive","Clinical samples","stool samples of patients","gastrointestinal disease","frequency of coronaviruses","Human coronaviruses","detected coronaviruses","adults","respiratory tract disease","enteric disease","gastrointestinal illness","respiratory complaints","respiratory findings","children","Clinical manifestations","Clinical data","RT-PCR","stools","yrs","infectious diarrhea testing","variety of illnesses","emesis","numerous animal species","primer","BACKGROUND","Clostridium difficile","individuals","STUDY DESIGN","median length","RNA extraction","hospital","presence","group","days","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

The sensitivities of both tests were then compared. For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated. Results A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT. Using rRT-PCR, 30 patients were tested positive, with 6 cases initially missed.

The HIV lipidome shows a remarkable enrichment in dihydrosphingomyelin, an unusual sphingolipid formed by a dihydrosphingosine backbone. Here we investigated the ability of dihydrosphingosine to incorporate into the site of membrane fusion mediated by the HIV envelope (Env) protein. Dihydrosphingosine as well as cholesterol, fatty acid, and tocopherol was conjugated to highly conserved, short HIV-1 Env-derived peptides with no antiviral activity otherwise. We showed that dihydrosphingosine exclusively endowed nanomolar antiviral activity to the peptides (IC(50) as low as 120 nM) in HIV-1 infection on TZM-bl cells and on Jurkat T cells, as well as in the cell-cell fusion assay. These sphingopeptides were active against enfuvirtide-resistant and wild-type CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV strains. The anti-HIV activity was determined by both the peptides and their dihydrosphingosine conjugate. Moreover, their mode of action involved accumulation in the cells and viruses and binding to membranes enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. The data suggest that sphingopeptides are recruited to the HIV membrane fusion site and provide a general concept in developing inhibitors of sphingolipid-mediated biological systems.\u2014Ashkenazi, A., Viard, M., Unger, L., Blumenthal, R., Shai, Y.

All children were tested by faecal culture, latex agglutination and electron microscopy. A total of 832 children were included in the study. An aetiological agent was detected in 788 children (94.6 %). A bacterial aetiology was found in 22 (2.6 %) children and bacterial\u2013viral co-infection was found in 146 (17.6 %) patients. The most frequent causative agents of gastroenteritis in children were viruses, which were detected in 620 (74.5 %) patients. The main causes of viral gastroenteritis were rotaviruses (detected in 410 children), followed by caliciviruses (42), coronaviruses (28), adenoviruses (19) and astroviruses (14). Dual viral infections were detected in 107 children, with rotavirus\u2013calicivirus co-infection being the most common.

In 2002, Thailand began active, population-based surveillance for radiographically confirmed pneumonia in Sa Kaeo Province. Methods Full-time surveillance officers conducted active case ascertainment at every hospital, and routine audits and a community cluster survey promoted complete and accurate reporting. A case of pneumonia was defined as acute infection with signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and evidence of new infiltrates. An independent panel of radiologists reviewed digital images of all radiographs. Results Between September 2002 and August 2003, 777 patients met the case definition. The measured minimum incidence was 177/100000 but the estimated incidence was as high as 580/100000 with full adjustment for incomplete chest radiography and access to health care. Seventy-two (9%) patients died and 28% were known to be HIV positive. Fifteen (2%) patients had pneumonia twice during the year. The average cost of hospitalization for an episode of pneumonia ranged from US$490.80 to $628.60. Conclusions Pneumonia is a significant and costly public health problem in Thailand.

The aim of this study was to report the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants in the treatment of cases with an upper respiratory tract infection. Materials and methods A double blind randomized controlled trial was implemented between October 2013 and February 2014. An essential-oil extract of Cretan aromatic plants in olive oil (total volume of 15ml of essential oil per litre of olive oil) was administered as 0.5ml soft gel capsules, twice a day, for 7 days. Placebo treatment was 0.5ml olive oil in soft gel capsules. Eligible patients were those presenting for clinical examination in the selected setting with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that had begun within the previous 24hours. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses. The primary outcome was the severity and duration of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-21) questionnaire. A secondary outcome of interest was the change in C-reactive protein (CRP) status. Results One hundred and five patients completed the study: 51 in the placebo group, and 54 in the intervention (treated) group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found in symptom duration or severity between the two groups, although small and clinically favorable effects were observed. When the analysis was restricted to subjects with a laboratory-documented viral infection, the percentage of patients with cessation of symptoms after 6 days of treatment was 91% in the intervention group and 70% in the control group (p=0.089). At baseline, one third of the patients in each group had elevated CRP levels. At follow-up, the respective proportions were 0% in the intervention group and 15% in the placebo group (p=0.121). The data were also in a favorable direction when 50% and 80% symptom reduction points were considered for specific virus types. Conclusions Compared with placebo the essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants provided no detectable statistically significant benefit or harm in the patients with upper respiratory illness, although descriptive differences were identified in favorable direction mainly in the virus-positive population.","publish_time":"2015-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duijker, G.; Bertsias, A.; Symvoulakis, E.

Methods We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Results The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74] vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared. Conclusions Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality. Inflammatory factor cascade and coagulation abnormality may be the potential mechanisms of COVID-19 combined with cardiac injury.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Hua; Zhang, Lin; Huang, Bin; Zhu, Muxin; Zhou, Yong; Zhang, Huan; Tao, Xiaogen; Cheng, Shaohui; Yu, Wenhu; Zhu, Liping; Chen, Jian","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de366400a7c0515e71f1dbde343d670608d0911f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303313?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437935/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303313","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Increased hs-TnI level","elevated hs-TnI levels","hs-Troponin","non-survivors","admission","potential mechanisms of COVID","early stage of COVID","SD","patients","Death risk","Conclusions Cardiac injury","coagulation abnormality","coagulation index","Inflammatory factor","laboratory test results","intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital","shorter duration","independent predictive relationship","interleukin","higher C-reactive protein","average age","underlying diseases","severe lymphopenia","symptom onset","clinical features of coronavirus disease","women","years","D-dimer","chronic medical illnesses","Abstract Objective","Demographics","dismal prognosis","Methods","Data","high mortality","vs"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have suggested a role for both N and hnRNP-A1 proteins in MHV RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether the two proteins can interact with each other. Here we employed a series of methods to determine their interactions both in vitro and in vivo. Both N and hnRNP-A1 genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and their interactions were determined with a GST-binding assay. Results showed that N protein directly and specifically interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vitro. To dissect the protein-binding domain on the N protein, 15 deletion constructs were made by PCR and expressed as GST fusion proteins. Two hnRNP-A1-binding sites were identified on N protein: site A is located at amino acids 1 to 292 and site B at amino acids 392 to 455. In addition, we found that N protein interacted with itself and that the self-interacting domain coincided with site A but not with site B. Using a fluorescence double-staining technique, we showed that N protein colocalized with hnRNP-A1 in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region, of MHV-infected cells, where viral RNA replication/transcription occurs. The N protein and hnRNP-A1 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of MHV-infected cells either by an N- or by an hnRNP-A1-specific monoclonal antibody, indicating a physical interaction between N and hnRNP-A1 proteins. Furthermore, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that N protein interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vivo. These results thus establish that MHV N protein interacts with hnRNP-A1 both in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"1999-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yicheng; Zhang, Xuming","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cb8b75e74684f31504a66d1cd7e7c37ad91a64c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682299900259; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682299900259","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","MHV","PCR","GST","MHV N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV N protein","hnRNP-A1 proteins","hnRNP-A1 genes","protein-binding domain","RNA-binding proteins","MHV RNA synthesis","GST fusion proteins","lysates of MHV","MHV-infected cells","protein of mouse hepatitis virus","cellular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1","binding sites","GST-binding assay","leader RNA","site B","viral RNA replication","amino acids","interactions","Results","intergenic sequence of MHV negative-strand template RNAs","self-interacting domain","glutathione S-transferase","physical interaction","specific monoclonal antibody","PCR","Escherichia coli","perinuclear region","fluorescence double-staining technique","role","deletion constructs","cytoplasm","hybrid system","transcription","nucleocapsid","Previous studies","yeast","series of methods","addition"],"language":"en"},

This overview is focused on the substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and subcellular location of the mammalian dNKs and rNKs and their role in the activation of NAs.","publish_time":"2003-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Rompay, An R; Johansson, Magnus; Karlsson, Anna","journal":"Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a00a13cd289143e5a187a230b800373d45d67264.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126524.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725803001190; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725803001190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anticancer NAs","activation of NAs","Antiviral NAs","rNKs","intracellular phosphorylation","nucleoside analogues","viral genome","phosphorylation step","viral infections","deoxyribonucleoside kinases","mammalian dNKs","cellular DNA replication","corresponding monophosphate form","active triphosphate form","Abstract Structural analogues of nucleosides","subcellular location","tissue distribution","deoxyribonucleosides","role","substrate specificity","inactive prodrugs","repair","treatment of cancer","overview"],"language":"en"},

However, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunological approach are relatively low because there are no specific markers for antigen-specific Th cells, and some of the Th cells that do not produce cytokines can be overlooked using this approach. In this study, we found that MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10 can stimulate the expression of CD40L specifically in CD4(\u002B) T cells but not other cells from pleural fluid cells (PFCs) in patients with tuberculous pleurisy (TBP). CD4(\u002B)CD40L(\u002B) but not CD4(\u002B)CD40L(\u2212) T cells express IFN-\u03B3, IL-2, TNF-\u03B1, IL-17 or IL-22 after stimulation with MTB-specific peptides.

The aim of this study was to systematically review main clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric age. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed database. Papers published between 1 January and 1 May 2020 including children aged 0-18 years were selected. Sixty-two studies and three reviews were included, with a total sample size of 7480 children (2428/4660 males, 52.1%; weighted mean age 7.6 years). Patients showed mainly mild (608/1432, 42.5%) and moderate (567/1432, 39.6%) signs of the infection. About 2% of children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The most commonly described symptoms were fever (51.6%) and cough (47.3%). Laboratory findings were often unremarkable. Children underwent a chest CT scan in 73.9% of all cases, and 32.7% resulted normal. Overall, the estimated mortality was 0.08%. A higher proportion of newborns was severely ill (12%) and dyspnea was the most common reported sign (40%).Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 affects children less severely than adults.

In the context of a pseudoknot-stalled complex, the translocase EF-2 is seen to compress a hybrid-state tRNA into a strained conformation. We propose that this strain energy helps overcome the kinetic barrier to translocation and drives tRNA into the P-site, with EF-2 biasing this relaxation in one direction.

We previously demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 318\u2013510) of S protein contains multiple conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes (Conf I to VI) and serves as a major target of SARS-CoV neutralization. Here, we further characterized the antigenic structure in the RBD by a panel of novel mAbs isolated from the mice immunized with an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine. Ten of the RBD-specific mAbs were mapped to four distinct groups of conformational epitopes (designated Group A to D), and all of which had potent neutralizing activity against S protein-pseudotyped SARS viruses. Group A, B, C mAbs target the epitopes that may overlap with the previously characterized Conf I, III, and VI respectively, but they display different capacity to block the receptor binding. Group D mAb (S25) was directed against a unique epitope by its competitive binding. Two anti-RBD mAbs recognizing the linear epitopes (Group E) were mapped to the RBD residues 335\u2013352 and 442\u2013458, respectively, and none of them inhibited the receptor binding and virus entry. Surprisingly, most neutralizing epitopes (Groups A to C) could be completely disrupted by single amino acid substitutions (e.g., D429A, R441A or D454A) or by deletions of several amino acids at the N-terminal or C-terminal region of the RBD; however, the Group D epitope was not sensitive to the mutations, highlighting its importance for vaccine development. These data provide important information for understanding the antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV, and this panel of novel mAbs can be used as tools for studying the structure of S protein and for guiding SARS vaccine design.","publish_time":"2006-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Yuxian; Li, Jingjing; Du, Lanying; Yan, Xuxia; Hu, Guangan; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56728f5d794505494fd34baefcf69fe72c9811f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115380.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06004464; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06004464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":["Group D mAb","Group D","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-RBD mAbs","RBD-specific mAbs","RBD residues","inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine","immunogenicity of SARS","receptor binding","structure of S protein","major target of SARS","Group D epitope","guiding SARS vaccine design","S protein-pseudotyped SARS viruses","linear epitopes","designated Group","panel of novel mAbs","Group E","Group D mAb","receptor-binding domain","CoV neutralization","competitive binding","vaccine development","distinct groups of conformational epitopes","multiple conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes","C-terminal region","characterized Conf","potent neutralizing activity","protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","N-terminal","amino acids","unique epitope","major antigen","antigenic structure","single amino acid substitutions","D429A","antigenicity","R441A","deletions","mutations","S25","mice","tools","important information","D454A","importance","different capacity","virus entry","spike","data"],"language":"en"},

Male Holstein calves (n=93) \u003C1 wk old were stratified by arrival body weight (BW) and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2\u00D72 factorial arrangement of one-time administration of fluid support [either control electrolyte solution (E) or the serum protein-containing arrival formula (AF)] and 14d of either no supplementation (NG) or supplementation with Gammulin (G; APC Inc., Ankeny, IA), which contains serum proteins and FOS in addition to other solids, minerals, and vitamins. Upon arrival at the research facility, calves were orally administered either AF or E.

Nasal swabs were collected from participants and tested for 11 respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results. Of 165 participants sampled before departing to the KSA, 8 (4.8%) were positive for at least 1 virus (5 rhinovirus, 1 influenza C, 1 adenovirus, and 1 enterovirus). Seventy symptomatic pilgrims underwent additional nasal swabs during their pilgrimage in the KSA, of which 27 (38.6%) were positive for at least 1 virus (19 rhinovirus, 6 influenza A, 1 influenza C, 1 respiratory syncytial virus B, 1 metapneumovirus, 1 adenovirus, and 1 enterovirus).

The Asia-Pacific region contains low and middle income countries in which the risk of EID outbreaks is elevated and whose health care systems may require international support to effectively detect and respond to such events. The absence of comprehensive data on populations, health care systems and disease characteristics in this region makes risk assessment and decisions about the provision of such support challenging. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe a mathematical modelling framework that can inform this process by integrating available data sources, systematically explore the effects of uncertainty, and provide estimates of outbreak risk under a range of intervention scenarios. We illustrate the use of this framework in the context of a potential importation of Ebola Virus Disease into the Asia-Pacific region. Results suggest that, across a wide range of plausible scenarios, preemptive interventions supporting the timely detection of early cases provide substantially greater reductions in the probability of large outbreaks than interventions that support health care system capacity after an outbreak has commenced. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates how, in the presence of substantial uncertainty about health care system infrastructure and other relevant aspects of disease control, mathematical models can be used to assess the constraints that limited resources place upon the ability of local health care systems to detect and respond to EID outbreaks in a timely and effective fashion. Our framework can help evaluate the relative impact of these constraints to identify resourcing priorities for health care system support, in order to inform principled and quantifiable decision making.","publish_time":"2016-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moss, Robert; Hickson, Roslyn I.; McVernon, Jodie; McCaw, James M.; Hort, Krishna; Black, Jim; Madden, John R.; Tran, Nhi H.; McBryde, Emma S.; Geard, Nicholas","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0dbc87d51c4d8a07ff83c5fc53afac5f973a20a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d75d565a2c7f9bc13b6dbb4fa45eb85e2a1c72cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5035030.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27661978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care system support","health care system infrastructure","health care system capacity","ability of local health care systems","risk of EID outbreaks","international support","disease characteristics","infectious disease","localised outbreaks","support challenging","Asia-Pacific region","risk assessment","estimates of outbreak risk","probability of large outbreaks","mathematical modelling framework","constraints","relevant aspects of disease control","range of intervention scenarios","potential importation of Ebola Virus Disease","preemptive interventions","wide range of plausible scenarios","mathematical models","effects of uncertainty","Effective response","effective fashion","international scale","presence of substantial uncertainty","absence of comprehensive data","available data sources","timely detection of early cases","order","populations","resourcing priorities","greater reductions","middle income countries","threats","context","process","provision","decisions","quantifiable decision making","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","relative impact","study","resources","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODOLOGY","use","Results","events"],"language":"en"},

For quantification of the viral content of the vaccine, dilution series of the final product are inoculated in embryonated chicken eggs. After the incubation period of seven days standard practice is for the embryos to be taken from each egg and examined visually for IB specific lesions; these readings are used to determine an end-point in viral titrations. The result is a titre value to which both strains contribute. However, it is not clear what the live virus titre is for strain IB H120 and for strain IB D274. In order to determine end-points in the titration for each of the two strains, we collected the allantoic fluids from each egg after the incubation period and tested these for the presence of IB H120 and IB D274 by a strain specific reverse phase PCR. Based on the data obtained by PCR we were able to determine an end-point for each of the two strains. For a given commercial batch of Poulvac IB primer we determined titres of 106.31 EID50 per vial for IB H120 and 106.59 EID50 for IB D274 using PCR for end-point determination. These end-points matched well with the end-point determined for both strains cumulatively after visual examination, i.e. 106.67 EID50 per vial. It is concluded that PCR is a suitable means to determine end-points in titrations of live viruses.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geerligs, H.

This work uses Randic\u0027s star networks in order to convert the protein primary structure data in specific topological indices that are used to construct a natural/random protein classification model. The set of natural proteins contains 1046 protein chains selected from the pre-compiled CulledPDB list from PISCES Dunbrack\u0027s Web Lab. This set is characterized by a protein homology of 20%, a structure resolution of 1.6\u00C5 and R-factor lower than 25%. The set of random amino acid chains contains 1046 sequences which were generated by Python script according to the same type of residues and average chain length found in the natural set. A new Sequence to Star Networks (S2SNet) wxPython GUI application (with a Graphviz graphics back-end) was designed by our group in order to transform any character sequence in the following star network topological indices: Shannon entropy of Markov matrices, trace of connectivity matrices, Harary number, Wiener index, Gutman index, Schultz index, Moreau\u2013Broto indices, Balaban distance connectivity index, Kier\u2013Hall connectivity indices and Randic connectivity index. The model was constructed with the General Discriminant Analysis methods from STATISTICA package and gave training/predicting set accuracies of 90.77% for the forward stepwise model type. In conclusion, this study extends for the first time the classical TIs to protein star network TIs by proposing a model that can predict if a protein/fragment of protein is natural or random using only the amino acid sequence data. This classification can be used in the studies of the protein functions by changing some fragments with random amino acid sequences or to detect the fake amino acid sequences or the errors in proteins. These results promote the use of the S2SNet application not only for protein structure analysis but also for mass spectroscopy, clinical proteomics and imaging, or DNA/RNA structure analysis.","publish_time":"2008-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munteanu, Cristian Robert; Gonz\u00E1lez-D\u00EDaz, Humberto; Borges, Fernanda; de Magalh\u00E3es, Alexandre Lopes","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c543901ef5d8b67ab0738043c6e074da5c69ba90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094162.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251930800369X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.07.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692072/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002251930800369X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shannon"],"organizations":["Star Networks","GUI","Balaban","General Discriminant Analysis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein chains","protein structure analysis","protein functions","fragment of protein","protein homology","protein star network TIs","random protein classification model","natural set","protein primary structure data","set of random amino acid chains","random amino acid sequences","set of natural proteins","Randic connectivity index","Hall connectivity indices","amino acid sequence data","following star network topological indices","Gutman index","Wiener index","Schultz index","Broto indices","specific topological indices","fake amino acid sequences","set accuracies","Balaban distance connectivity index","Randic\u0027s star networks","RNA structure analysis","structure resolution","trace of connectivity matrices","genetic networks","S2SNet application","classical TIs","order","character sequence","new Sequence","forward stepwise model type","complex network graphs","real properties","General Discriminant Analysis methods","real system","type of residues","wxPython GUI application","Shannon entropy of Markov matrices","Moreau","Harary number","imaging","pre-compiled CulledPDB list","PISCES Dunbrack\u0027s Web","STATISTICA package","mass spectroscopy","DNA","fragments","average chain length","clinical proteomics","training","computer","time","errors","Graphviz graphics","R-factor lower","end","group","development","use","Python script","studies","study","results","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Numerous pre-clinical studies are evaluating RNAi as a novel therapeutic modality in the battle against gain-of-function autosomal dominant diseases, cancer, and viral infections. One emerging concern is that RNAi mono-therapies might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape silencing by mutation and/or RNAi suppression. Thus, sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim to avert viral resistance by combining RNAi effectors with each other or with further gene expression inhibitors. Several reports already validate this new concept of \u201Ccombinatorial RNAi\u201D (coRNAi) and illustrate its versatility by describing co-expression of RNAi triggers directed against single or multiple, viral or cellular, targets. Other studies document the successful delivery of these triggers with additional RNA- or protein-based silencers. Moreover, vectors have been engineered to blend RNAi-mediated gene inhibition with conventional gene replacement strategies. Collectively, these efforts open up exciting new therapeutic avenues but could also augment the inherent risks of RNAi technology, including immune responses, off-targeting, and oversaturation of endogenous pathways. Here, we critically review all coRNAi strategies and discuss the requirements for their transition into clinical application.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grimm, Dirk; Kay, Mark A","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1ebf10b568022cf6500990bcfadf9054864211b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106227.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616316392; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616316392","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combinatorial RNAi","RNAi effectors","RNAi suppression","RNAi-mediated gene inhibition","co-expression of RNAi triggers","RNAi mono-therapies","inherent risks of RNAi technology","gene expression sequence","gene expression inhibitors","coRNAi strategies","conventional gene replacement strategies","additional RNA","RNA interference","viral infections","viral resistance","sophisticated strategies","double-stranded RNA","exciting new therapeutic avenues","new concept","Numerous pre-clinical studies","clinical application","novel therapeutic modality","gain","cancer","function autosomal dominant diseases","battle","requirements","successful delivery","protein-based silencers","efforts","mutation","versatility","emerging concern","immune responses","viruses","transition","targets","ability","revolutionizing science","silencing","oversaturation of endogenous pathways","medicine","reports","vectors"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: In 85 BAL samples from 82 patients, median viral load in copies/ml for RSV (n=35) was 2.6\u00D710(6), PIV (n=35) 4.9\u00D710(7), influenza (n=9) 6.8\u00D710(5), MPV (n=7) 3.9\u00D710(7), and CoV (n=4) 1.8\u00D710(5). Quantitative viral load was not associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Viral RNA was detected in serum of 6 of 66 patients: 4 of 41 with RSV pneumonia, 1 with influenza B, and 1 with MPV/influenza A/CoV co-infection (influenza A and MPV RNA detected). RSV detection in serum was associated with high viral load in BAL (p=0.05). Detection of viral RNA in serum was significantly associated with death (adjusted RR 1.8, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR detects high viral load in BAL samples from HCT recipients with respiratory virus pneumonia. Viral RNA is also detectable in serum of patients with RSV, influenza, and MPV pneumonia, and may correlate with disease severity.","publish_time":"2010-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campbell, Angela P.; Chien, Jason W.; Kuypers, Jane; Englund, Janet A.; Wald, Anna; Guthrie, Katherine A.; Corey, Lawrence; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b421ef0a9d90b40501908049c59ceeede0876c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2853730.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/201/9/1404/18061777/201-9-1404.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1086/651662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20350162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL","RNA","MPV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum samples","BAL samples","Quantitative viral load","Detection of viral RNA","serum of patients","RSV pneumonia","MPV pneumonia","respiratory virus pneumonia","MPV RNA","high viral load","respiratory virus-associated pneumonia","median viral load","RSV detection","lower respiratory samples","influenza B","respiratory virus quantitation","respiratory syncytial virus","HCT recipients","stored BAL","quantitative PCR","death","PIV","CoV co-infection","hematopoietic cell transplantation","copies","parainfluenza","data","metapneumovirus","coronavirus","CONCLUSION","mechanical ventilation","adjusted RR","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","disease severity"],"language":"en"},

Here, we identified 137 protein sites that experienced deceleration in their rate of evolution along the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny, likely indicating gain-of-function and consequent adaptation. The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees. We suggest that the species barrier is higher when the genetic distance of the hosts increases. Our approach paves the way for subsequent studies on cross-species transfers in other major pathogens.","publish_time":"2017-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gelbart, Maoz; Stern, Adi","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2df9bde0968bdb39b70c83cb8aec59287961ff76.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/190769","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cross-species transmission events","species barrier","cross-species transfers","rate deceleration events","viral adaptation","consequent adaptation","cross-species virus transmission event","pandemic group","non-pandemic HIV","major barrier","rate of evolution","independent adaptation strategies","process of molecular adaptation","evolutionary rate decelerations","host antiviral restriction factors","group O","new host","major pathogens","subsequent studies","accessory proteins","gorillas","genetic distance","gain","way","groups","approach","SIV phylogeny","function","protein sites","hosts","majority","chimpanzees"],"language":"en"},

However, the impact of platelets on HIV-1 infection of T cells is unclear. RESULTS: We found that platelets suppress HIV-1 spread in co-cultured T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Platelets containing granules inhibited HIV-1 spread in T cells more efficiently than degranulated platelets, indicating that the granule content might exert antiviral activity. Indeed, supernatants from activated and thus degranulated platelets suppressed HIV-1 infection. Infection was inhibited at the stage of host cell entry and inhibition was independent of the viral strain or coreceptor tropism. In contrast, blockade of HIV-2 and SIV entry was less efficient. The chemokine CXCL4, a major component of platelet granules, blocked HIV-1 entry and neutralization of CXCL4 in platelet supernatants largely abrogated their anti-HIV-1 activity. CONCLUSIONS: Release of CXCL4 by activated platelets inhibits HIV-1 infection of adjacent T cells at the stage of virus entry. The inhibitory activity of platelet-derived CXCL4 suggests a role of platelets in the defense against infection by HIV-1 and potentially other pathogens.","publish_time":"2013-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Solomon Tsegaye, Theodros; Gnir\u00DF, Kerstin; Rahe-Meyer, Niels; Kiene, Miriam; Kr\u00E4mer-K\u00FChl, Annika; Behrens, Georg; M\u00FCnch, Jan; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e64c852725ef6bf2abf9071b522c10917b50ac6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3660175.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23634812/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-10-48","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blocked HIV","anti-HIV","blockade of HIV","degranulated platelets","role of platelets","impact of platelets","infection of T cells","infection of adjacent T cells","platelet supernatants","inhibitory activity of platelet","co-cultured T cells","derived CXCL4","platelet counts","neutralization of CXCL4","SIV entry","chemokine CXCL4","Release of CXCL4","stage of virus entry","stage of host cell entry","major component of platelet granules","antiviral activity","viral strain","viral load","anucleate cell fragments abundant","inhibition","human blood","granule content","concentration-dependent manner","BACKGROUND","defense","coreceptor tropism","disease progression","CONCLUSIONS","contrast","RESULTS","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Facemasks are a promising preventive measure, however, previous studies on the efficacy of facemasks have been inconclusive. This study proposes a large-scale facemask trial during the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia and presents this protocol to illustrate its feasibility and to promote both collaboration with other research groups and additional relevant studies. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster-randomised controlled trial is being conducted to test the efficacy of standard facemasks in preventing symptomatic and proven viral RTIs among pilgrims during the Hajj season in Mina, Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The trial will compare the \u2018supervised use of facemasks\u2019 versus \u2018standard measures\u2019 among pilgrims over several Hajj seasons. Cluster-randomisation will be done by accommodation tents with a 1:1 ratio. For the intervention tents, free facemasks will be provided to be worn consistently for 7 days. Data on flu-like symptoms and mask use will be recorded in diaries. Nasal samples will be collected from symptomatic recruits and tested for nucleic acid of respiratory viruses. Data obtained from questionnaires, diaries and laboratory tests will be analysed to examine whether mask use significantly reduces the frequency of laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection and syndromic RTI as primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will provide valuable evidence on the efficacy of standard facemask use in preventing viral respiratory tract infections at mass gatherings.

METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to patients, visitors, non-clinical staff and volunteers. Data were collected on knowledge, preventative measures, information sources, attitudes to government and media reporting, perceived seriousness, behaviour change and intended compliance with future measures. Results were used to construct an overall knowledge score. RESULTS: There were 252 participants. Traditional forms of mass media (138 [55%]) remained the principal information source. Approximately 70% (176) accurately described mode of transmission and recommended precautions and 68% (175) reported behaviour change because of the pandemic. Gaps in knowledge included failure to identify certain high risk groups. Recall of government campaigns was significantly associated with a higher knowledge score. 60% (151) thought that authorities and media had exaggerated the threat; only 40% (101) would comply with recommended measures in a future pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge regarding pandemic influenza was high in this population and positively affected by official campaigns.

In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies. Although a great amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirus-associated disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID-19) is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population.

Proteins exposed to the extracellular environment, both cell surface-expressed receptors and secreted proteins, are essential targets for initial invasion and play key roles in pathogen recognition and subsequent immunoregulatory processes. The identification of the host and pathogen extracellular molecules and their interaction networks is fundamental to understanding tissue tropism and pathogenesis and to inform the development of therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless, the characterization of the proteins that function in the host-pathogen interface has been challenging, largely due to the technical challenges associated with detection of extracellular protein interactions. This review discusses available technologies for the high throughput study of extracellular protein interactions between pathogens and their hosts, with a focus on mammalian viruses and bacteria. Emerging work illustrates a rich landscape for extracellular host-pathogen interaction and points towards the evolution of multifunctional pathogen-encoded proteins. Further development and application of technologies for genome-wide identification of extracellular protein interactions will be important in deciphering functional host-pathogen interaction networks, laying the foundation for development of novel therapeutics.","publish_time":"2017-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez-Martin, Nadia","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47826d4f9693f8859eff729ef432cc24d41cd896.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5340944.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2197615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28321417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extracellular host-pathogen interaction","pathogen extracellular molecules","host-pathogen interface","pathogen recognition","extracellular environment","detection of extracellular protein interactions","deciphering functional host-pathogen interaction networks","genome-wide identification of extracellular protein interactions","evolution of multifunctional pathogen-encoded proteins","high throughput study of extracellular protein interactions","secreted proteins","host immune response","Pathogens","cell surface barrier","development of novel therapeutics","development of therapeutic strategies","available technologies","application of technologies","key roles","points","rich landscape","essential targets","initial invasion","foundation","subsequent immunoregulatory processes","receptors","hosts","tissue tropism","unique mechanisms","focus","pathogenesis","mammalian viruses","productive infection","Emerging work","technical challenges","bacteria","review","characterization"],"language":"en"},

Virus specific epitopes could benefit for developing JEV specific antibodies detection methods. To identify the JEV specific epitopes, we fully mapped and characterized the continuous B-cell epitope of the PrM/M protein of JEV. RESULTS: To map the epitopes on the PrM/M protein, we designed a set of 20 partially overlapping fragments spanning the whole PrM, fused them with GST, and expressed them in an expression vector. Linear epitope M14 ((105)VNKKEAWLDSTKATRY(120)) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By removing amino acid residues individually from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptide M14, we confirmed that the minimal unit of the linear epitope of PrM/M was M14-13 ((108)KEAWLDSTKAT(118)). This epitope was highly conserved across different JEV strains. Moreover, this epitope did not cross-react with WNV-positive and DENV-positive sera. CONCLUSION: Epitope M14-13 was a JEV specific lineal B-cell epitpe. The results may provide a useful basis for the development of epitope-based virus specific diagnostic clinical techniques.","publish_time":"2010-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Rong-Hong; Chen, Na-Sha; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Ge, Jin-Ying; Wang, Xi-Jun; Qiao, Zu-Jian; Chen, Wei-Ye; Wen, Zhi-Yuan; Liu, Wen-Xin; Hu, Sen; Bu, Zhi-Gao","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13194f8e42df83d260e53ad9bf7448577e9319e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2954857.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858291/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV","PrM/M","Linear"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JEV specific epitopes","Virus specific epitopes","linear epitope of PrM","Linear epitope M14","development of epitope","protein of JEV","Dengue virus","continuous B-cell epitope","JEV specific lineal B-cell epitpe","JEV specific antibodies detection methods","different JEV strains","Japanese encephalitis virus","based virus specific diagnostic clinical techniques","West Nile virus","infection","WNV-positive","amino terminal of peptide M14","RESULTS","DENV-positive sera","amino acid residues","flavivirus","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","ELISA","Differential","useful basis","DV","minimal unit","BACKGROUND","set","overlapping fragments","VNKKEAWLDSTKATRY","CONCLUSION","expression vector","GST"],"language":"en"},

While infectious bronchitis (IB) is considered primarily a disease of the respiratory system, different IBV strains may show variable tissue tropisms and also affect the oviduct and the kidneys, with serious consequences. Some strains replicate in the intestine but apparently without pathological changes. Pectoral myopathy has been associated with an important recent variant. Several factors can influence the course of infection with IBV, including the age, breed and nutrition of the chicken, the environment and intercurrent infection with other infectious agents. Immunogenic components of the virus include the S (spike) proteins and the N nucleoprotein. The humoral, local and cellular responses of the chicken to IBV are reviewed, together with genetic resistance of the chicken. In long-term persistence of IBV, the caecal tonsil or kidney have been proposed as the sites of persistence. Antigenic variation among IBV strains is related to relatively small differences in amino acid sequences in the S1 spike protein. However, antigenic studies alone do not adequately define immunological relationships between strains and cross-immunisation studies have been used to classify IBV isolates into \u2018protectotypes\u2019. It has been speculated that changes in the S1 protein may be related to differences in tissue tropisms shown by different strains. Perhaps in the future, new strains of IBV may arise which affect organs or systems not normally associated with IB.","publish_time":"2007-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raj, G. Dhinakar; Jones, R.

We also showed the raft-location of CD163, which might contribute to the glycoproteins\u2013raft association. Subsequently, raft disruption caused a significant reduction of viral RNA production. Moreover, Nsp9 was shown to be distributed in rafts, suggesting that rafts probably serve as a platform for PRRSV replication. Finally, we confirmed that disassembly of rafts on the virus envelope may affect the integrity of PRRSV particles and cause the leakage of viral proteins, which impaired PRRSV infectivity.

Methods: A survey conducted at hospital staff meetings between May and August 2006. Results: Out of 570 questionnaires distributed, 560 were completed. For scenario one, 72 (13%) indicated that they would not attend work, and an additional 136 (25%) would only work provided that immunizations and/or antiviral medications were immediately available, so that up to 208 (38%) would not attend work. For scenario two, 196 (36%) would not attend work, and an additional 95 (17%) would work only if immunizations and/or antiviral medications were immediately available, so that up to 291 (53%) staff would not attend work. Staff whose work required them to be in the ED (odds ratios 2.2 and 1.6 for each scenario respectively) or on acute medical wards (odds ratios 2.2 and 2.0 respectively) were more likely to work. Conclusion: High absenteeism among hospital staff should be anticipated if patients are admitted with either avian or pandemic influenza, particularly if specific antiviral preventative measures are not immediately available. Measures to maximize the safety of staff and their families would be important incentives to attend work.

Surveillance of novel viruses in animals is essential to evaluate the risk to human and animal health and to determine any economic impact, for example, failure to thrive. There is a paucity of data regarding detection and characterisation of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in porcines in Ireland. Recently, a number of small novel porcine DNA viruses have emerged globally, for example, torque teno sus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 \u0026 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses which has been recently detected in humans and animals. METHODS: In this study, the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus, and porcine bocavirus) was investigated in a selection of archived faecal samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 specimens were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), a subset of specimens (n=44) were then examined individually. Viral diversity was then investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. RESULTS: Initial screening showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm, with the formation of three distinct groups in phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also investigated in this study with the first report of PCV, PAdV and lineage I G5 RVA in Ireland. Some specimens contained \u003E1 virus, with statistical analysis indicating a strong correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV on this farm. CONCLUSION: Investigating the diversity of circulating enteric viruses on Irish porcine farms is important to improve the prophylactic tools available and to facilitate the early detection of changes in circulating viruses.","publish_time":"2015-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunn, Lynda; Collins, Patrick James; Fanning, S\u00E9amus; McKillen, John; Morgan, John; Staines, Anthony; O\u0027Shea, Helen","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07241235ee553a5b165ed19b2091101128eca805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4462827.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26065833/; https://doi.org/10.3402/iee.v5.27270","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ireland"],"keyphrases":["circulating viruses","enteric viruses","Surveillance of novel viruses","characterisation of gastroenteritis viruses","presence of gastroenteritis viruses","distinct group of viruses","porcine bocavirus","number of small novel porcine DNA viruses","porcine circovirus","example","Ireland","Irish porcine farms","PAdV","statistical analysis","commercial farm","Livestock animals","phylogenetic analysis","study","phylogenetic techniques","subset of specimens","rotavirus G8","RT-PCR","human epidemics","distinct groups","Viral diversity","high prevalence of PBoV","mixed infections of PBoV","early detection of changes","conventional molecular techniques","torque teno sus virus","asymptomatic piglets","influenza H1N1","G9","lineage","recent years","strong correlation","assumed source","selection of archived faecal samples","risk","adenovirus","Initial screening","animal health","economic impact","report of PCV","G5 RVA","prophylactic tools available","formation","paucity of data","RESULTS","MERS-CoV","failure","biology","potential pathogenicity","parvoviruses","porcines","Bocaparvovirus","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS","total","humans"],"language":"en"},

Methods We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020\u201310.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Results We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%\u201311.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients. Conclusions The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lodigiani, Corrado; Iapichino, Giacomo; Carenzo, Luca; Cecconi, Maurizio; Ferrazzi, Paola; Sebastian, Tim; Kucher, Nils; Studt, Jan-Dirk; Sacco, Clara; Alexia, Bertuzzi; Sandri, Maria Teresa; Barco, Stefano","journal":"Thromb Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08767d008d8720813b015083d5c3db8e7309ffc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177070.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384820301407; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049384820301407?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353746/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","VTE","CTPA","ACS/MI"],"locations":["Milan"],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","hospitalized patients","consecutive symptomatic patients","venous thromboembolic events","high rate of positive VTE imaging tests","rate of ischemic stroke","ambulatory COVID","cumulative rate","characteristics of thromboembolic complications","specific VTE diagnostic strategies","ACS","laboratory-proven COVID","h of admission","h of hospital admission","Overt DIC","CTPA","general ward","venous thromboembolism","Secondary outcome","primary outcome","safety of thromboprophylaxis","university hospital","pulmonary embolism","high number of arterial","overt disseminated intravascular coagulation","Computed tomography pulmonary angiography","acute coronary syndrome","efficacy","myocardial infarction","urgent need","men","data","years","median age","Abstract Background","Milan","Italy","Conclusions","intensive care","Methods","closed cases","total","Half"],"language":"en"},

To that effect, we developed a 96-well microplate assay for the measurement of HCMV-neutralizing activity in human sera using the HCMV-permissive human cell line HEL-299 and the laboratory strain of HCMV AD169. The degree to which neutralizing antibodies diminish HCMV infection of cells in the assay is determined by quantifying the nuclei of infected cells based on expression of the 72 kDa IE1 viral protein. Nuclear IE1 is visualized using a highly sensitive immunoperoxidase staining and the stained nuclei are counted using an automated ELISPOT analyzer. The use of Half Area 96-well microplates, with wells in which the surface area of the well bottom is half the area of a standard 96-well microplate plate, improves signal detection compared with standard microplates and economizes on the usage of indicator cells, virus, and reagents. The staining process was also streamlined by using a microplate washer and data analysis was simplified and accelerated by employing a software program that automatically plots neutralization curves and determines NT(50) values using 4-PL curve fitting. The optimized assay is not only fast and convenient, but also specific, sensitive, precise and reproducible and thus has the characteristics necessary for use in measuring HCMV neutralizing activity in the sera of vaccine trial subjects such as the recipients of Vical\u2019s HCMV pDNA vaccine candidates.","publish_time":"2007-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abai, Anna Maria; Smith, Larry R.; Wloch, Mary K.","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c2acffdc35700ec79736d34954367e953c68556.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7fa1b6e588709fb66cef61b3636e5e93db07f9b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1933494.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175907000476; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1933494?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175907000476","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","Vical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["measuring HCMV","measurement of HCMV","microplate assay","HCMV infection of cells","use","optimized assay","laboratory strain of HCMV AD169","assessment of neutralizing antibody activity","HCMV-permissive human cell line HEL","human sera","recipients of Vical\u2019s HCMV pDNA vaccine candidates","nuclei of infected cells","microplate plate","sensitive immunoperoxidase staining","microplate washer","standard microplates","surface area","sera of vaccine trial subjects","usage of indicator cells","stained nuclei","Nuclear IE1","staining process","clinical trial samples","kDa IE1 viral protein","automation","expression","signal detection","characteristics necessary","values","neutralization curves","virus","antibodies","high-volume screening","PL curve fitting","software program","automated ELISPOT analyzer","data analysis","reagents","wells","degree","addition","effect"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Retrospective epidemiological analysis. SETTING: Multiple healthcare facilities of secondary and tertiary care centres in an urban setting. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 185 laboratory-confirmed cases with partially known dates of illness onset and most likely sources of infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Superspreaders were identified using the transmission tree. The reproduction number, that is, the average number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case, was estimated as a function of time and according to different types of hosts. RESULTS: A total of five superspreaders were identified. The reproduction number throughout the course of the outbreak was estimated at 1.0 due to reconstruction of the transmission tree, while the variance of secondary cases generated by a primary case was 52.1. All of the superspreaders involved in this outbreak appeared to have generated a substantial number of contacts in multiple healthcare facilities (association: p\u003C0.01), generating on average 4.0 (0.0\u20138.6) and 28.6 (0.0\u201363.9) secondary cases among patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities and others. The time-dependent reproduction numbers declined substantially below the value of 1 on and after 13 June 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Superspreaders who visited multiple facilities drove the epidemic by generating a disproportionate number of secondary cases. Our findings underscore the need to limit the contacts in healthcare settings. Contact tracing efforts could assist early laboratory testing and diagnosis of suspected cases.","publish_time":"2016-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi; Endo, Akira; Saitoh, Masaya; Kinoshita, Ryo; Ueno, Ryo; Nakaoka, Shinji; Miyamatsu, Yuichiro; Dong, Yueping; Chowell, Gerardo; Mizumoto, Kenji","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75275e1adbc2a3dcb78893dd1cf92d7fcf2915cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4769415.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26908522/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009936","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Republic"],"keyphrases":["average number of secondary cases","Multiple healthcare facilities of secondary","disproportionate number of secondary cases","variance of secondary cases","multiple facilities","diagnosis of suspected cases","SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES","substantial number of contacts","epidemiological characteristics of superspreaders","healthcare settings","transmission tree","single primary case","total","outbreak","time-dependent reproduction numbers","urban setting","function of time","early laboratory testing","Retrospective epidemiological analysis","heterogeneous transmission patterns of Middle East respiratory syndrome","tertiary care centres","MERS","known dates of illness onset","particular focus","association","Contact tracing efforts","patients","likely sources of infection","Republic of Korea","epidemic","different types of hosts","DESIGN","need","course","CONCLUSIONS","value","OBJECTIVES","PARTICIPANTS","reconstruction","RESULTS","findings"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this retrospective observational study investigated the impact of SARS outbreak on ED visits and the cost of these visits in a designated SARS medical center. Methods Data related to the total number of ED visits and their costs were collected for the SARS epidemic period in 2003 and the same period in the preceding year in 2002. Data collected included total number of ED visits, services provided, triage categories, and total expenditures for all patients. Data for before and during the outbreak were retrieved and compared. Results At the peak of the SARS epidemic, the reduction in daily ED visits reached 51.6% of pre-epidemic numbers (p \u003C 0.01). In pediatric, trauma and non-trauma patients, the maximum mean decreases in number of visits were 80.0% (p \u003C 0.01), 57.6% (p \u003C 0.01) and 40.8% (p \u003C 0.01), respectively. In triage 1, 2 and 3 patients, the maximum mean decreases were 18.1% (p \u003C 0.01), 55.9% (p \u003C 0.01) and 53.7% (p \u003C 0.01), respectively. The maximum decrease in total costs was 37.7% (p \u003C 0.01). The maximum mean costs per patient increased 35.9% (p \u003C 0.01). The proportions of increases in mean costs for each patient were attributed to laboratory investigations (31.4%), radiography (21.9%) and medications (29.5%). Conclusion The SARS outbreak resulted in a marked reduction in the number of ED visits which persisted for 3 months after the end of the epidemic. Total cost of treating individual patients showed a simultaneous marked increase, while overall operational costs in the ED showed a marked decrease. The increased total cost for each patient was attributed to the increased number of diagnostic procedures to screen for possible SARS in the ED.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Hsien-Hao; Yen, David Hung-Tsang; Kao, Wei-Fong; Wang, Lee-Min; Huang, Chun-I; Lee, Chen-Hsen","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73f7a5c202ee3e20d3c5015cff6427b1c3719fed.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664609601066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664609601066","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of visits","total number of ED visits","daily ED visits","total costs","impact of SARS outbreak","SARS epidemic period","maximum mean costs","possible SARS","total expenditures","increased total cost","maximum mean decreases","operational costs","maximum decrease","marked reduction","individual patients","designated SARS medical center","increased number of diagnostic procedures","marked decrease","non-trauma patients","pre-epidemic numbers","Methods Data","simultaneous marked increase","hospital expenditures","triage categories","long-term impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome","emergency department","services","retrospective observational study","months","proportions of increases","objectives","peak","laboratory investigations","radiography","preceding year","Results","Conclusion","medications"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrated that GLDC inhibitor AOAA and siRNA depletion boosted IFN\u03B2\u2010 and IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) in combination with PolyI:C stimulation. GLDC inhibition and depletion significantly amplified antiviral response of type I IFNs and ISGs upon viral infection and suppressed the replication of H1N1 and H7N9 viruses. Consistently, GLDC overexpression significantly promoted viral replication due to the attenuated antiviral responses. Moreover, GLDC inhibition in H1N1\u2010infected BALB/c mice recapitulated the amplified antiviral response and suppressed viral growth. AOAA provided potent protection to the infected mice from lethal infection, comparable to a standard antiviral against influenza viruses.

One effective strategy in reducing the toxic effects of As is the usage of chelating agents, which provide the formation of inert chelator\u2013metal complexes with their further excretion from the body. This review discusses different aspects of the use of metal chelators, alone or in combination, in the treatment of As poisoning. Consideration is given to the therapeutic effect of thiol chelators such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, penicillamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and other recent agents against As toxicity.

Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates.","publish_time":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ki Hyun; Kim, Jinhee; Ko, Meehyun; Chun, June Young; Kim, Hyori; Kim, Seungtaek; Min, Ji-Young; Park, Wan Beom; Oh, Myoung-don; Chung, Junho","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03797126b6e6689cc02878e641e5271d3b9a5d3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6380599.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707748/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFTSV"],"locations":["China","Japan"],"keyphrases":["Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV","non-linear epitope of Ab10","Gn glycoprotein domain","recombinant Gn glycoprotein","reported SFTSV isolates","SFTS virus","lethal dose of SFTSV","Korea","infection","therapeutic agent","protected host cells","severe hemorrhage","Severe fever","A129 mice","antibody library","cell membrane fusion","emerging infectious disease","alanine scanning","mass spectrometry","China","unstructured stem region","Gangwon","thrombocytopenia syndrome","conformational alteration","cross-linker","HB28","days","high fatality rate","Japan","inoculation","antibodies","treatment","phage","patient","potential","specific vaccine","SD4 strains","data","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P\u003C.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the initial epicenter in Wuhan City. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of social media data to predict COVID-19 disease severity, measure public reaction and behavior, and evaluate effectiveness of outbreak communication.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jiawei; Xu, Qing; Cuomo, Raphael; Purushothaman, Vidya; Mackey, Tim","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293582/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18700","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infoveillance","Weibo"],"locations":["Wuhan City","Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["Weibo COVID","number of Weibo posts","related posts","qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts","Wuhan City","number of cases","total daily cases of COVID","quantitative analysis","qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data","Weibo discussions","user-generated COVID","number of reported cases","Chinese microblogging platform Weibo","Qualitative content analysis","utility of social media data","public reaction","public knowledge","incidence proportion of cases","effectiveness of outbreak communication","disease distribution","disease severity","public uncertainty","coronavirus disease","study period","Chinese-language messages","Chinese National Health Commission","attitudes","early stages","Hubei Province","capital city","study time frame","RESULTS","topics","days","parent classifications of news","initial epicenter","initial insight","behaviors critical","rest of China","higher-risk behaviors","inductive manual coding approach","positive correlation","average","causative agent","control","epidemiological characteristics","origins","response measures","linear regression model","METHODS","Infoveillance approaches","BACKGROUND","pandemic","effect size","OBJECTIVE","aim","themes","CONCLUSIONS","Future studies"],"language":"en"},

A cohort mortality study was conducted to evaluate the survival outcome and determine if potential exposure to harmful agents leads to premature mortality among dentists. Methods Using the Life Table Analysis System, we calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for a cohort of 11,700 dentists affiliated with the Taiwan Dental Association. These dentists were followed from 1985\u20132009. Reference rates were derived from cause-, gender-, and age-specific mortality rates of the general population of Taiwan and 18,664 Taiwanese internists, who were considered to be more socioeconomically proximal to dentists. A Cox proportional hazard model was also constructed to determine multiple risk factors associated with mortality. Results Compared with the general population, dentists in Taiwan consistently demonstrated reduced from all-cause mortality. However, compared with internists, significant and excess mortality were observed in dentists for overall mortality (SMR=1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.00\u20131.26), drowning (SMR=6.62; 95% CI=2.15\u201315.45), and heart diseases (SMR=1.66; 95% CI=1.22\u20132.21). After adjusting for other risk factors, the Cox model showed an increased hazard ratio of 1.17 (95% CI=1.01\u20131.37) for dentists. Conclusion Taiwanese dentists demonstrated significant elevated SMRs for overall causes, drowning, and heart diseases. Careful precaution should be taken to reduce these trends. Future studies are also needed for in-depth exploration of the mechanisms regarding how professional stress and exposure contribute to the increased risk of mortality in Taiwanese dentists.","publish_time":"2012-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shang, Tung-Fu; Chen, Pau-Chung; Wang, Jung-Der","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e9fd8d4bd375552ee024e94b1484664d3932c67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135647.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664612000502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23089692/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664612000502; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2011.06.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Life Table Analysis System"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["overall mortality","premature mortality","excess mortality","increased risk of mortality","Conclusion Taiwanese dentists","all-cause mortality","cohort mortality study","standardized mortality ratios","age-specific mortality rates","Taiwanese internists","general population of Taiwan","multiple risk factors","Cox model","heart diseases","Cox proportional hazard model","significant elevated SMRs","increased hazard ratio","Taiwan Dental Association","potential exposure","overall causes","Reference rates","multiple occupational exposures","Life Table Analysis System","harmful agents","mechanisms","literature","in-depth exploration","Methods","professional stress","survival outcome","Purpose Controversy","gender","Future studies","confidence interval","Background","Results","Careful precaution","trends"],"language":"en"},

We also address needs to tackle bottlenecks to vaccine development\u2014including scientific and financial barriers\u2014and to accelerate the development of vaccines; several actions should be taken: (i) design efficacy trials to be conducted during the course of outbreaks; (ii) evaluate the opportunity for adopting the \u201Canimal rule\u201Dfor demonstration of efficacy for regulatory purposes; (iii) strengthen the collective commitment of nations, international organizations, potential donors and industry; (iv) stimulate public and/or private partnerships to invest in vaccine development and licensure; and (v) identify potential markets for an effective and safe CHIKF vaccine.","publish_time":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rezza, Giovanni; Weaver, Scott C.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab1216072d2b617ce819d2201747699262b5177d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6336248.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653504/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006919","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine development","safe CHIKF vaccine","development of vaccines","licensed vaccine","design efficacy trials","clinical trials","human trials of phase","potential donors","demonstration of efficacy","potential markets","burden of disease","emerging infectious disease","international organizations","alphavirus","industry","collective commitment of nations","outbreak containment","promising candidates","animal rule","financial barriers","private partnerships","bottlenecks","mosquito control programs","preclinical studies","regulatory purposes","needs","update","recent findings","Chikungunya fever","Aedes","mosquitoes","opportunity","actions","licensure","course of outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, careful literature analysis shows that viruses indeed bind to the cell surface via sialic acids, but there is no solid data that these moieties mediate virus entry. In our study, using a number of techniques, we showed that all three viruses are indeed able to bind to sialic acids to a different extent, but these molecules render the cells permissive only for the clinical strain of HCoV-OC43, while for others they serve only as attachment receptors. CRCoV and BCoV appear to employ human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-1) as the entry receptor. Furthermore, we identified heparan sulfate as an alternative attachment factor, but this may be related to the cell culture adaptation, as in ex vivo conditions, it does not seem to play a significant role.

The system comprises the ubiquitin conjugation machinery consisting of an enzyme cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, the deubiquitinases (DUBs) and the proteasome, a multisubunit protease complex acting through an N-terminal threonine protease mechanism. A number of natural product inhibitors of the proteasome have been studied in detail and these inhibitors and their derivatives have been highly valuable in developing our understanding of this system. These efforts culminated in the successful development of bortezomib as a pharmacological agent used clinically as a cancer therapeutic in the treatment of multiple myeloma. This review is focused on natural product inhibitors of the enzymes involved in intracellular ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, ubiquitin ligase E3) and ubiquitin deconjugation (DUBs). Members of both of these enzyme systems have been proposed as pharmacological targets for cancer therapy and several other diseases. Furthermore compounds with activities toward enzymes from the analogous ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein families have been identified for SUMO and NEDD8. To date natural product inhibitors have been described for members of each of these protein families and were isolated from plant, fungal, animal, and microbial sources. Insights into the mechanism of action of natural products and their derivatives will enhance our understanding of this complex system and will improve our ability to rationally design novel inhibitors. The increased availability of assays and research tools for the study of protein ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and Ubl proteins will contribute to the discovery of more potent and selective compounds. We expect that these studies will stimulate development of further potential pharmacological agents in this area.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hess, Wilfried; Mackeen, Mukram M.; Kramer, Holger B.","journal":"Studies in Natural Products Chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444636010000065; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444636010000065","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ubiquitin deconjugation","analogous ubiquitin","ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2","ubiquitin ligase E3","ubiquitin conjugation machinery","intracellular ubiquitin conjugation","proteasome system","number of natural product inhibitors","enzyme E1","protein families","complex system","novel inhibitors","enzyme systems","E3 enzymes","protein turnover","natural products","enzyme cascade of E1","study of protein ubiquitination","pharmacological targets","DUBs","derivatives","Members","understanding","potential pharmacological agents","multisubunit protease complex","cancer therapeutic","cancer therapy","mechanism of action","Ubl proteins","selective compounds","N-terminal threonine protease mechanism","successful development of bortezomib","research tools","discovery","deubiquitination","increased availability of assays","animal","eukaryotic cells","plant","deubiquitinases","treatment of multiple myeloma","microbial sources","area","SUMO","activities","review","efforts","diseases","Insights","studies","NEDD8"],"language":"en"},

The frequent occurrence of cancer in multicellular organisms suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild. This is supported by the fact that wildlife cancers have recently been shown to result in significantly increased levels of mortality and concomitant reduction in fitness. By thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence and etiology in the wild. We were, however, unable to find data on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates. Although single cases of cancer are frequently encountered in the wildlife, we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence for 31 vertebrate species (12 fish, 3 amphibians, 2 reptiles, 2 birds, and 12 mammals). Cancer prevalence among these vertebrates ranged from as low as 0.2% observed in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to more than 50% recorded in both Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) and Cape mountain zebras (Equus zebra zebra). The high prevalence recorded in some vertebrates strongly suggests that cancer in wildlife may indeed carry significant fitness costs. In spite of this, the low number of published comprehensive studies clearly shows that so far cancer in wildlife has received insufficient attention by biologists. We hope that this chapter will act as a catalyst for further studies focusing on the impact of cancer in wild animals. The chapter additionally compares cancer recorded in French zoological parks to those obtained at other zoological parks. Finally, we provide an updated list of cancer recorded as single cases in the wild, as well as in captive animals.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madsen, Thomas; Arnal, Audrey; Vittecoq, Marion; Bernex, Florence; Abadie, Jer\u00F4me; Labrut, Sophie; Garcia, D\u00E9borah; Faug\u00E8re, Dominique; Lemberger, Karin; Beckmann, Christa; Roche, Benjamin; Thomas, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Ujvari, Beata","journal":"Ecology and Evolution of Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0bb1672392f5d6b3a7a56c300cc41deb25b2e1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149733.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128043103000028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128043103000028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada","Santa Catalina Island","Cape"],"keyphrases":["impact of cancer","nontransmissible cancer prevalence","single cases of cancer","updated list of cancer prevalence","frequent occurrence of cancer","wild vertebrates","wild animals","high prevalence","chapter","wildlife cancers","host fitness","significant fitness costs","Equus zebra zebra","significant negative impact","French zoological parks","low number of published comprehensive studies","robust data","Abstract Neoplasia","captive animals","Urocyon littoralis catalinae","Cape mountain zebras","multicellular organisms","Santa Catalina Island foxes","concomitant reduction","parasites","vertebrate species","invertebrates","etiology","increased levels of mortality","amphibians","fish","available literature","insufficient attention","Canada geese","birds","Branta canadensis","reptiles","thorough searches","pathogens","biologists","vast majority of metazoans","spite","fact","catalyst","mammals"],"language":"en"},

GHD/EMPHNET has the scientific expertise to contribute to elevating the level of country alert and preparedness in the EMR and to provide technical support through health promotion, training and training materials, guidelines, coordination, and communication. The FETPs are currently actively participating in surveillance and screening at the ports of entry, development of communication materials and guidelines, and sharing information to health professionals and the public.

Similarly, there are accumulating data suggesting the role of the formation of reactive metabolites/intermediates through bioactivation in herbal toxicity and carcinogenicity. It has been hypothesized that the resultant reactive metabolites following herbal bioactivation covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, leading to toxicity via multiple mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, oncogene activation, and hypersensitivity reactions. This is exemplified by aristolochic acids present in Aristolochia spp, undergoing reduction of the nitro group by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1/2) or peroxidases in extrahepatic tissues to reactive cyclic nitrenium ion. The latter was capable of reacting with DNA and proteins, resulting in activation of H-ras oncogene, gene mutation and finally carcinogenesis. Other examples are pulegone present in essential oils from many mint species; and teucrin A, a diterpenoid found in germander (Teuchrium chamaedrys) used as an adjuvant to slimming diets. Extensive pulegone metabolism generated p-cresol that was a glutathione depletory, and the furan ring of the diterpenoids in germander was oxidized by CYP3A4 to reactive epoxide which reacts with proteins such as CYP3A and epoxide hydrolase. On the other hand, some herbal/dietary constituents were shown to form reactive intermediates capable of irreversibly inhibiting various CYPs. The resultant metabolites lead to CYP inactivation by chemical modification of the heme, the apoprotein, or both as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the apoprotein. Some examples include bergamottin, a furanocoumarin of grapefruit juice; capsaicin from chili peppers; glabridin, an isoflavan from licorice root; isothiocyanates found in all cruciferous vegetables; oleuropein rich in olive oil; dially sulfone found in garlic; and resveratrol, a constituent of red wine. CYPs have been known to metabolize more than 95% therapeutic drugs and activate a number of procarcinogens as well. Therefore, mechanism-based inhibition of CYPs may provide an explanation for some reported herb-drug interactions and chemopreventive activity of herbs. Due to the wide use and easy availability of herbal medicines, there is increasing concern about herbal toxicity. The safety and quality of herbal medicine should be ensured through greater research, pharmacovigilance, greater regulatory control and better communication between patients and health professionals.","publish_time":"2004-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Shufeng; Koh, Hwee-Ling; Gao, Yihuai; Gong, Zhi-yuan; Lee, Edmund Jon Deoon","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2c2392d0aefa8f41f09f9e7c4ed200dd3733b66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127148.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320503009664; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320503009664","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CYP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["herbal toxicity","herbal bioactivation","resultant reactive metabolites","reactive epoxide","formation of reactive metabolites of drugs","reactive intermediates capable","resultant metabolites","drug toxicity","quality of herbal medicine","reactive cyclic nitrenium ion","easy availability of herbal medicines","oncogene activation","pulegone present","cellular proteins","germander","DNA","apoprotein","examples","various CYPs","greater research","ras oncogene","activation of H","therapeutic drugs","epoxide hydrolase","mechanism-based inhibition of CYPs","greater regulatory control","aristolochic acids present","Extensive pulegone metabolism","reported herb-drug interactions","result of covalent binding of modified heme","better communication","olive oil","oleuropein rich","isoflavan","glabridin","nitro group","capsaicin","chili peppers","cruciferous vegetables","dially sulfone","patients","reduction","pharmacovigilance","extrahepatic tissues","direct cytotoxicity","essential oils","furanocoumarin of grapefruit juice","p-cresol","Aristolochia spp","CYP inactivation","hepatic cytochrome P450","resveratrol","isothiocyanates","CYP1A1","garlic","furan ring","gene mutation","chemopreventive activity of herbs","peroxidases","chemical modification","explanation","multiple mechanisms","role","glutathione depletory","licorice root","mint species","wide use","dietary constituents","health professionals","Teuchrium chamaedrys","diterpenoids","bergamottin","CYP3A4","concern","hypersensitivity reactions","constituent of red wine","adjuvant","teucrin","carcinogenesis","safety","hand","carcinogenicity","accumulating data","number of procarcinogens"],"language":"en"},

This has contributed to novel approaches for therapeutic applications including vaccine development and gene therapy-based immunotherapy. Numerous studies in animal tumor models have demonstrated that self-replicating RNA viral vectors can generate antibody responses against infectious agents and tumor cells. Moreover, protection against challenges with pathogenic Ebola virus was obtained in primates immunized with alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Similarly, vaccinated animals have been demonstrated to withstand challenges with lethal doses of tumor cells. Furthermore, clinical trials have been conducted for several indications with self-amplifying RNA viruses. In this context, alphaviruses have been subjected to phase I clinical trials for a cytomegalovirus vaccine generating neutralizing antibodies in healthy volunteers, and for antigen delivery to dendritic cells providing clinically relevant antibody responses in cancer patients, respectively. Likewise, rhabdovirus particles have been subjected to phase I/II clinical trials showing good safety and immunogenicity against Ebola virus. Rhabdoviruses have generated promising results in phase III trials against Ebola virus.

The identification of cis-acting elements required for (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses, however, has been hampered due to insufficiencies in the techniques used to detect the (\u2212)-strand RNA species. Here, we employed a method of head-to-tail ligation and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect and quantitate the synthesis of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) defective interfering (DI) RNA (\u2212) strands. Furthermore, using the aforementioned techniques along with Northern blot assay, we specifically defined the cis-acting RNA elements within the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nucleotides (nts) which function in the synthesis of (\u2212)- or (\u002B)-strand BCoV DI RNA. The major findings are as follows: (i) nts from -5 to -39 within the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts are the cis-acting elements responsible for (\u2212)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, (ii) nts from \u22123 to \u221234 within the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts are cis-acting elements required for (\u002B)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, and (iii) the nucleotide species at the 3\u2032-most position (\u22121) is important, but not critical, for both (\u2212)- and (\u002B)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts in BCoV DI RNA harbor cis-acting RNA elements required for both (\u2212)- and (\u002B)-strand DI RNA synthesis and extend our knowledge on the mechanisms of coronavirus replication. The method of head-to-tail ligation and qRT-PCR employed in the study may also be applied to identify other cis-acting elements required for (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2014-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Wei-Yu; Ke, Ting-Yung; Wu, Hung-Yi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfdfb727440e1010a4189d0c9bee58330c0383dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4031142.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strand RNA synthesis","strand DI RNA synthesis","strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis","strand RNA species","cis-acting RNA elements","positive-strand","negative-strand","cis-acting elements responsible","synthesis of bovine coronavirus","terminal","identification of cis","tail ligation","qRT-PCR","genome replication","coronaviruses","method of head","mechanisms of coronavirus replication","coronaviral genome","aforementioned techniques","nucleotide species","real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","necessary early step","defective interfering","knowledge","Northern blot assay","study","kilobase","nucleotides","strands","major findings","position","insufficiencies","results"],"language":"en"},

When doors are closed, current negative pressure designs are effective for the containment of airborne pathogens in the \u0027dirty\u0027 cubicle with an index patient. When the \u0027dirty\u0027 cubicle door is open, airborne agents can move into the other \u0027clean\u0027 cubicle via the shared anteroom. As the door being opened or closed, the door sweeping effect is the main source of the two-way airflow and contaminant exchange through the doorway. When the dirty cubicle door remains fully open, temperature difference and concentration gradient across the doorway induce the two-way buoyancy-driven flow and transport of airborne agents across the doorway. The longer the dirty cubicle door remains fully open (10 s, 30 s or 60 s) or the smaller the air change rate (34\u20138.5 ACH for each cubicle), the more airborne pathogens are being transported into the \u0027clean\u0027 cubicle and the longer time it takes to remove them after the door is closed. Keeping the door completely open is potentially responsible for the majority of inter-cubicle transmissions if its duration is much longer than the duration of door motion (only 3 s). Our analyses suggest a potential inter-cubicle infection risk if the shared anteroom is used for multiple isolation cubicles. Decreasing the duration of door opening, raising air change rate or using a curtain at the doorway are recommended to reduce inter-cubicle exposure hazards.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hang, Jian; Li, Yuguo; Ching, W.

The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane glycoprotein, increases intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2\u002B) ([Ca(2\u002B)]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis. However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca(2\u002B)]cyto are unknown. We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release. Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic \u03B1-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster. The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity. In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca(2\u002B) by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca(2\u002B)]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells. When [Ca(2\u002B)]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca(2\u002B)]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus replication and virion assembly.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hyser, Joseph M.; Collinson-Pautz, Matthew R.; Utama, Budi; Estes, Mary K.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fefbc58375c244a64a82e3f88c4084076838b88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2999940.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21151776/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00265-10","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NSP4 domain","NSP4 viroporin activity","NSP4 viroporin mutants","type NSP4","viroporin domain","NSP4-mediated elevation","intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca","levels of free cytoplasmic Ca","distinct functions of NSP4","elevation of calcium levels","elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels","low levels","rotavirus replication","viral replication","intracellular calcium homeostasis","puncta formation","assembly sites","rotavirus-infected cells","virion assembly","mechanism","cytoplasmic vesicular structures","amphipathic \u03B1-helical domain","rotavirus nonstructural protein","conserved lysine cluster","membrane integrity","ion homeostasis","virus entry","critical event","epithelial cells","integral membrane insertion","class of small hydrophobic viral proteins","transmembrane glycoprotein","expression of wild","endoplasmic reticulum","structural characteristics of viroporins","amino acids","phospholipase C-independent pathway","Mutational analysis","thapsigargin","membranes","release","viruses","fold","morphogenesis"],"language":"en"},

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus that causes a febrile illness which can progress into chronic arthralgia. The current lack of vaccines and specific treatment for CHIKV infection underscores the need to develop new therapeutic interventions. To discover new antiviral agents, we performed a compound screen in cell culture-based infection models and identified two carbocyclic adenosine analogues, 6\u2032-\u03B2-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (FHA) and 6\u2032-fluoro-homoneplanocin A (FHNA), that displayed potent activity against CHIKV and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) with 50% effective concentrations in the nanomolar range at nontoxic concentrations. The compounds, designed as inhibitors of the host enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, impeded postentry steps in CHIKV and SFV replication. Selection of FHNA-resistant mutants and reverse genetics studies demonstrated that the combination of mutations G230R and K299E in CHIKV nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) conferred resistance to the compounds. Enzymatic assays with purified wild-type (wt) SFV nsP1 suggested that an oxidized (3\u2032-keto) form, rather than FHNA itself, directly inhibited the MTase activity, while a mutant protein with the K231R and K299E substitutions was insensitive to the compound. Both wt nsP1 and the resistant mutant were equally sensitive to the inhibitory effect of SAH. Our combined data suggest that FHA and FHNA inhibit CHIKV and SFV replication by directly targeting the MTase activity of nsP1, rather than through an indirect effect on host SAH hydrolase. The high potency and selectivity of these novel alphavirus mRNA capping inhibitors warrant further preclinical investigation of these compounds.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kovacikova, Kristina; Morren, Bas M.; Tas, Ali; Albulescu, Irina C.; van Rijswijk, Robin; Jarhad, Dnyandev B.; Shin, Young Sup; Jang, Min Hwan; Kim, Gyudong; Lee, Hyuk Woo; Jeong, Lak Shin; Snijder, Eric J.; van Hemert, Martijn J.","journal":"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2352c72c7bc23f051f37e5077eadbd21ea5fbf14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179274.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31964798/; https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.02532-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FHA","SFV","FHNA","SAH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV infection","SFV nsP1","CHIKV nonstructural protein","SFV replication","MTase activity of nsP1","wt nsP1","compounds","Selection of FHNA","host SAH hydrolase","mutant protein","FHA","inhibitory effect of SAH","potent activity","K299E substitutions","resistant mutants","compound screen","nontoxic concentrations","effective concentrations","indirect effect","high potency","\u03B2-fluoro","high morbidity","Chikungunya virus","fluoro-homoneplanocin","novel alphavirus mRNA capping inhibitors","Semliki Forest virus","new antiviral agents","new therapeutic interventions","host enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine","cell culture-based infection models","impeded postentry steps","severe disease","specific treatment","positive-stranded RNA viruses capable","selectivity","reverse genetics studies","purified wild-type","combination of mutations G230R","need","preclinical investigation","nanomolar range","K231R","carbocyclic adenosine analogues","current lack of vaccines","Enzymatic assays","febrile illness","keto","homoaristeromycin","combined data","resistance","chronic arthralgia","Alphaviruses","form"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, classification by virus taxonomists has been focussed on the grouping of relatively closely related viruses. However, during the past few years, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recognized that the taxonomy it develops can be usefully extended to include the basal evolutionary relationships among distantly related viruses. Consequently, the ICTV has changed its Code to allow a 15-rank classification hierarchy that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system and may accommodate the entire spectrum of genetic divergence in the virosphere. The current taxonomies of three human pathogens, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 are used to illustrate the impact of the expanded rank structure. This new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy will stimulate further research on virus origins and evolution, and vice versa, and could promote crosstalk with the taxonomies of cellular organisms.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Nat Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a00aae0558d7f42a37493155c16c54083e4a85ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186216.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0709-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICTV","International Committee"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ebola virus","virus origins","virus taxonomists","Taxonomy of Viruses","new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy","herpes simplex virus","related viruses","rank classification hierarchy","ICTV","expanded rank structure","current taxonomies","taxonomies of cellular organisms","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","human pathogens","International Committee","research","entire spectrum of genetic divergence","years","basal evolutionary relationships","Linnaean taxonomic system","virosphere","past","crosstalk","impact","grouping","discipline","middle","Code","century"],"language":"en"},

This chapter will focus on ncRNAs of both host and viral origin and their roles in retroviral life cycles. Cellular ncRNA represents a significant portion of material packaged into retroviral virions and includes transfer RNAs, 7SL RNA, U RNA, and vault RNA. Initially thought to be random packaging events, these host RNAs are now proposed to contribute to viral assembly and infectivity. Within the cell, long ncRNA and endogenous retroviruses have been found to regulate aspects of the retroviral life cycle in diverse ways. Additionally, the HIV-1 transactivating response element RNA is thought to impact viral infection beyond the well-characterized role as a transcription activator. RNA interference, thought to be an early version of the innate immune response to viral infection, can still be observed in plants and invertebrates today. The ability of retroviral infection to manipulate the host RNAi pathway is described here.

It is the most common indication of pediatric liver transplantation worldwide and the development of new therapies, to alleviate the need of surgical intervention, has been hindered due to its complexity and lack of understanding of the disease pathogenesis. For that reason, significant efforts have been made toward the development of experimental models and strategies to understand the etiology and disease mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic targets. The only characterized model of BA, using a Rhesus Rotavirus Type A infection of newborn BALB/c mice, has enabled the identification of key cellular and molecular targets involved in epithelial injury and duct obstruction. However, the establishment of an unleashed chronic inflammation followed by a progressive pathological wound healing process remains poorly understood.

In this review, we provide an overview of the immunopathogenesis of BA, discuss the implication of innate immunity in the disease pathogenesis and highlight their suitability as therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ortiz-Perez, Ana; Donnelly, Bryan; Temple, Haley; Tiao, Greg; Bansal, Ruchi; Mohanty, Sujit Kumar","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10fd473d3d99f0ac86c9c0d920d6a9e5738c843e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7052372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161597/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00329","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rhesus Rotavirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease pathogenesis","disease mechanisms","devastating fibro-inflammatory disease","macrophages","molecular targets","novel therapeutic targets","immunopathogenesis of BA","characterized model of BA","obstruction of extrahepatic","epithelial injury","duct obstruction","development of new therapies","development of experimental models","different functional programs","infants","M1","infection of newborn BALB","intrahepatic bile ducts","progressive pathological wound healing process","unleashed chronic inflammation","c mice","surrounding cytokine environment","cell response","Rhesus Rotavirus","identification of key cellular","resolutive","strategies","common indication of pediatric liver transplantation","implication of innate immunity","etiology","lack of understanding","suitability","T cells","establishment","M2","overview","need of surgical intervention","fatal consequences","significant efforts","Biliary atresia","reason","complexity","timely manner","review"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, most transmission models have assumed that all purchased cattle carry the same risk of generating outbreaks in the destination herd. Using data on bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Scotland as a case example, this study provides empirical and theoretical evidence that the risk of disease transmission varies substantially based on the animal and herd demographic characteristics at the time of purchase. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that purchasing pregnant heifers and open cows sold with a calf at foot were associated with an increased risk of beef herds being seropositive for BVDV. Based on the results from a dynamic within-herd simulation model, these findings may be partly explained by the age-related probability of animals being persistently infected with BVDV as well as the herd demographic structure at the time of animal introductions. There was also evidence that an epidemiologically important network statistic, \u201Cbetweenness centrality\u201D (a measure frequently associated with the potential for herds to acquire and transmit disease), was significantly higher for herds that supplied these particular types of replacement beef cattle. The trends for dairy herds were not as clear, although there was some evidence that open heifers and open lactating cows were associated with an increased risk of BVDV. Overall, these findings have important implications for developing simulation models that more accurately reflect the industry-level transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases.","publish_time":"2014-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gates, M Carolyn; Humphry, Roger W; Gunn, George J; Woolhouse, Mark E J","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a2a3087f3f753cbfdab460a0a31c0ac64b0cc52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4206702.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323831/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-014-0110-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV"],"locations":["Scotland"],"keyphrases":["increased risk of BVDV","increased risk of beef herds","important cattle diseases","risk of disease transmission","dairy herds","open cows","open heifers","purchased cattle","transmission models","destination herd","herd demographic structure","herd demographic characteristics","herd simulation model","open lactating cows","theoretical evidence","important implications","simulation models","findings","industry-level transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases","particular types of replacement beef cattle","important network statistic","time of animal introductions","pregnant heifers","time of purchase","bovine viral diarrhoea virus","betweenness centrality","study","Scotland","case example","Multivariable logistic regression analysis","data","foot","livestock movements","measure","calf","outbreaks","age-related probability of animals","results","potential","trends"],"language":"en"},

There is, however, a paucity of information on SimEx application to test the functionality of health systems alongside emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Given the important implications health services resilience has for the protection and improvement of human life, this scoping review was undertaken to determine how the publicly available body of existing global SimEx materials considers health systems, together with health security functions in the event of disruptive emergencies. The global review identified 668 articles from literature and 73 products from institutional sources. Relevant screening identified 51 materials suitable to examine from a health system lens using the six health system building blocks as per the WHO Health System Framework. Eight materials were identified for further examination of their ability to test health system functionality from a resilience perspective. SimEx are an effective approach used extensively within health security and emergency response sectors but is not yet adequately used to test health system resilience. Currently available SimEx materials lack an integrated health system perspective and have a limited focus on the quality of services delivered within the context of response to a public health emergency. The materials do not focus on the ability of systems to effectively maintain core services during response. Without adjustment of the scope and focus, currently available SimEx materials do not have the capacity to test health systems to support the development of resilient health systems. Dedicated SimEx materials are urgently needed to fill this gap and harness their potential as an operational tool to contribute to improvements in health systems. They can act as effective global goods to allow testing of different functional aspects of health systems and service delivery alongside emergency preparedness and response. The work was conducted within the scope of the Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Programme, funded by the UK Department for International Development, which seeks to strengthen collaboration between the health system and health security clusters to promote health security and build resilient health systems.","publish_time":"2019-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"McDarby, Geraldine; Reynolds, Lindy; Zibwowa, Zandile; Syed, Shams; Kelley, Ed; Saikat, Sohel","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68ad2dd709c43428a872d1d91ff37534082da3f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6666827.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406594/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001687","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO Health System Framework","UK Department for International Development"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functionality of health systems","health system resilience","health system functionality","health system lens","Health System Framework","health security initiatives","health security functions","health security clusters","public health emergency","International Health Regulations","development of resilient health systems","integrated health system perspective","important implications health services resilience","testing of different functional aspects of health systems","available SimEx materials","ability of systems","Dedicated SimEx materials","SimEx application","materials suitable","emergency response sectors","available body of existing global SimEx materials","allied security sectors","emergency preparedness","context of response","International Development","resilience perspective","global review","effective global goods","quality of services","core services","scope","limited focus","international legislative requirements","established tool","operational tool","effective approach","scoping review","service delivery","literature","protection","Africa Programme","Tackling Deadly Diseases","improvement of human life","defence","UK Department","products","articles","event of disruptive emergencies","improvements","collaboration","capacity","blocks","institutional sources","potential","paucity of information","Relevant screening","recovery","examination","Simulation Exercises","adjustment","gap"],"language":"en"},

This is particularly worrisome since most of the highly pathogenic and emerging viruses are, and will likely continue to be, RNA viruses. These viruses can cause acute, severe illness, including severe respiratory disease, hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, with a high case fatality rate. It is important to have potent and safe drugs at hand that can be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of such infections. Drugs approved for the treatment of RNA virus infections (other than HIV) are the influenza M2 channel inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine; the influenza neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, and ribavirin for the treatment of infections with respiratory syncytial virus and hepatitis C virus. The molecular mechanism(s) by which ribavirin inhibits viral replication, such as depletion of intracellular GTP pools and induction of error catastrophe, may not readily allow the design of analogues that are more potent/selective than the parent drug. Highly pathogenic RNA viruses belong to a variety of virus families, each having a particular replication strategy, thus offering a wealth of potential targets to selectively inhibit viral replication. We here provide a non-exhaustive review of potential experimental strategies, using small molecules, to inhibit the replication of several RNA viruses. Other approaches, such as the use of interferon or other host-response modifiers, immune serum or neutralizing antibodies, are not addressed in this review.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leyssen, Pieter; De Clercq, Erik; Neyts, Johan","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3ba3b0b2e19d8bfb1d982128dab886ff43b62a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114363.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208000247; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.01.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208000247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18313769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenic RNA viruses","treatment of RNA virus infections","treatment of infections","emerging viruses","viral replication","respiratory syncytial virus","hepatitis C virus","variety of virus families","ribavirin","safe drugs","particular replication strategy","severe respiratory disease","influenza neuraminidase inhibitors","antiviral drugs available","severe illness","influenza M2 channel inhibitors","non-exhaustive review of potential experimental strategies","wealth of potential targets","encephalitis","rimantadine","amantadine","host-response modifiers","immune serum","depletion of intracellular GTP pools","zanamivir","HIV","hemorrhagic fever","induction of error catastrophe","small molecules","oseltamivir","neutralizing antibodies","high case fatality rate","use of interferon","parent drug","hand","molecular mechanism","design of analogues","Abstract","prophylaxis","approaches"],"language":"en"},

Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS in China hardest-hit areas a month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 7%. Women reported significant higher PTSS in the domains of re-experiencing, negative alterations in cognition or mood, and hyper-arousal. Participants with better sleep quality or less frequency of early awakenings reported lower PTSS.

Data from China as well as risk models suppose that cancer patients, particularly those on active, immunosuppressive therapies are at higher risks of severe infection from the illness. In addition, staff illness and restructuring of services to deal with the crisis will inevitably place treatment capacities under significant strain. These guidelines aim to expand on those provided by NHS England regarding cancer care during the coronavirus pandemic by examining the known literature and provide guidance in managing patients with urothelial and rarer urinary tract cancers.

As a result, it is recommended that this guidance will help form a framework for shared decision making with patients. Moreover, they do not advise a one-size-fits-all approach but recommend continual assessment of the situation with discussion within and between centres.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Karan; Choudhury, Ananya; Hoskin, Peter; Varughese, Mohini; James, Nicholas; Huddart, Robert; Birtle, Alison","journal":"Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fb662f382f5c37b249657e3d71c1bb89de4f1e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2020.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0936655520301618?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0936655520301618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NHS England"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["cancer patients","cancer care","cancer patient care","current situation","guidance","coronavirus pandemic","estimated risk","risk models","staff illness","current COVID","substantial obstacle","higher risks of severe infection","rarer urinary tract cancers","benefits of standard treatments","immunosuppressive therapies","continual assessment","known literature","treatment capacities","approach","discussion","restructuring of services","alternatives","framework","NHS England","significant strain","crisis","addition","China","shared decision","size-fits","centres","Data","guidelines","result"],"language":"en"},

The early history of mAAP relates to its role as Cys-Gly dipeptidase or cysteinyl-glycinase. It was proposed that this peptidase activity present in apparently purified RNA preparations contributed to polypeptide biosynthesis by acting in reverse in a sequential fashion. mAAP has a broad substrate specificity removing N-terminal amino acids (Xaa-Xbb-) from almost all unsubstituted oligopeptides and from an amide or arylamide. mAAP is a type II integral membrane protein located on the plasma membrane as an ectoenzyme. The pI is approximately 5. mAAP is widely distributed among species and tissues although it is of greatest abundance in brush border membranes of the kidney, in the mucosal cells of the small intestine and in the liver. It is also present in the lung where it is identical to the pI46 type II alveolar epithelial cell antigen and is located on endothelial cells in blood vessels. On polarized epithelial cells, mAAP is localized to the apical domain and is targeted there through an apical sorting signal thought to be located in the catalytic head group region of the protein.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turner, Anthony J.","journal":"Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6444932de210004361712f9f6fe5efb0ecac77aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012079611350077X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012079611350077X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early history of mAAP","plasma membrane","integral membrane protein","endothelial cells","mucosal cells","polarized epithelial cells","pI46 type","apical domain","structural chemistry of membrane alanyl aminopeptidase","peptidase activity present","alveolar epithelial cell antigen","apical sorting signal thought","N-terminal amino acids","broad substrate specificity","RNA preparations","greatest abundance","brush border membranes","Xaa-Xbb","Cys-Gly dipeptidase","kidney","role","catalytic head group region","reverse","chapter","polypeptide biosynthesis","small intestine","cysteinyl-glycinase","unsubstituted oligopeptides","tissues","blood vessels","Publisher Summary","sequential fashion","arylamide","liver","ectoenzyme","species","lung"],"language":"en"},

Due to current technological deficiencies, accurate determination of the presence of airborne viruses is challenging. This shortcoming limits our ability to evaluate the actual threat arising from inhalation or other relevant contact with aerosolized viruses. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms of airborne transmission of viruses, air sampling technologies that can detect the presence of aerosolized viruses, effectively collect them and maintain their viability, and determine their distribution in aerosol particles, are needed. The latest developments in sampling and detection methodologies for airborne viruses, their limitations, factors that can affect their performance and current research needs, are discussed in this review. Much more work is needed on the establishment of standard air sampling methods and their performance requirements. Sampling devices that can collect a wide size range of virus\u2010containing aerosols and maintain the viability of the collected viruses are needed. Ideally, the devices would be portable and technology\u2010enabled for on\u2010the\u2010spot detection and rapid identification of the viruses.

The nucleolus is a multifunctional nuclear domain, which, in addition to its well-known role in ribosome biogenesis, plays several crucial other functions. Viral infection induces important nucleolar alterations. Indeed, during viral infection numerous viral components localize in nucleoli, while various host nucleolar proteins are redistributed in other cell compartments or are modified, and non-nucleolar cellular proteins reach the nucleolus. This review highlights the interactions reported between the nucleolus and some human or animal viral families able to establish a latent or productive infection, selected on the basis of their known interactions with the nucleolus and the nucleolar activities, and their links with virus replication and/or pathogenesis.

The \u2018macro fold\u2019 is roughly 25kDa in size and is composed of a mixed \u03B1\u2013\u03B2 fold with similarity to the P loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. They function as binding modules for metabolites of NAD\u002B, including poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), which is synthesized by PAR polymerases (PARPs). Although there is a high degree of sequence similarity within this family, particularly for residues that might be involved in catalysis or substrates binding, it is likely that the sequence variation that does exist among macro domains is responsible for the specificity of function of individual proteins. Recent findings have indicated that macro domain proteins are functionally promiscuous and are implicated in the regulation of diverse biological functions, such as DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Significant advances in the field of macro domain have occurred in the past few years, including biological insights and the discovery of novel signaling pathways. To provide a framework for understanding these recent findings, this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the known and proposed biochemical, cellular and physiological roles of the macro domain family. Recent data that indicate a critical role of macro domain regulation for the proper progression of cellular differentiation programs will be discussed. In addition, the effect of dysregulated expression of macro domain proteins will be considered in the processes of tumorigenesis and bacterial pathogenesis. Finally, a series of observations will be highlighted that should be addressed in future efforts to develop macro domains as effective therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Weidong; Li, Xiaolei; Fu, Xiaobing","journal":"Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c4d635531098c4f3f7b41e5980306e76ab703c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110529.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383574211000056; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21421074/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574211000056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAD","PAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["macro fold","macro domain family","field of macro domain","Abstract Macro domains","critical role of macro domain regulation","effect of dysregulated expression of macro domain proteins","conserved domains","Recent findings","transcriptional regulation","individual proteins","Recent data","regulation of diverse biological functions","biological insights","\u03B2 fold","high degree of sequence similarity","sequence variation","specificity of function","substrates binding","binding modules","PAR polymerases","proper progression of cellular differentiation programs","DNA repair","P loop","physiological roles","chromatin remodeling","past","metabolites of NAD","mixed \u03B1","effective therapeutic targets","nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases","discovery of novel","review","comprehensive overview","processes of tumorigenesis","ADP-ribose","Significant advances","future efforts","bacterial pathogenesis","addition","catalysis","years","kDa","pathways","size","PARPs","residues","framework","kingdoms of life","series of observations"],"language":"en"},

The content of pitcher fluids has been the focus of many fluid protein profiling studies. These studies suggest an evolutionary convergence of a conserved group of similar enzymes in diverse families of pitcher plants. A recent study showed that endogenous proteins were replenished in the pitcher fluid, which indicates a feedback mechanism in protein secretion. This poses an interesting question on the physiological effect of plant protein loss. However, there is no study to date that describes the pitcher response to endogenous protein depletion. To address this gap of knowledge, we previously performed a comparative RNA-sequencing experiment of newly opened pitchers (D0) against pitchers after 3 days of opening (D3C) and pitchers with filtered endogenous proteins (\u003E10 kDa) upon pitcher opening (D3L). Nepenthes ampullaria was chosen as a model study species due to their abundance and unique feeding behaviour on leaf litters. The analysis of unigenes with top 1% abundance found protein translation and stress response to be overrepresented in D0, compared to cell wall related, transport, and signalling for D3L. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis identified DEGs with functional enrichment in protein regulation, secondary metabolism, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport. The transcriptomic landscape of the pitcher dramatically shifted towards intracellular transport and defence response at the expense of energy metabolism and photosynthesis upon endogenous protein depletion. This is supported by secretome, transportome, and transcription factor analysis with RT-qPCR validation based on independent samples. This study provides the first glimpse into the molecular responses of pitchers to protein loss with implications to future cost/benefit analysis of carnivorous pitcher plant energetics and resource allocation for adaptation in stochastic environments.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Hoe-Han; Baharin, Anis; Mohd Salleh, Faris \u2018Imadi; Ravee, Rishiesvari; Wan Zakaria, Wan Nor Adibah; Mohd Noor, Normah","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b0afab4b1d7973d1400d79114798bc05d1c2748.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170878.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313042/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63696-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nepenthes","Differentially"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pitcher response","protein secretion","endogenous protein depletion","protein regulation","protein translation","Carnivorous pitcher plants","content of pitcher fluids","specialised pitcher organs","diverse families of pitcher plants","fluid protein profiling studies","benefit analysis of carnivorous pitcher plant energetics","physiological effect of plant protein loss","opened pitchers","intracellular transport","analysis of unigenes","recent study","filtered endogenous proteins","abundance","stress response","transcription factor analysis","defence response","molecular responses of pitchers","D0","vesicular transport","model study species","D3L","secondary metabolism","hydrolytic enzymes","intracellular trafficking","acidic fluids","days of opening","expense of energy metabolism","conserved group of similar enzymes","resource allocation","future cost","DEGs","functional enrichment","implications","prey digestion","secretory glands","RT-qPCR validation","adaptation","photosynthesis","focus","unique feeding behaviour","D3C","kDa","comparative RNA-sequencing experiment","leaf litters","evolutionary convergence","nutrient absorption","feedback mechanism","stochastic environments","transportome","cell wall","glimpse","independent samples","interesting question","secretome","signalling","date","Nepenthes ampullaria","transcriptomic landscape","gap of knowledge"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this analysis is to define those micro-organisms that may contaminate the bronchoscope during the examination and that may cause disease in other patients. Methods Research of literature and analysis of laboratory data. Results During the passage of the respiratory tract the bronchoscope will be contaminated by the physiological flora of oral cavity, nasopharynx, trachea, bronchi, and pulmonary tissues. Whilst the oral cavity, the nasopharynx and the pharynx are the habitat for a great variety of bacteria the lower respiratory tract is virtually free of micro-organisms. However, in ventilated patients trachea and bronchi can become colonized as the result of bypassing the cleansing effect of the ciliated epithelium. In addition all agents that can cause bronchitis or pneumonia in immunocompromised or otherwise healthy individuals are potential contaminants of bronchoscopes. These microorganisms include bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts and moulds, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and rarely parasites. The bronchoscopic procedure can result in epithelial injury with subsequent bleeding. Therefore, all blood-borne pathogens, e.g. HIV or HBV are also potential contaminants of the bronchoscope. There are several reports of transmission of micro-organisms due to incomplete or faulty cleaning and disinfection procedures of bronchoscopes. These incidents include nearly all classes of micro-organisms but not parasites or viruses. However, the incubation period of viruses can be long and the association between bronchoscopy and infection may be obscure. Endospore forming micro-organisms and parasites are not part of the normal flora of the respiratory tract and may rarely cause disease, usually only in severely immunocompromised patients, but transmission of such organisms by bronchoscopy has never been reported. Conclusion The antimicrobial activity of the disinfection process, including chemical disinfectants for endoscopes has to include bacteria, fungi and viruses. Sporicidal activity may be only warranted in specific patient populations, i.e. after bronchoscopy of suspected anthrax patients or before examination of severely immunocompromised patients.","publish_time":"2008-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wendt, Constanze; Kampf, Birgit","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a2ebe61bc67b4f57b6af20d70a3636ee22e5337.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18994685/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670108600146; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670108600146; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0195-6701(08)60014-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunocompromised patients","free of micro-organisms","classes of micro-organisms","parasites","ventilated patients trachea","bronchoscopy of suspected anthrax patients","lower respiratory tract","potential contaminants of bronchoscopes","non-enveloped viruses","nasopharynx","disinfection procedures of bronchoscopes","physical examination","incubation period of viruses","disease","physiological flora of oral cavity","great variety of bacteria","Summary Processing of bronchoscopes","disinfection process","normal flora","antimicrobial activity","reports of transmission","Sporicidal activity","following patient","analysis of laboratory data","specific patient populations","moulds","faulty cleaning","healthy individuals","epithelial injury","endoscopes","yeasts","pneumonia","HIV","habitat","chemical disinfectants","cleansing effect","Methods Research of literature","bronchitis","mycobacteria","HBV","passage","ciliated epithelium","agents","pathogens","bronchoscopic procedure","subsequent bleeding","microorganisms","Conclusion","pulmonary tissues","association","fungi","addition","blood","Results","incidents","Endospore","aim"],"language":"en"},

We generated recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) LC16m8 strain which simultaneously expresses four structural proteins of SARS-CoV, including nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E), spike (S) proteins (rVV-NMES) and reported that old BALB/c mice having prior immunization with rVV-NMES develop severe pneumonia similar to those of control mice though rVV-NMES-immunized mice showed lower pulmonary viral titer than in the control mice. Furthermore, we determined which SARS-CoV structural protein for the prior rVV-immunization is responsible for the severe pneumonia after the SARS-CoV infection as observed in the rVV-NMES-immunized mice. Old BALB/c mice were inoculated intradermally with rVV that expressed each structural proteins of SARS-CoV (rVV-N, -M, -E, or -S) with or without rVV-S and then infected intranasally with SARS-CoV more than 4 weeks later. At 9 days after SARS-CoV infection, the rVV-N-immunized mice show more severe pneumonia than in other groups. Furthermore, significant up-regulation of Th1 (IL-2)- and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5)-bias cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-\u03B2) were observed in rVV-N-immunized mice, resulting in the intensive infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the lung. In contrast, rVV-S-immunized mice showed only low pulmonary viral tier and slight pneumonia. However, the mice having co-immunization with both rVV-N and rVV-S showed severe pneumonia though their pulmonary viral titer was low. These results suggest that an excessive host immune response against the N protein of SARS-CoV is involved in severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV infection. These findings increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yasui, Fumihiko; Kai, Chieko; Saito, Kousuke; Inoue, Shingo; Yoneda, Misako; Morita, Kouichi; Mizuno, Kyosuke; Kohara, Michinori","journal":"Procedia in Vaccinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0d6f76af8ad26a7f3a1efe0a089cf4de5d2ef57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877282X1000010X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.provac.2010.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288911/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877282X1000010X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rVV-S","rVV-NMES","SARS-CoV infection","immunized mice","N protein of SARS","SARS-CoV structural protein","pathogenesis of SARS","prior rVV-immunization","c mice","control mice","structural proteins of SARS","SARS-associated coronavirus","severe pneumonia similar","slight pneumonia","prior immunization","lower pulmonary viral titer","low pulmonary viral tier","co-immunization","old BALB","precise mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome","regulation of Th1","regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine","LC16m8 strain","excessive host immune response","recombinant vaccinia virus","intensive infiltration of immunocompetent cells","spike","nucleocapsid","bias cytokines","lung","results","understanding","TGF-\u03B2","Th2","days","contrast","findings","membrane","groups","weeks"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV2 is an enveloped virus and E proteins present in them are reported to form ion channels, which is mainly associated with pathogenesis. Thus, there is always a quest to inhibit these ion channels, which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV2 in humans. Considering this, in the present study, authors employed computational approaches for studying the structure as well as function of the human \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein as well as its interaction with various phytochemicals. Result obtained revealed that \u03B1-helix and loops present in this protein experience random movement under optimal condition, which in turn modulate ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates. However, after binding with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E, and Vibsanol B, the random motion of the human \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein gets reduced, this, in turn, inhibits the function of the \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein.

Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, in cellulo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments, and in vitro pulldown assays, we have now identified the key residues on the nsp10 surface that interact with nsp14. The functional consequences of mutations introduced at these positions were first evaluated biochemically by monitoring nsp14 exoribonuclease activity. Disruption of the nsp10-nsp14 interaction abrogated the nsp10-driven activation of the nsp14 exoribonuclease. We further showed that the nsp10 surface interacting with nsp14 overlaps with the surface involved in the nsp10-mediated activation of nsp16 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity, suggesting that nsp10 is a major regulator of SARS-CoV replicase function. In line with this notion, reverse genetics experiments supported an essential role of the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 in SARS-CoV replication, as several mutations that abolished the interaction in vitro yielded a replication-negative viral phenotype. In contrast, mutants in which the nsp10-nsp16 interaction was disturbed proved to be crippled but viable. These experiments imply that the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 and nsp16 and possibly other subunits of the viral replication complex may be a target for the development of antiviral compounds against pathogenic coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2014-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouvet, Micka\u00EBl; Lugari, Adrien; Posthuma, Clara C.; Zevenhoven, Jessika C.; Bernard, St\u00E9phanie; Betzi, St\u00E9phane; Imbert, Isabelle; Canard, Bruno; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; L\u00E9cine, Patrick; Pfefferle, Susanne; Drosten, Christian; Snijder, Eric J.; Decroly, Etienne; Morelli, Xavier","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c808733cdd3d3bbd4da5c98546b0bf1809b3cc30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4162180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074927/; http://www.jbc.org/content/289/37/25783.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m114.577353","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp10-nsp14 interaction","nsp10-nsp16 interaction","nsp10 surface interacting","nsp14 overlaps","nsp10-driven activation","nsp10-mediated activation of nsp16","monitoring nsp14 exoribonuclease activity","amino acid nsp10 subunit","SARS-CoV replication","viral replication complex","O-methyltransferase activity","replication-negative viral phenotype","major regulator of SARS","reverse genetics experiments","CoV replicase function","O-methyltransferase activities","cellulo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments","functional consequences of mutations","severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus","target","essential role","development of antiviral compounds","mutagenesis","subunits","RNA-synthesizing machinery","zinc fingers","pathogenic coronaviruses","notion","pulldown assays","line","positions","mutants","key residues","Disruption","non-structural proteins","alanine","contrast","ORF1a"],"language":"en"},

In this study, global mapping of H3K4me3 and transcriptomic analyses in the jejunum of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected and healthy piglets were performed by using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq techniques. A subset of genes and H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) histone modifications that are associated with PEDV infections were identified. The results revealed previously unknown and intriguing elements involved in the regulation of genes responsive to PEDV infections, which may aid in identifying key regulators and genetic resistant markers for PEDV infections. ABSTRACT: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is currently detected as the main pathogen causing severe diarrhea in pig farms. The phenotypic alterations induced by pathogenic infections are usually tightly linked with marked changes in epigenetic modification and gene expression. We performed global mapping of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and transcriptomic analyses in the jejunum of PEDV-infected and healthy piglets using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq techniques. A total of 1885 H3K4me3 peaks that are associated with 1723 genes were characterized. Moreover, 290 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 104 up-regulated and 186 down-regulated genes. Several antiviral genes including 2\u2019-5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), 2\u2019-5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), ephrin B2 (EFNB2), and CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B) with higher H3K4me3 enrichment and expression levels in PEDV-infected samples suggested the potential roles of H3K4me3 deposition in promoting their expressions. Transcription factor annotation analysis highlighted the potential roles of two transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) and Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4) in modulating the differential expression of genes involved in PEDV infection. The results provided novel insights into PEDV infection from the transcriptomic and epigenetic layers and revealed previously unknown and intriguing elements potentially involved in the host responses.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Haifei; Yang, Li; Qu, Huan; Feng, Haiyue; Wu, Shenglong; Bao, Wenbin","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c179446abc96980232e34b4e910f2c184301c07f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6719071.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9080523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382472/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infections","jejunum of PEDV","regulated genes","PEDV-infected samples","subset of genes","antiviral genes","differential expression of genes","H3K4me3 peaks","global mapping of H3K4me3","jejunum of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","regulation of genes responsive","potential roles of H3K4me3 deposition","higher H3K4me3 enrichment","transcriptomic analyses","severe diarrhea","pathogenic infections","chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing","expression levels","healthy piglets","gene expression","global mapping of H3K4 trimethylation","RNA-seq techniques","intriguing elements","results","oligoadenylate synthetase","transcription factors interferon regulatory factor","Transcription factor annotation analysis","epigenetic modification","epigenetic layers","CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit","CKS1B","EFNB2","IRF8","genetic resistant markers","histone modifications","OAS2","marked changes","SIMPLE SUMMARY","key regulators","main pathogen","pig farms","novel insights","ephrin B2","Kruppel","KLF4","ABSTRACT","health of suckling pigs","phenotypic alterations","study","host responses","OAS1","total","expressions"],"language":"en"},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infection and may be involved in the mammalian immune response. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected swine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. The reads were aligned to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miRBase 19, identifying 284 annotated miRNAs. Certain miRNAs were differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 unique miRNAs displayed significant differentially expression between the normal and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 44 were significantly down-regulated. Stem-loop RT-PCR was carried out to determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples, and the results were consistent with those of sequencing. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of host target genes demonstrated that the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks, including cellular process, metabolic process, immune system process. This is the first report of the identification of ST cell miRNAs and the comprehensive analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, which revealed the miRNA molecular regulatory mechanisms for the viral infection, expression of viral genes and the expression of immune-related genes.

The river buffalo is reared mainly for milk, whereas the swamp buffalo is reared mainly for draught. Only 3% of the world buffalo population is reared in the Mediterranean region. Significant numbers of buffaloes are at present found only in Italy, Romania, Egypt, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Iran. In all these countries, buffaloes represent only a very small portion of total livestock, except in Egypt, where buffaloes are more numerous than cattle. Because of the strong market demand for buffalo cheese, the number of buffaloes has increased in Italy and there is a preference for buffalo dairy products compared to cows\u0027 milk products in a few countries.

MERS emerged in 2012 and has a high mortality associated with severe lung disease. A lack of autopsy studies from MERS fatalities has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We investigated the spatial and cellular localization of DPP4 to evaluate an association MERS clinical disease. DPP4 was rarely detected in the surface epithelium from nasal cavity to conducting airways with a slightly increased incidence in distal airways. DPP4 was also found in a subset of mononuclear leukocytes and in serous cells of submucosal glands. In the parenchyma, DPP4 was found principally in type I and II cells and alveolar macrophages and was also detected in vascular endothelium (eg, lymphatics) and pleural mesothelia. Patients with chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, exhibited increased DPP4 immunostaining in alveolar epithelia (type I and II cells) and alveolar macrophages with similar trends in reactive mesothelia. This finding suggests that preexisting pulmonary disease could increase MERS-CoV receptor abundance and predispose individuals to MERS morbidity and mortality, which is consistent with current clinical observations. We speculate that the preferential spatial localization of DPP4 in alveolar regions may explain why MERS is characterized by lower respiratory tract disease.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyerholz, David K.; Lambertz, Allyn M.; McCray, Paul B.","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4efaa6979804c81f0af813a8352abc0df1f08a9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ee85fc403280eda861fa1dc3b2446155219476f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4715219.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944015005763; http://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002944015005763/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597880/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944015005763; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.09.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["MERS fatalities","understanding of MERS","MERS morbidity","association MERS clinical disease","MERS-CoV receptor abundance","chronic lung disease","increased DPP4 immunostaining","cellular localization of DPP4","alveolar macrophages","severe lung disease","type","preferential spatial localization of DPP4","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","alveolar epithelia","alveolar regions","lower respiratory tract disease","CoV pathogenesis","increased incidence","serous cells of submucosal glands","high mortality","distal airways","reactive mesothelia","pleural mesothelia","current clinical observations","Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cystic fibrosis","individuals","similar trends","CD26","subset of mononuclear leukocytes","lack of autopsy studies","lymphatics","nasal cavity","surface epithelium","transmembrane ectopeptidase","Dipeptidyl peptidase","Patients","vascular endothelium","parenchyma"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing. METHODS: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%. INTERPRETATION: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

It has been argued that such clonal interference may have led to the evolution of sex and recombination in well-mixed populations. Here, we study clonal interference, and mechanisms of its mitigation, in an evolutionary model of spatially structured populations with uniform selection pressure. Clonal interference is much more prevalent with spatial structure than without, due to the slow wave-like spread of beneficial mutations through space. We find that the adaptation speed of asexuals saturates when the linear habitat size exceeds a characteristic interference length, which becomes shorter with smaller migration and larger mutation rate. The limiting speed is proportional to \u03BC(1/2) and \u03BC(1/3) in linear and planar habitats, respectively, where the mutational supply \u03BC is the product of mutation rate and local population density. This scaling and the existence of a speed limit should be amenable to experimental tests as they fall far below predicted adaptation speeds for well-mixed populations (that scale as the logarithm of population size). Finally, we show that not only recombination, but also long-range migration is a highly efficient mechanism of relaxing clonal competition in structured populations. Our conservative estimates of the interference length predict prevalent clonal interference in microbial colonies and biofilms, so clonal competition should be a strong driver of both genetic and spatial mixing in those contexts.","publish_time":"2011-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martens, Erik A.; Hallatschek, Oskar","journal":"Genetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cdfc63c3790d0bc50c45fe33b2b7ca304641a5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3213383.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900264/; https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.111.130112","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalent clonal interference","structured populations","characteristic interference length","large populations","well-mixed populations","Beneficial mutations","adaptation speed of asexuals","efficient mechanism of relaxing clonal competition","speed limit","beneficial substitutions","adaptation speeds","limiting speed","recombination","product of mutation rate","larger mutation rate","linear habitat size","mutational supply \u03BC","logarithm of population size","smaller migration","long-range migration","spatial mixing","fundamental problem of asexual adaptation","spatial structure","local population density","microbial colonies","biofilms","strong driver","evolutionary model","evolution of sex","uniform selection pressure","mitigation","experimental tests","conservative estimates","contexts","existence","mechanisms","planar habitats","slow wave","scaling","space","fixation"],"language":"en"},

To assess a proxy for amount of national primate trades, we quantified the number of reports of native primate species featuring in unique web news reports from 2000 to 2017, including accuracy of their identification, location where they were confiscated or rescued, and their condition upon rescue. To measure temporal trends across these categories, the time span was divided into three sections: 2000\u20132005, 2006\u20132011 and 2012\u20132017. A total of 735 individuals of 14 species were reported in 372 news reports, mostly rhesus macaques (n = 165, 22.5%, Macaca mulatta) and two species of slow lorises (n = 487, 66.3%, Nycticebus spp.). During the same period, live individuals of rhesus macaques were recorded 206 times (70,949 individuals) in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Trade Database, whereas slow lorises were only recorded four times (nine individuals), indicating that the species originated illegally from China or were illegally imported into China. Due to their rescued locations in residential areas (n = 211, 56.7%), most primates appeared to be housed privately as pets. A higher proportion of \u2018market\u2019 rescues during 2006\u20132011 (\u03C7(2) = 8.485, df = 2, p = 0.014), could be partly attributed to an intensive management on wildlife markets since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. More than half (68.3%, 502 individuals) of the primate individuals were unhealthy, injured or dead when rescued. Thus, identification and welfare training and capacity-building should be provided to husbandry and veterinary professionals, as well as education to the public through awareness initiatives.

For LAMP detection, a SPR based LAMP sensing system (SPRLAMP) was constructed, including a novel SPRLAMP sensing cartridge integrating a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) micro-reactor with a polycarbonate (PC)-based prism coated with a 50nm Au film. First, we found that the change of refractive index of the bulk solution was approximately 0.0011 refractive index (RI) units after LAMP reaction. The PC-based prism\u0027s linearity and thermal responses were compared to those of a traditional glass prism to show that a PC-based prism can be used for SPR measurement. Finally, the HBV template mixed in the 10\u03BCl LAMP solution could be detected by SPRLAMP system in 17min even at the detection-limited concentration of 2fg/ml. We also analyzed the correlation coefficients between the initial concentrations of HBV DNA templates and the system response (\u0394RU) at varying amplification times to establish an optimal amplification time endpoint of 25min (R 2 =0.98). In conclusion, the LAMP reaction could be detected with the SPRLAMP sensing cartridge based on direct sensing of the bulk refractive index.","publish_time":"2012-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuang, Tsung-Liang; Wei, Shih-Chung; Lee, Szu-Yuan; Lin, Chii-Wann","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63ecda7e10a99da81620bb39829c7deb9502842c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22209071/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566311007810; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566311007810; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPR","LAMP","HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAMP sensing system","LAMP detection","LAMP reaction","SPRLAMP system","novel SPRLAMP sensing cartridge","direct sensing","\u03BCl LAMP solution","PC-based prism\u0027s linearity","bulk refractive index","change of refractive index","isothermal amplification","on-site detection","system response","bulk solution","SPR measurement","HBV template","varying amplification times","detection-limited concentration","traditional glass prism","optimal amplification time endpoint","initial concentrations of HBV DNA templates","polymethyl methacrylate","micro-reactor","PMMA","\u0394RU","polycarbonate","low-cost surface plasmon resonance","hepatitis B virus","method","units","loop","thermal responses","correlation coefficients","fg","nm Au film","study","conclusion","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the suitability of Advax\u2122, a stable particulate polymorph of inulin, also referred to as delta inulin, as a mucosal adjuvant for whole inactivated influenza vaccine (WIV) administered either as a liquid or dry powder formulation. Spray freeze-drying produced Advax-adjuvanted WIV powder particles in a size range (1\u20135 \u03BCm) suitable for inhalation. The physical and biological characteristics of both WIV and Advax remained unaltered both by admixing WIV with Advax and by spray freeze drying. Upon intranasal or pulmonary immunization, both liquid and dry powder formulations containing Advax induced significantly higher systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses than non-adjuvanted WIV formulations. Furthermore, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV led to robust memory B cell responses along with an increase of lung localization factors i.e. CXCR3, CD69, and CD103. A less pronounced but still positive effect of Advax was seen on memory T cell responses. In contrast to animals immunized with WIV alone, all animals pulmonary immunized with a single dose of Advax-adjuvanted WIV were fully protected with no visible clinical symptoms against a lethal dose of influenza virus. These data confirm that Advax is a potent mucosal adjuvant that boosts vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses both in the lung and systemically with major positive effects on B-cell memory and complete protection against live virus. Hence, respiratory tract immunization, particularly via the lungs, with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation as a liquid or dry powder is a promising alternative to parenteral influenza vaccination.","publish_time":"2018-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomar, Jasmine; Patil, Harshad P.; Bracho, Gustavo; Tonnis, Wouter F.; Frijlink, Henderik W.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Vanbever, Rita; Huckriede, Anke; Hinrichs, Wouter L.J.","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe530f61e28057f70673651546c7ae571d2d984e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111335.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016836591830525X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016836591830525X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218687/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spray"],"organizations":["WIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation","Advax-adjuvanted WIV powder particles","suitability of Advax","admixing WIV","single dose of Advax","positive effect of Advax","non-adjuvanted WIV formulations","liquid","dry powder formulations","pulmonary immunization","memory T cell responses","B-cell memory","cellular immune responses","inactivated influenza vaccine","parenteral influenza vaccination","robust memory B cell responses","lethal dose of influenza virus","respiratory tract immunization","site of influenza exposure","animals pulmonary immunized","Abstract Administration of influenza vaccines","potent mucosal adjuvant","conventional parenteral administration","Spray freeze-drying","live virus","delta inulin","major positive effects","increase of lung localization factors","stable particulate polymorph of inulin","potential benefits","promising alternative","CXCR3","complete protection","size range","CD69","immunity","visible clinical symptoms","lungs","\u03BCm","biological characteristics","inhalation","CD103","data","contrast","study"],"language":"en"},

Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide an up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concern about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concern about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Hage, Wissam; Hingray, Coraline; Lemogne, C\u00E9dric; Yrondi, Antoine; Brunault, Paul; Bienvenu, Thomas; Etain, Bruno; Paquet, Claire; Gohier, B\u00E9n\u00E9dicte; Bennabi, Djamila; Birmes, Philippe; Sauvaget, Anne; Fakra, Eric; Prieto, Nathalie; Bulteau, Samuel; Vidailhet, Pierre; Jollant, Fabrice; Camus, Vincent; Leboyer, Marion; Krebs, Marie-Odile; Aouizerate, Bruno","journal":"Encephale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370984/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["health of self","occupational health","training health care professionals","exposure of health professionals","mental health symptoms","large-scale health crisis","tragic health crisis","mental health risk factors","recovery of health care workers","potential mental health risks","competent care","reorganization of health service delivery","pandemic","important component of public health measures","continuing care units","organizational factors","current COVID","medical intensive care units","personal factors","rapid spread of COVID","mental help","mental well-being","intensive care unit beds necessary","up-to-date information","disease characteristics","crisis management","lack of access","changing information","relevant literature","Reporting information","relevant results","relevant data","feelings of uncertainty","coronavirus disease","major sanitary crisis","medical literature","lack of knowledge","social stigmatization","psychological adjustment","rapid access","psychological distress","general climate of uncertainty","Concerns","increased risk of high levels of stress","lack of specific drugs","long-term psychological implications","future prevention strategies","emergency services","emergency aid","post-traumatic stress disorder","response strategies","family members","family life","ill patients","recent data","severity of symptoms","generalized climate of wariness","depletion of personal protection equipment","shortage of ventilators","addiction","burnout","restructuring","anxiety","depression","overwhelming workload","fear","communication","previous epidemics","narrative review","significant change","understanding","new area","home infection","long run","surge","Authors","segment of infected individuals","testing","resilience","resources","deaths","insecure attachment","present article","range of causes","Methods","interventions","France","SARS-CoV","world","goal","Conclusions","H1N1","Objectives","face","consensus","need","Half","quarantine"],"language":"en"},

Some examples of the recent outbreaks are the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co) in the Middle East, and the Zika outbreak through the Americas. We have created a generic protocol for detection of pathogen RNA and/or DNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse dot-blot for detection (RDB) and processed automatically in a microfluidic device. In particular, we describe how a microfluidic assay to detect HIV viral RNA was converted to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA. We first optimized the RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV RNA using a benchtop isothermal amplification device. Then we implemented the assay in a microfluidic device that will allow analyzing 24 samples simultaneously and automatically from sample introduction to detection by RDB technique. Preliminary data using saliva samples spiked with ZIKV showed that our diagnostic system detects ZIKV RNA in saliva. These results will be validated in further experiments with well-characterized ZIKV human specimens of saliva. The described strategy and methodology to convert the HIV diagnostic assay and platform to a ZIKV RNA detection assay provides a model that can be readily utilized for detection of the next emerging or re-emerging infectious disease.","publish_time":"2018-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sabalza, Maite; Yasmin, Rubina; Barber, Cheryl A.; Castro, Talita; Malamud, Daniel; Kim, Beum Jun; Zhu, Hui; Montagna, Richard A.; Abrams, William R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8525c0b448a38d6453441a36426ce4c7a28c4e18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5798782.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29401479/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV RNA","RDB","ZIKV"],"locations":["Ebola","West Africa","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV RNA detection assay","detection of pathogen RNA","microfluidic assay","HIV viral RNA","HIV diagnostic assay","microfluidic device","RT-LAMP assay","saliva samples","well-characterized ZIKV human specimens of saliva","benchtop isothermal amplification device","recent outbreaks","numbers of infectious disease outbreaks","population vulnerabilities","population centers","diagnostic system","Zika outbreak","Zika virus","RDB technique","recent years","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","West Africa","environmental factors","global travel","platform","Ebola epidemic","experiments","MERS","ecological disasters","reverse dot-blot","sample introduction","methodology","DNA","loop","generic protocol","model","Preliminary data","floods","earthquakes","described strategy","Americas","examples","results"],"language":"en"},

In the case of rhabdoviruses, entry is facilitated exclusively by the envelope glycoprotein G and its interactions with the host cell. For vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), attachment to the cell surface was thought to be facilitated by interactions with the lipid phosphatidylserine, however recent work suggests that it is in fact initiated by recognition of proteinaeous receptors. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis delivers the virions into endosomes where they have been proposed to traffic to multi-vesicular bodies. There, the viral envelope fuses with internal vesicles in a process mediated by glycoprotein G in a pH- and phosphatidylserine-dependent manner. A clear mechanistic understanding of glycoprotein G mediated fusion has yet to be obtained, however current data suggests that it is likely facilitated by events distinct from Class I or Class II fusion proteins of other viruses. Rhabdoviruses are also notable in that their fusion protein exists in a reversible pH-dependent equilibrium, which prevents irreversible preactivation during assembly, and may prove to be relevant in the mediation of cell-to-cell fusion - an alternate form of viral spread.","publish_time":"2013-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regan, Andrew D.; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"Viral Entry into Host Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/155f2474c435ea2aa0226f22a70b569269788661.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7651-1_9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23884591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell fusion","envelope glycoprotein G","fusion proteins","mediation of cell","host cell","cell surface","clear mechanistic understanding of glycoprotein G mediated fusion","Class","interactions","Entry","viral envelope fuses","phosphatidylserine-dependent manner","vesicular stomatitis virus","Clathrin-mediated endocytosis","reversible pH-dependent equilibrium","lipid phosphatidylserine","case of rhabdoviruses","multi-vesicular bodies","alternate form of viral spread","internal vesicles","attachment","process","VSV","fact","step","irreversible preactivation","infectious life cycle","virions","recent work","recognition of proteinaeous receptors","traffic","endosomes","events distinct","assembly","current data"],"language":"en"},

The epidemic scale of COVID-19 has increased dramatically, with confirmed cases increasing across China and globally. Understanding the potential affecting factors involved in COVID-19 transmission will be of great significance in containing the spread of the epidemic. Environmental and meteorological factors might impact the occurrence of COVID-19, as these have been linked to various diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose causative pathogens belong to the same virus family as SARS-CoV-2. We collected daily data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air quality and meteorological variables of 33 locations in China for the outbreak period of 29 January 2020 to 15 February 2020. The association between air quality index (AQI) and confirmed cases was estimated through a Poisson regression model, and the effects of temperature and humidity on the AQI-confirmed cases association were analyzed. The results show that the effect of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was statistically significant in several cities. The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.0009, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RR = 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012) and day 3 (RR = 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012). The AQI effect on the confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10 \u00B0C \u2264 T \u003C 20 \u00B0C than in other temperature ranges, while the RR of COVID-19 transmission associated with AQI was higher in the relative humidity (RH) range of 10% \u2264 RH \u003C 20%.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, irreversible and debilitating lung disease showing fibroblast/myofibroblast expansion and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the interstitium leading to breathing difficulty. Our previous observation revealed a partial relief of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We hypothesize that Cordyceps has beneficial effects on lung fibrosis and the objective of this study is to explore the target(s) of Cordyceps in the relief of lung fibrosis in animal and cell models and to gain insight into its underlying mechanisms. Material and methods A rat model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis and a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction were employed in the studies. Results Reduction of infiltration of inflammatory cells, deposition of fibroblastic loci and collagen, formation of reactive oxygen species, and production of cytokines, as well as recovery from imbalance of MMP-9/TIMP-1, were observed in fibrotic rats after treatment with Cordyceps in preventive (from the day of BLM administration) and therapeutic (from 14 days after BLM) regimens. In a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction, the human lung epithelial A549 acquired a mesenchymal phenotype and an increase of vimentin expression with a concomitant decrease of E-cadherin. This epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition could be partially reverted by cordycepin, a major component of Cordyceps. Conclusion The findings provide an insight into the preventive and therapeutic potentials of Cordyceps for the treatment of lung fibrosis.","publish_time":"2012-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Mengli; Cheung, Florence W.K.; Chan, Ming Hung; Hui, Pak Kwan; Ip, Siu-Po; Ling, Yick Hin; Che, Chun-Tao; Liu, Wing Keung","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52652f9d6b5f22687d1e2e8ed42f02bae1562a78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125542.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874112004333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22796203/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.06.033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874112004333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cordyceps","BLM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of lung fibrosis","induced lung fibrosis","partial relief of lung fibrosis","debilitating lung disease","fibrotic cell model","human lung epithelial A549","therapeutic potentials of Cordyceps","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","major component of Cordyceps","transforming growth factor beta","induction","cell models","preventive","fibrotic rats","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Cordyceps sinensis","insight","treatment of fatigue","rat model of bleomycin","day of BLM administration","mesenchymal phenotype","mesenchymal transition","respiratory diseases","deposition of fibroblastic loci","excessive deposition of extracellular matrix","severe acute respiratory syndrome","patients","inflammatory cells","collagen","fungus","expansion","formation of reactive oxygen species","increase of vimentin expression","concomitant decrease of E","interstitium","animal","traditional Chinese medicine","Results Reduction of infiltration","beneficial effects","production of cytokines","SARS","methods","cordycepin","tonic","objective","previous observation","imbalance of MMP","recovery","cadherin","Material","findings","target","study","days","breathing difficulty","TIMP","underlying mechanisms","Conclusion","regimens","studies"],"language":"en"},

Like other coronaviruses, PDCoV commonly contains 4 major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Among these, the N protein is known to be the most abundant and multifunctional viral component. Therefore, as the first step toward understanding the biology of PDCoV, the present study investigated functional characteristics and expression dynamics of host proteins in a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the PDCoV N protein. Similar to N proteins of other coronaviruses, the PDCoV N protein was found to interact with itself to form non-covalently linked oligomers and was mainly localized to the nucleolus. We then assessed alterations in production levels of proteins in the N-expressing PK (PK-PDCoV-N) cells at different time points by means of proteomic analysis. According to the results of high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a total of 43 protein spots were initially found to be differentially expressed in PK-PDCoV-N cells in comparison with control PK cells. Of these spots, 10 protein spots showed a statistically significant alteration, including 8 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated protein spots and were picked for subsequent protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting following matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The affected cellular proteins that we identified in this study were classified into the functional groups involved in various cellular processes such as cell division, metabolism, the stress response, protein biosynthesis and transport, cytoskeleton networks and cell communication. Notably, two members of the heat shock protein 70 family were found to be up-regulated in PK-PDCoV-N cells. These proteomic data will provide insights into the specific cellular response to the N protein during PDCoV infection.","publish_time":"2015-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sunhee; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ade2824ccb1bdf7839a51ca3622c291e5663ac6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114568.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215002786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26103099/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.06.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215002786","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV N protein","N proteins","N cells","PK-PDCoV","regulated protein spots","protein biosynthesis","biology of PDCoV","PDCoV infection","subsequent protein identification","heat shock protein","control PK cells","affected cellular proteins","major structural proteins","production levels of proteins","expression dynamics of host proteins","cell division","cell communication","specific cellular response","coronaviruses","stable porcine cell line","various cellular processes","functional characteristics","stress response","ionization time","functional groups","present study","proteomic data","proteomic analysis","peptide mass fingerprinting","different time points","flight mass spectrometry","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","transport","matrix","enteritis","cytoskeleton networks","total","metabolism","comparison","laser desorption","results of high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","discovered enterotropic swine coronavirus","spike","insights","diarrhea","envelope","multifunctional viral component","membrane","alterations","members","family","significant alteration","nucleocapsid","linked oligomers","piglets","step","nucleolus"],"language":"en"},

The CVB3 genome is composed single-stranded RNA encoding polyproteins, which are cleaved to individual functional proteins by 2A and 3C proteases proteins which have been targeted for drug development. Here, we showed that protease activity required to activate a toxic protein may be used to prevent viral infection. METHODS: We modified the MazE-MazF antitoxin-toxin system of Escherichia coli to fuse a C-terminal fragment of MazE to the N-terminal end of toxin MazF with a linker having a specific protease cleavage site for CVB3. This fusion protein formed a stable dimer and was capable of inactivating the mRNA interferase activity of MazF which cleaves the ACA sequence in mRNA substrates. RESULTS: The incubation of 2A proteases with the fusion proteins induced cleavage between the MazE and MazF fragments from the fusion proteins; the subsequent release of MazF significantly inhibited virus replication. Additionally, we note that, CVB3 infected HeLa cells quickly died through a MazF toxin mediated effect before virus protein expression. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the MazEF fusion protein has a strong potential to be developed as an anti-virus therapy following CVB3 infection.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jung-Ho; Park, Jin-Ho; Choi, Wonho; Lim, Byung-Kwan","journal":"Mol Cell Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fff37ff9de7ac14189bacc386448ae96a624f19f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226459/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13273-019-0046-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion proteins","MazF fragments","CVB3 infection","MazEF fusion protein","CVB3 genome","MazF toxin mediated effect","mRNA interferase activity of MazF","subsequent release of MazF","virus protein expression","N-terminal end of toxin MazF","C proteases proteins","toxic protein","MazE-MazF antitoxin-toxin system of Escherichia coli","C-terminal fragment of MazE","CVB3 infected HeLa cells","protease activity","individual functional proteins","inhibited virus replication","anti-virus therapy","specific protease cleavage site","mRNA substrates","viral infection","linker","single-stranded RNA","ACA sequence","strong potential","polyproteins","member","findings","stable dimer","Coxsackievirus B3","polio-viruses","family Picornaviridae","BACKGROUNDS","Enterovirus genus","incubation","drug development","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Such information can be crucial to the improvement of communication efforts by public health officials and clinicians. The aim of this study was to identify awareness, attitudes, and practices related to influenza A (H1N1) among the Saudi public. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,548 adult subjects recruited from various shopping malls in Riyadh and Jeddah was conducted. All of the subjects were interviewed using a questionnaire that tested their knowledge, attitudes, and use of precautionary measures in relation to the H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: More than half (54.3%, 840/1548) of the participants showed high concern, 43.7%(677/1548) showed a low level of knowledge, and 60.8%(941/1548) had taken minimal or no precautionary measures. After adjusting for other variables, education level was the only significant predictor of the level of concern (p \u003C 0.001), while greater precautionary measures were taken by participants who were male (p \u003C 0.001), older (p = 0.047), better educated (p = 0.04), and more knowledgeable (p \u003C 0.001). More than one-third (38.3%) of participants were not convinced that the MOH reports about the disease were true, and only 16.1% of the participants reported receiving information from health providers. CONCLUSIONS: High concern did not translate into a higher compliance with precautionary recommendations, possibly due to the low level of knowledge about the disease among the public. Frequent communication between physicians and the public is recommended to help dispel myths about the disease and to spread better information about the role that the public can play in limiting the spread of the disease.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balkhy, Hanan H; Abolfotouh, Mostafa A; Al-Hathlool, Rawabi H; Al-Jumah, Mohammad A","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94cd1610fd21b8fc289d65a96973216217a955dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2844401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20187976/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-42","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["participants","level of concern","Saudi public","low level of knowledge","attitudes","public health officials","greater precautionary measures","education level","precautionary recommendations","better information","high concern","infectious disease outbreak","receiving information","spread","H1N1 influenza pandemic","health providers","adult subjects","Frequent communication","cross-sectional study","improvement of communication efforts","various shopping malls","significant predictor","relation","Riyadh","Jeddah","clinicians","practices","higher compliance","MOH reports","BACKGROUND","awareness","physicians","concerns","questionnaire","role","behavior","METHODS","variables","CONCLUSIONS","male","myths","RESULTS","half","aim"],"language":"en"},

Values Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Sponsors The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Recommendations 1. All hospitals should have infection control systems in place to ensure that alerts regarding changes in exposure risk factors for SARS or other potentially serious communicable diseases are conveyed promptly to clinical units, including the labour and delivery unit. (III-C) 2. At times of SARS outbreaks, all pregnant patients being assessed or admitted to the hospital should be screened for symptoms of and risk factors for SARS. (III-C) 3. Upon arrival in the labour triage unit, pregnant patients with suspected and probable SARS should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour. All labour and delivery units caring for suspected and probable SARS should have available at least one room in which patients can safely labour and deliver while in need of airborne isolation. (III-C) 4. If possible, labour and delivery (including operative delivery or Caesarean section) should be managed in a designated negative pressure isolation room, by designated personnel with specialized infection control preparation and protective gear. (III-C) 5. Either regional or general anaesthesia may be appropriate for delivery of patients with SARS. (III-C) 6. Neonates of mothers with SARS should be isolated in a designated unit until the infant has been well for 10 days, or until the mother\u2019s period of isolation is complete. The mother should not breastfeed during this period. (III-C) 7. A multidisciplinary team, consisting of obstetricians, nurses, pediatricians, infection control specialists, respiratory therapists, and anaesthesiologists, should be identified in each unit and be responsible for the unit organization and implementation of SARS management protocols. (III-C) 8. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should not care for other pregnant patients. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should be actively monitored for fever and other symptoms of SARS. Such individuals should not work in the presence of any SARS symptoms within 10 days of exposure to a SARS patient. (III-C) 9. All health care personnel, trainees, and support staff should be trained in infection control management and containment to prevent spread of the SARS virus. (III-A) 10. Regional health authorities in conjunction with hospital staff should consider designating specific facilities or health care units, including primary, secondary, or tertiary health care centres, to care for patients with SARS or similar illnesses.

The SARS peptide antibody system described presents an alternative tagging opportunity in the growing field of protein science.","publish_time":"2008-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gruschke, Steffi; Bu\u00DFmann, Bianca M.; Reiche, Sven; Jassoy, Christian","journal":"Protein Expression and Purification","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c2016ac62f20ec4641d28d924d94a4cdcafe091.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129034.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592808001186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18565762/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2008.04.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046592808001186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein purification","protein tags","protein detection","protein coding sequence","Abstract Protein tagging","p24 fusion protein","peptide tag","growing field of protein science","peptide-coding regions","SARS peptide antibody system","SARS-N","SARS-associated coronavirus nucleocapsid","efficient affinity purification","alternative tagging opportunity","single tag suites","Western blot","Gag","recognition of prokaryotically expressed HIV","monoclonal antibodies","short peptides","synthetic oligonucleotides","generation of tagged proteins","data","respect","used technique","Plasmids","usage","purposes"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study from January 1995 to December 2004 in which 14,068 stool samples from pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis were analyzed. The variables analyzed were sex, age, origin, diagnosis of rotavirus, and date of diagnosis. Differences were considered statistically significant if p \u003C 0.05. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 11.9 % of the samples (1687 cases) in the 10 years of the study, 12.14 % corresponded to boys and 11.81 % to girls (p = 0.5459). The mean age of the population was 2.63 years. The highest percentage of cases occurred in the group aged 1- 4 years old (14.1 %; p \u003C 0.001) and in outpatients (12.76 %; p \u003C 0.05). In this geographical region, there was a significant tendency (p \u003C 0.001) for rotavirus to occur in the winter months.

This study is a quantitative study that was conducted in January 2018. The results show that the majority of participants only wash their hands after using the toilet (87%) or handling vomitus or faecal matter (91%). The mean duration of handwashing was 36.54 seconds (SD = 18.57). The areas of the hand most neglected during handwashing were the fingertips (48.1%), medial area (30.5%), and back of the hand (28%). A multiple logistic regression shows that participants who have reached third-level education or higher often tend to be more hand hygienic than those who have not reached third-level education (p \u2264 0.001, B = 1.003).

Although outstanding efforts have led to the identification of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus receptors, the receptor for Deltacoronavirus is unclear. Here, we compared the amino acid sequences of several representative CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PDCoV spike (S) protein was close to the cluster containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which utilizes porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as a functional receptor. Ectopic expression of pAPN in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells rendered them susceptible to PDCoV. These results indicate that pAPN may be a functional receptor for PDCoV infection. However, treatment with APN-specific antibody and inhibitors did not completely block PDCoV infection in IPI-2I porcine intestinal epithelial cells. pAPN knockout in IPI-2I cells completely blocked TGEV infection but only slightly decreased PDCoV infection. Homologous modeling of pAPN with the S1 C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of PDCoV or TGEV showed that TGEV S1-CTD adopted \u03B2-turns (\u03B21\u2013\u03B22 and \u03B23\u2013\u03B24), forming the tip of a \u03B2-barrel, to recognize pAPN. However, only the top residues in the \u03B21\u2013\u03B22 turn of PDCoV S1-CTD had the possibility to support an interaction with pAPN, and the \u03B23\u2013\u03B24 turn failed to contact pAPN. We also discuss the evolution and variation of PDCoV S1-CTD based on structure information, providing clues to explain the usage of pAPN by PDCoV. Taken together, the results presented herein reveal that pAPN is likely not a critical functional receptor for PDCoV, although it is involved in PDCoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Xinyu; Liu, Shudan; Wang, Xunlei; Luo, Zhaochen; Shi, Yuejun; Wang, Dang; Peng, Guiqing; Chen, Huanchun; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0d0ceb2658c588ef2f3549f2b9a928b441d94a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5893578.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29636467/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0068-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDCoV spike","decreased PDCoV infection","variation of PDCoV S1-CTD","pAPN knockout","usage of pAPN","TGEV S1-CTD","Ectopic expression of pAPN","Homologous modeling of pAPN","blocked TGEV infection","Porcine deltacoronavirus","critical functional receptor","S1 C-terminal domain","IPI","\u03B21","\u03B22","porcine intestinal epithelial cells","\u03B24","\u03B23","results","member of genus Deltacoronavirus","porcine aminopeptidase N","\u03B2-barrel","non-susceptible BHK","cluster","emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus","protein","Betacoronavirus receptors","inhibitors","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","possibility","identification of Alphacoronavirus","structure information","amino acid sequences","representative CoVs","APN-specific antibody","clues","Phylogenetic analysis","treatment","tip","interaction","evolution","outstanding efforts","residues"],"language":"en"},

Concurrently and consequentially, the scientific perspective has changed from the reductionist approach of meticulously analyzing the fine details of a single component of biology, to the \u201Cholistic\u201D approach of broadmindedly examining the globally interacting elements of biological systems. The emergence of this new way of thinking has brought about a scientific revolution in which genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and other \u201Comics\u201D have become the predominant tools by which large amounts of data are amassed, analyzed and applied to complex questions of biology that were previously unsolvable. This enormous transformation of basic science research and the ensuing plethora of promising data, especially in the realm of human health and disease, have unfortunately not been followed by a parallel increase in the clinical application of this information. On the contrary, the number of new potential drugs in development has been steadily decreasing, suggesting the existence of roadblocks that prevent the translation of promising research into medically relevant therapeutic or diagnostic application. In this paper we will review, in a non-inclusive fashion, several recent scientific advancements in the field of translational research, with a specific focus on how they relate to infectious disease. We will also present a current picture of the limitations and challenges that exist for translational research, as well as ways that have been proposed by the National Institutes of Health to improve the state of this field.","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fontana, Judith M.; Alexander, Elizabeth; Salvatore, Mirella","journal":"Translational Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bf5a66852b114e39a9ce99f40fa1c336f290d03.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1e523f3a4ff9d861b18d3c1c19f8048e95da654b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3361696.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524411004580; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3361696?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524411004580; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2011.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22633095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institutes of Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of translational research","scientific revolution","scientific perspective","translation of promising research","recent scientific advancements","development","enormous transformation of basic science research","ensuing plethora of promising data","recent years","clinical application","diagnostic application","reductionist approach","infectious disease","new way of thinking","single component of biology","large amounts of data","realm of human health","complex questions of biology","National Institutes of Health","number of new potential drugs","refinement of high","fine details","proteomics","challenges","biomedical community","technological evolution","non-inclusive fashion","predominant tools","limitations","genomics","throughput methodologies","specific focus","current picture","metabolomics","parallel increase","emergence","state","existence of roadblocks","elements of biological systems","information","ways","paper"],"language":"en"},

Some of these antivirals can be isolated from a variety of sources, such as animals, plants, bacteria or fungi, while others must be obtained by chemical synthesis, either designed or random. Antivirals display a variety of mechanisms of action, and while some of them enhance the animal immune system, others block a specific enzyme or a particular step in the viral replication cycle. As viruses are mandatory intracellular parasites that use the host\u2019s cellular machinery to survive and multiply, it is essential that antivirals do not harm the host. In addition, viruses are continually developing new antiviral resistant strains, due to their high mutation rate, which makes it mandatory to continually search for, or develop, new antiviral compounds. This review describes natural and synthetic antivirals in chronological order, with an emphasis on natural compounds, even when their mechanisms of action are not completely understood, that could serve as the basis for future development of novel and/or complementary antiviral treatments.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Villa, T.

This may be attributed to a high risk of disease as veal calves are often purchased from numerous dairy herds, exposed to stress related to the transport and commingling of new animals, and fed a new ration. In this study, we used national register data to characterize the use of antimicrobials registered for large Danish veal calf and young bull producing herds in 2014. A total of 325 herds with veal calf and potentially young bull production were identified from the Danish Cattle database. According to the national Danish database on drugs for veterinary use (VetStat), a total of 537,399 Animal Daily Doses (ADD200) were registered for these 325 herds during 2014. The amount of antimicrobials registered in 2014 varied throughout the year, with the highest amounts registered in autumn and winter. Antimicrobials were registered for respiratory disorders (79%), joints/limbs/CNS disorders (17%), gastrointestinal disorders (3.7%) and other disorders (0.3%). Of the registered antimicrobials, 15% were for oral and 85% for parenteral administration. Long-acting formulations with a therapeutic effect of more than 48h covered 58% of the drugs for parenteral use. Standardized at the herd-level, as ADD200/100 calves/day, antimicrobial use distributed as median [CI95%] for starter herds (n=22): 2.14 [0.19;7.58], finisher herds (n=24): 0.48 [0.00;1.48], full-line herds (n=183): 0.78 [0.05;2.20] and herds with an inconsistent pattern of movements (n=96): 0.62 [0.00;2.24]. Full-line herds are herds, which purchase calves directly from a dairy herd and raise them to slaughter. Furthermore, we performed a risk factor analysis on the 183 herds with a full-line production. Here, we investigated, whether the number of suppliers, the number of calves purchased, the frequency of purchase, the average age at introduction, the average time in the herd and vaccination influenced the amount of antimicrobials used in the herds. The final multivariable regression analysis revealed that the number of calves introduced was positively associated with the antimicrobial use in the herd.","publish_time":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fertner, Mette; Toft, Nils; Martin, Henrik L\u00E6ss\u00F8e; Boklund, Anette","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b14e728770740bd96a18659cb80b2006d77ee250.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127564.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544250/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716301921; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587716301921; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.07.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["line herds","starter herds","finisher herds","registered antimicrobials","veal calves","use of antimicrobials","numerous dairy herds","number of calves","antimicrobial use","parenteral use","veterinary use","large Danish veal calf","line production","herd-level","CNS disorders","gastrointestinal disorders","respiratory disorders","national Danish database","young bull production","drugs","Danish Cattle database","total","ADD200","number of suppliers","Abstract High antimicrobial usage","high risk of disease","risk factor analysis","average age","average time","new animals","frequency of purchase","new ration","parenteral administration","national register data","final multivariable regression analysis","multidrug resistance","introduction","median","CI95","day","highest amounts","therapeutic effect","Animal Daily Doses","joints","stress","VetStat","inconsistent pattern of movements","vaccination","autumn","winter","acting formulations","transport","study","limbs","year","Europe"],"language":"en"},

Here we show that human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 and engineered LL-37 AMPs inhibit the infection of recombinant virus pseudotyped with EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the wild-type EBOV. These AMPs target EBOV infection at the endosomal cell-entry step by impairing cathepsin B-mediated processing of EBOV GP. Furthermore, two engineered AMPs containing D-amino acids are particularly potent in blocking EBOV infection in comparison with other AMPs, most likely owing to their resistance to intracellular enzymatic degradation.

For RNA viruses, cellular or virus-encoded RNA helicases play pivotal roles in viral life cycles by remodelling viral RNA structures and/or unwinding viral dsRNA produced during replication. However, no helicase or helicase-like activity has ever been found to associate with any NNSV-encoded proteins, and it is unknown whether the replication of NNSVs requires the participation of any viral or cellular helicase. Here, we show that despite of containing no conserved NTPase/helicase motifs, EBOV VP35 possesses the NTPase and helicase-like activities that can hydrolyse all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices in an NTP-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, guanidine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved compound and inhibitor of certain viral helicases, inhibited the NTPase and helicase-like activities of VP35 as well as the replication/transcription of an EBOV minigenome replicon in cells, highlighting the importance of VP35 helicase-like activity during EBOV life cycle. Together, our findings provide the first demonstration of the NTPase/helicase-like activity encoded by EBOV, and would foster our understanding of EBOV and NNSVs.","publish_time":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Ting; Gan, Tianyu; Bai, Peng; Wang, Xiaotong; Qian, Qi; Zhou, Hui; Cheng, Qi; Qiu, Yang; Yin, Lei; Zhong, Jin; Zhou, Xi","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84d3fe51518523e73a65e73756e4496587e4f2f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6582406.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular helicase","EBOV VP35","helicase motifs","importance of VP35 helicase","viral RNA structures","understanding of EBOV","virus-encoded RNA helicases","RNA helices","RNA viruses","viral dsRNA","EBOV life cycle","activity","viral life cycles","EBOV minigenome replicon","negative-sense RNA virus","conserved NTPase","activities of VP35","replication of NNSVs","inhibitor of certain viral helicases","Ebola virus","NNSV-encoded proteins","pivotal roles","FDA-approved compound","cells","participation","transcription","NTP-dependent manner","guanidine hydrochloride","types of NTPs","demonstration","family Filoviridae","lethal pathogens","planet","despite","findings"],"language":"en"},

Expression of mCherry and Luc are correlated with infection rate, allowing the monitoring of RSV multiplication in cell culture. Replication of the Luc-encoding virus in living mice can be visualized by bioluminescent imaging, bioluminescence being detected in the snout and lungs of infected mice after nasal inoculation. We propose that these recombinant viruses are convenient and valuable tools for screening of compounds active against RSV, and can be used as an extremely sensitive readout for studying effects of antiviral therapeutics in living mice.

Abstract The accumulation of a specific protein in aggregated form is a common phenomenon in human neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson\u0027s disease, this protein is \u03B1-synuclein which is a neuronal protein of 143 amino acids. With a monomeric conformation in solution, it also has a natural capacity to aggregate into amyloid structures (dimers, oligomers, fibrils and Lewy bodies or neurites). It therefore fulfils the characteristics of a prion protein (different conformations, seeding and spreading). In vitro and in vivo experimental evidence in transgenic and wild animals indicates a prion-like propagation of Parkinson\u0027s disease. The sequential and predictive distribution of \u03B1-synuclein demonstrated by Braak et al. and its correlation with non-motor signs are consistent with the prion-like progression. Although the triggering factor causing the misfolding and aggregation of the target protein is unknown, Parkinson\u0027s disease is a highly relevant model for the study of these mechanisms and also to test specific treatments targeting the assemblies of \u03B1-synuclein and propagation from pre-motor phase of the disease. Despite this prion-like progression, there is currently no argument indicating a risk of human transmission of Parkinson\u0027s disease.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brandel, J.-P.; Corbill\u00E9, A.-G.; Derkinderen, P.; Ha\u00EFk, S.","journal":"Revue Neurologique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/086a2184465a37990314e4b90d113690382308c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111738.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0035378715008760; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035378715008760","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Braak"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the disease","with the prion","prion protein","prot\u00E9ine prion","progression prion","In Parkinson\u0027s disease","the study","The sequential","like progression","Parkinson\u0027s disease is","this protein is \u03B1","the target protein is unknown","like propagation","maladie de Parkinson","Abstract The accumulation","specific protein in aggregated form is","Despite this prion","Although the triggering factor causing the misfolding","monomeric conformation in solution","synuclein which is","neuronal protein","experimental evidence in transgenic","It therefore fulfils the characteristics","nombreux arguments exp\u00E9rimentaux in","prot\u00E9ine sp\u00E9cifique","prot\u00E9ine neuronale","also to test specific treatments targeting the assemblies","common phenomenon in human neurodegenerative diseases","there is currently no argument indicating","it also","synuclein demonstrated","human transmission","motor phase","synucl\u00E9ine mise","Braak","agr\u00E9gation de la prot\u00E9ine cible reste inconnu","propagation from pre","its correlation with","motor signs","structures amylo\u00EFdes","diff\u00E9rentes conformations","different conformations","phase pr\u00E9","Lewy bodies or neurites","conformation monom\u00E9rique","risque de transmission interhumaine","natural capacity to aggregate into amyloid structures","aggregation","risk","wild animals indicates","oligomers","dimers","these mechanisms","fibrils","initiation","ph\u00E9nom\u00E8ne commun","fibrilles","oligom\u00E8res","forme agr\u00E9g\u00E9e","predictive distribution","faveur","highly","diss\u00E9mination","dim\u00E8res","corps","assemblages d","seeding","\u00E9vidence","maladies neurod\u00E9g\u00E9n\u00E9ratives humaines","traitements sp\u00E9cifiques","animaux transg\u00E9niques","mod\u00E8le","amino acids","origine du mauvais repliement","m\u00E9canismes","\u00E9tude","processus transconformationnel","spreading","capacit\u00E9 naturelle","acides amin\u00E9s","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","caract\u00E9ristiques","sens","diffusion s\u00E9quentielle","corr\u00E9lation","signes","moteurs","facteur"],"language":"fr"},

Gilbert and colleagues use two indicators to determine the capacity of countries to detect and respond to cases: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Based on their analysis, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa had the highest importation risk, and a moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had moderate risk with variable capacity and high vulnerability.

These treatments are referable before the vaccine and specific drugs are available for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Lei; Li, Ranran; Wu, Zhixiong; Yang, Xianghong; Zhao, Mingyan; Liu, Jiao; Chen, Dechang","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea53df1f877e6497b4516621fe0f0eda90129961.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167303.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00661-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Wuhan, Hubei Province","ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ICU","intensive management","treatment of COVID","novel coronavirus disease","circulation management","promising drugs","specific drugs","appropriate nutritional strategies","respiratory supportive strategies","intensive care unit","multiple organ function monitoring","ill patients","adjunctive agents","vaccine","outbreak","Hubei Province","viral infections","China","Wuhan","previous experience","substantial medical resource","nCoV","clinical threat","general population","influenza","end","treatments","people","present article"],"language":"en"},

There are two kinds of influenza vaccines available in the United States: an inactivated vaccine (TIV) and an attenuated vaccine; however, only TIV is approved for immunization of the elderly population. While the aged population has the highest rate of influenza vaccination, the protective efficacy is low as evidenced by elderly individuals having the highest mortality associated with influenza. Recently, we reported that an adjuvant derived from the helminth parasite Onchocerca volvulus, named O. volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1), can significantly enhance the protective efficacy of an inactivated vaccine (TIV) in young adult mice. In the current study, we examined whether this recombinant Ov-ASP-1 (rOv-ASP-1) can enhance the efficacy of TIV in aged mice as well. While primary immunization with TIV alone produced only a low level of influenza-specific antibodies (total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c) in aged mice, the antibody levels were significantly increased after immunization with TIV\u002BrOv-ASP-1. More importantly, the level of the total IgG in aged mice administered TIV\u002BrOv-ASP-1 was comparable to that of young adult mice immunized with TIV alone. Co-administration of rOv-ASP-1 induced a low level of crossreactive antibody and enhanced the protective efficacy of TIV in aged mice, reflected by significantly increased survival after challenge with a heterologous influenza virus. rOv-ASP-1 was also superior to the conventional adjuvant alum in inducing specific IgG after TIV immunization in aged mice, and in conferring protection after challenge. These results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 may serve as a potential adjuvant for influenza vaccine to improve the efficacy of protection in the elderly.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Jiu; Fisher, Erin M.; Concannon, Mark; Lustigman, Sara; Shen, Hao; Murasko, Donna M.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c620b0fd9f2134b3393f63cd52f08f22d6247e6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9e4e243fca179d7b5585c5ad6e5c3be35df164bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4731280.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.01.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16000220; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4731280?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16000220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26795365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TIV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["TIV immunization","rOv-ASP","aged mice","protective efficacy of TIV","low level of influenza","pandemics of influenza","aged population","young adult mice","recombinant Ov-ASP","efficacy of protection","inactivated vaccine","heterologous influenza virus","primary immunization","highest rate of influenza vaccination","Co-administration of rOv","specific IgG","total IgG","attenuated vaccine","kinds of influenza vaccines available","elderly population","low level of crossreactive antibody","challenge","potential adjuvant","elderly individuals","conventional adjuvant alum","specific antibodies","volvulus activation","highest mortality","antibody levels","conferring protection","increased survival","helminth parasite Onchocerca volvulus","United States","IgG1","seasonal epidemics","IgG2c","best way","secreted protein","results","current study"],"language":"en"},

Measles virus is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus and a member of the Morbillivirus genus in the family of Paramyxoviridae. Although RNA viruses have high mutation rates, measles virus is an antigenically monotypic virus and the surface proteins responsible for inducing protective immunity have retained their antigenic structure. The public health significance is that measles vaccines developed decades ago from a single measles virus strain remain protective worldwide. Prior to the development and widespread use of measles vaccine, 30 million cases of measles were estimated to occur each year, resulting in more than 1 million deaths. Several live, attenuated measles vaccines are available, either as single-antigen vaccines or in combination with rubella and mumps vaccines (MR and MMR vaccines). Most of the currently used measles vaccines were derived from the Edmonston strain of measles virus that was isolated by Enders and Peebles in 1954. Measles vaccines are recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. Despite progress in reducing measles mortality, measles remains a major cause of vaccine-preventable death and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia. The ideal measles vaccine would be inexpensive, safe, heat-stable, immunogenic in neonates or very young infants, and administered as a single dose without needle or syringe. A number of vaccine candidates with some of these characteristics are undergoing preclinical studies, including DNA vaccines and various viral and bacterial vectored vaccines. The high infectivity of measles virus is a characteristic suitable to a biothreat agent. However, increasingly high levels of measles vaccination coverage throughout the world as part of accelerated measles control efforts would protect many from the deliberate use of measles virus as a biothreat agent. Genetic engineering of a measles virus strain that was not neutralized by antibodies induced by the current attenuated measles vaccines would likely have reduced infectivity, as suggested by the fact that wild-type measles viruses have not mutated to alter their neutralizing epitopes. Measles virus meets many of the biological criteria for disease eradication. Measles virus has no nonhuman reservoir, can be accurately diagnosed, and measles vaccination is a highly effective intervention. Where measles virus differs from smallpox and polio viruses is that it is more highly infectious, necessitating higher levels of population immunity to interrupt transmission. It remains unclear whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication, but provision of a second opportunity for measles vaccination likely could be stopped following eradication.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moss, William J.; Griffin, Diane E.; Feinstone, W.

Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host.

Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA to rescue viable virus.

It integrated a suction-type, pneumatic-driven microfluidic control module, a magnetic bead-based fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) and an end-point optical detection module. This new system can successfully distinguish between influenza A and B using a single chip test within 15 min automatically, which is faster than existing devices.

We identified 11 RNA viruses, 4 DNA viruses, 4 species of bacteria, and 1 fungus. While most are known to cause ARIs, others, such as echovirus 6, are rarely associated with respiratory disease. Co-infection of viruses and bacteria and of multiple viruses were commonplace (9/48), with one patient harboring 5 different pathogens, and genome sequence data revealed large intra-species diversity. Expressed resistance against eight classes of antibiotic was detected, with those for MLS, Bla, Tet, Phe at relatively high abundance. In summary, we used a simple total RNA sequencing approach to reveal the complex polymicrobial infectome in ARI.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical differences between KD with adenovirus infection and only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers for prediction of adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection. METHODS: A total of 147 patients with isolated adenovirus were identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 11 patients having KD with adenovirus, who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy during the acute phase of KD were also evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the adenoviral infection group, the KD with adenovirus group was significantly associated with frequent lip and tongue changes, skin rash and changes in the extremities. In the laboratory parameters, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level and presence of hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria were significantly associated with the KD group. In the multivariate analysis, lip and tongue changes (odds ratio [OR], 1.416; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.151\u20131.741; P=0.001), high CRP level (OR, 1.039; 95% CI 1.743\u20131.454; P= 0.021) and sterile pyuria (OR 1.052; 95% CI 0.861\u20131.286; P=0.041) were the significant predictive factors of KD. In addition, the cutoff CRP level related to KD with adenoviral detection was 56 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9%. CONCLUSION: Lip and tongue changes, higher serum CRP level and sterile pyuria were significantly correlated with adenovirus-positive KD.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jong Han; Kang, Hye Ree; Kim, Su Yeong; Ban, Ji-Eun","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11ebffa99e4b093c6304549246b534983012f909.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5854841.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2018.61.2.43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KD group","KD patients","adenovirus-positive KD","adenovirus group","isolated adenovirus","acute phase of KD","prediction of adenovirus","adenoviral infection group","isolated adenoviral infection","tongue changes","significant predictive factors of KD","cutoff CRP level","high CRP level","sterile pyuria","higher serum CRP level","Human adenovirus infection mimics Kawasaki disease","adenoviral detection","frequent lip","addition","higher C-reactive protein","skin rash","presence of hypoalbuminemia","PURPOSE","clinical differences","biomarkers","intravenous immunoglobulin therapy","laboratory parameters","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","total","multivariate analysis","odds ratio","study","extremities","CONCLUSION","confidence interval","METHODS","RESULTS","sensitivity","specificity","aim"],"language":"en"},

Lesions affecting the neurological, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive systems are most often observed. The control of ND must include strict biosecurity that prevents virulent NDV from contacting poultry, and also proper administration of efficacious vaccines. When administered correctly to healthy birds, ND vaccines formulated with NDV of low virulence or viral-vectored vaccines that express the NDV fusion protein are able to prevent clinical disease and mortality in chickens upon infection with virulent NDV. Live and inactivated vaccines have been widely used since the 1950\u2019s. Recombinant and antigenically matched vaccines have been adopted recently in some countries, and many other vaccine approaches have been only evaluated experimentally. Despite decades of research and development towards formulation of an optimal ND vaccine, improvements are still needed. Impediments to prevent outbreaks include uneven vaccine application when using mass administration techniques in larger commercial settings, the difficulties associated with vaccinating free-roaming, multi-age birds of village flocks, and difficulties maintaining the cold chain to preserve the thermo-labile antigens in the vaccines. Incomplete or improper immunization often results in the disease and death of poultry after infection with virulent NDV. Another cause of decreased vaccine efficacy is the existence of antibodies (including maternal) in birds, which can neutralize the vaccine and thereby reduce the effectiveness of ND vaccines. In this review, a historical perspective, summary of the current situation for ND and NDV strains, and a review of traditional and experimental ND vaccines are presented.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dimitrov, Kiril M.; Afonso, Claudio L.; Yu, Qingzhong; Miller, Patti J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f1f7b2859429c26a3e8e0ce1356b1b5184afc96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131810.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28024856/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516308045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516308045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","ND","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulent NDV","experimental ND vaccines","effectiveness of ND vaccines","NDV strains","inactivated vaccines","matched vaccines","optimal ND vaccine","control of ND","viral-vectored vaccines","infection of poultry","NDV of low virulence","NDV fusion protein","proper administration of efficacious vaccines","vaccine approaches","virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus","clinical disease","uneven vaccine application","Abstract Newcastle disease","difficulties","contacting poultry","death of poultry","healthy birds","cause of decreased vaccine efficacy","multi-age birds of village flocks","review of traditional","mass administration techniques","larger commercial settings","current situation","vaccinating free-roaming","summary","formulation","mortality","chickens","Animal Health","strict biosecurity","cold chain","development","existence of antibodies","thermo-labile antigens","historical perspective","World Organisation","outbreaks","reproductive systems","decades of research","improper immunization","Impediments","improvements","Lesions","countries","Recombinant"],"language":"en"},

While many studies portray mechanisms in early antiviral immune responses of humans and mice, much remains to be discovered about these mechanisms in the cat. With the objective of shedding light on early host\u2013virus interactions in felids, we have developed 12 real-time TaqMan\u00AE qPCR systems for feline genes relevant to innate responses to viral infection, including those encoding for various IFN\u03B1 and IFN\u03C9 subtypes, IFN\u03B2, intracellular antiviral factor Mx, NK cell stimulator IL-15 and effectors perforin and granzyme B, as well as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 8. Using these newly developed assays and others previously described, we measured the relative expression of selected markers at early time points after viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Feline embryonic fibroblasts (FEA) inoculated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) indicated peak levels of IFN\u03B1, IFN\u03B2 and Mx expression already 6h after infection. In contrast, Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CrFK) cells inoculated with feline herpes virus (FHV) responded to infection with high levels of IFN\u03B1 and IFN\u03B2 only after 24h, and no induction of Mx could be detected. In feline PBMCs challenged in vitro with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), maximal expression levels of IFN\u03B1, \u03B2 and \u03C9 subtype genes as well as IL-15 and TLRs 3, 7 and 8 were measured between 12 and 24h after infection, whereas expression levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene IL-6 were consistently downregulated until 48h post inoculation. A marginal upregulation of granzyme B was also observed within 3h after infection. In an in vivo experiment, cats challenged with FIV exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in IFN\u03B1 expression in blood 1 week post infection. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility of stimulating feline immune cells in vitro with various immune response modifiers (IRMs) already known for their immunostimulatory properties in mice and humans, namely Poly IC, Resiquimod (R-848) and dSLIM\u2122, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing several unmethylated CpG motifs. Stimulation of feline PBMCs with dSLIM\u2122 and R-848 effectively enhanced expression of IFN\u03B1 within 12h by factors of 6 and 12, respectively, and Poly IC induced an increase in Mx mRNA expression of 28-fold. Altogether, we describe new molecular tools and their successful use for the characterization of innate immune responses against viruses in the cat and provide evidence that feline cells can be stimulated by synthetic molecules to enhance their antiviral defence mechanisms.","publish_time":"2011-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robert-Tissot, C\u00E9line; R\u00FCegger, Vera L.; Cattori, Valentino; Meli, Marina L.; Riond, Barbara; Gomes-Keller, Maria Alice; V\u00F6gtlin, Andrea; Wittig, Burghardt; Juhls, Christiane; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aab6c0aff00b4f09700c7ddad734cb3994e2970a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112645.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21719112/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242711002029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242711002029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","FIV","Poly IC, Resiquimod","CpG","Poly IC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN\u03B1 expression","feline cells","feline immune cells","Mx expression","feline immunodeficiency virus","feline leukemia virus","feline herpes virus","enhanced expression of IFN\u03B1","maximal expression levels of IFN\u03B1","viral infection","feline genes relevant","Stimulation of feline PBMCs","various IFN\u03B1","Mx mRNA expression","Feline embryonic fibroblasts","peak levels of IFN\u03B1","high levels of IFN\u03B1","week post infection","Crandell-Rees feline kidney","early antiviral immune responses of humans","IFN\u03B2","characterization of innate immune responses","innate immune system","h post inoculation","expression levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene IL","antiviral defence mechanisms","early host","virus interactions","relative expression of selected markers","induction of Mx","intracellular antiviral factor Mx","various immune response modifiers","host defence","viruses","FIV","mice","fold increase","Poly IC","dSLIM","TLRs","early time points","NK cell stimulator IL","synthetic oligonucleotide","synthetic molecules","marginal upregulation of granzyme B","developed assays","\u03C9 subtype genes","central role","CrFK","blood","successful use","IFN\u03C9 subtypes","qPCR systems","FEA","FeLV","effectors perforin","IRMs","real-time TaqMan","objective of shedding light","felids","FHV","new molecular tools","unmethylated CpG motifs","contrast","Toll","Resiquimod","evidence","studies","immunostimulatory properties","possibility","receptors","experiment","cats","factors"],"language":"en"},

Many of the nuclear proteins that localise to these domains are involved in RNA processing, and because of their limited coding capacity, it may be necessary for RNA viruses to sequester such cellular factors in order to facilitate the replication, transcription and translation of their genomes. Amongst the best-studied examples of this are the picornaviruses, whose infection results in the redistribution of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm and their interaction with the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to facilitate translation of the picornavirus polyprotein. Examples can be found of other positive and also negative strand RNA virus proteins that localise to the nucleus and sub-domains (especially the nucleolus) during virus infection, and several localisation motifs have been defined. Apart from sequestering nuclear proteins for a role in replication, such viruses may also target the nucleus to disrupt nuclear functions and to inhibit antiviral responses.","publish_time":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hiscox, Julian A.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60a281761c385cd49696d15a36326c1ef74f5ed2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125749.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170203001606; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170203001606","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleus","redistribution of nuclear proteins","nuclear functions","nuclear components","negative strand RNA virus proteins","negative strand RNA viruses","RNA processing","primary site of replication","number of positive","virus infection","cytoplasm","order","number of different sub-domains","translation","nucleolus","examples","infection results","internal ribosome entry site","interaction","replicative processes","IRES","structures","cellular factors","host cell function","transcription","role","limited coding capacity","picornaviruses","localisation motifs","antiviral responses","picornavirus polyprotein","genomes","best"],"language":"en"},

The enzymes present in MDBK, MDCK, VERO, BHK, and chick embryo cells required lysinearginine or arginine-arginine pairs as cleavage sites, whereas chorioallantoic membrane cells contained, in addition, an activity that could cleave at a single arginine. The effect of peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones on the activation of the fowl plague virus hemagglutinin by the proteases specific for paired basic residues has been investigated. When virions containing uncleaved hemagglutinin were incubated with lysates of uninfected cells, cleavage was completely inhibited by peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones containing paired basic residues at a concentration of 1 mM. In contrast a compound containing a single arginine had no inhibitory activity.

Herd prevalence was found to be 91.7% (11/12 herds) for Giardia and 58.3% (7/12 herds) for Cryptosporidium. Regarding the age of the animals, although Giardia was detected in animals as young as 1 week, the prevalence increased with age, reaching 80% by 8 weeks. Similarly, the highest percentage of Cryptosporidium detection (20%) was also found in the 8 week-old group. By PCR, 92 of the 274 analysed samples were positive for Giardia. Sequencing of the amplicons showed the existence of Giardia duodenalis assemblage A in 67 samples; G. duodenalis assemblage E in 24 samples; and inconsistent results between the two molecular markers used in a further sample. Cryptosporidium was only detected by PCR in 3 of the 274 samples; Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in two samples and Cryptosporidium ubiquitum in one sample. This study is the first performing molecular characterisation of both parasites in Peruvian alpacas, and the first report of C. ubiquitum in this host. The identification of G. duodenalis assemblage A, C. parvum and C. ubiquitum, suggests that zoonotic transmission of these enteropathogens between alpacas and humans is possible.","publish_time":"2012-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez-Couso, Hip\u00F3lito; Ortega-Mora, Luis M.; Aguado-Mart\u00EDnez, Adriana; Rosadio-Alc\u00E1ntara, Ra\u00FAl; Maturrano-Hern\u00E1ndez, Lenin; Luna-Espinoza, Luis; Zanabria-Huisa, V\u00EDctor; Pedraza-D\u00EDaz, Susana","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/065b4479aa47cf07a1955ffd52ec2985a2a16a02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125553.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401712000441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341616/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.01.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401712000441","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Peru"],"keyphrases":["Cryptosporidium ubiquitum","analysed samples","Cryptosporidium parvum","faecal samples of alpacas","presence of Giardia","existence of Giardia duodenalis assemblage","herds","highest percentage of Cryptosporidium detection","duodenalis assemblage E","Peruvian alpacas","PCR amplification","animals","ssu-rRNA gene","molecular characterisation","sequencing of fragments","molecular markers","Herd prevalence","immunofluorescence microscopy","Vicugna pacos","\u03B2-giardin genes","inconsistent results","parasites","report of","amplicons","total","zoonotic transmission","co-infection","pathogens","study","humans","host","identification of","week-old group","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Many different serotypes of IB virus (IBV) are recognized which cause different clinical manifestations. According to the antigenic differences, different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect. Massachusetts serotype induces the best cross-protection against other serotypes. Recently, the IBV QX strain has been detected in Iran. QX strain causes permanent damage to the oviduct if it occurs in the early life cycle and is a significant factor in layer and breeder chicken flocks. In this study, we compare the H120 and Ma5 vaccines\u2019 protection against early challenge with the QX strain in commercial chicks. one-day-old commercial chicks were divided into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 were unvaccinated groups. Groups 3 and 5 were vaccinated with the H120 vaccine (eye drop) and groups 4 and 6 were vaccinated with Ma5 (eye drop) on the 6th day (5 days after vaccination). Groups 2, 3 and 4 challenged (oculonasal) with QX strain (10^(4) EID50). Ciliostasis test, histopathology, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR were done at 11 days-old of age. Results showed that neither H120 nor Ma5 could induce proper cross-protection against QX early challenge, but the viral load and adverse pathological records in vaccinated chicks were less than that in the non-vaccinated groups. It can be concluded that vaccination on the first day of the life of a chick offers not full protection against the IBV QX strain but reduced the viral load and pathological damages in vaccinated chickens. Applying other forms of vaccination and using different genotypes on one-day-old chicks are suggested.","publish_time":"2017-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karimi, Vahid; Ghalyanchilangeroudi, Arash; Hashemzadeh, Masoud; Rahimi, Forough; Zabihi Petroudi, Mohammad Taha; Farahani, Reza KH; Maghsoudloo, Hossein; Abdollahi, Hamed","journal":"VirusDisease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36e6ca0fa6951e03a41cf489e71e109b39d51f9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5877842.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13337-017-0414-4; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13337-017-0414-4.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29607371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB"],"locations":["Massachusetts","Iran"],"keyphrases":["vaccinated chicks","IBV QX strain","non-vaccinated groups","day-old chicks","unvaccinated groups","QX early challenge","day-old commercial chicks","kidney of chicks","vaccinated chickens","different serotypes of IB virus","proper cross-protection","best cross-protection","Ma5 vaccines\u2019 protection","different genotypes","days-old","viral load","early life cycle","H120 vaccine","eye drop","different clinical manifestations","forms of vaccination","pathological damages","Infectious bronchitis","adverse pathological records","infectious avian pathogen","significant factor","reproductive system","respiratory tract","histopathology","layer","gut","quantitative real-time RT-PCR","breeder chicken flocks","oviduct","permanent damage","Ciliostasis test","Massachusetts serotype","antigenic differences","oculonasal","Results","Iran","study","EID50"],"language":"en"},

This paper systematically reviews the scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The purpose of this review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant scientific knowledge, published through March 2018, and to identify information gaps and research needs, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to policy makers, the swine industry, and the scientific community. A total of 26 documents were selected for the final review process, which included experimental studies, case reports, epidemiological investigations, and scientific opinion, among others. The review found that the scientific literature has addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, but the current body of scientific knowledge lacks conclusive evidence of virus contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial swine feed, particularly for imported commodities, and further investigation into the epidemiology of virus transmission via feed to swine under field conditions through natural feeding behavior is warranted. Additional studies of how imported ingredients of commercial swine feed are sourced, processed, transported and, thus, contaminated prior to importation into the United States are needed. Moving forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and subsequent virus mitigation steps in processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, Rebecca K.; Kotowski, Ingrid K.; Coulson, Kari F.; Link, Donald; MacKenzie, Alexandra; Bowling-Heyward, Joyce","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/461e14fcd69e84dfcc444f0ab92632688997b40d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6714588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508430/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00273","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States","North America"],"keyphrases":["imported ingredients of commercial swine feed","swine industry","non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed","transmission of swine viruses","viral pathogens of swine","conclusive evidence of virus contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial swine feed","transmission of viral swine pathogens","scientific literature","introduction of African swine fever","scientific opinion","scientific community","possible role of contaminated feed","relevant scientific knowledge","experimental studies","current body of scientific knowledge","epidemiology of virus transmission","Additional studies","United States","final review process","subsequent virus mitigation steps","available evidence","post-processing","imported commodities","research needs","critical experimental questions","fruitful focus of research","PED","epidemiological investigations","field conditions","ASF","policy makers","potential","growing concerns","North America","case reports","spotlight","China","emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea","natural feeding behavior","European Union","affected regions","likely source","information gaps","documents","importation","paper","total","purpose"],"language":"en"},

However, different products may have diverse immunomodulation. The experiment was conducted to examine effects of mannan oligosaccharide (Actigen; ACT) on growth performance and serum concentrations of antibodies and inflammatory mediators in weanling pigs (Sus scrofa) experimentally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). A total of 32 PRRSV-negative pigs (3 wk old) were randomly assigned from within blocks to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement [2 types of diet: control (0%) and ACT addition (0.04%); and with and without PRRSV] in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were blocked by initial BW within sex. Ancestry was equalized across treatments. Pigs (8/treatment) were kept individually in each pen. After 2 wk of an 8-wk period of feeding the treatments, pigs received an intranasal inoculation of PRRSV or sham medium at 5 wk of age. Infection by PRRSV decreased ADG, ADFI, and G:F throughout the experiment (P \u003C 0.01). Actigen did not affect ADG (P = 0.450), but decreased (P = 0.047) ADFI from 28 to 42 days postinoculation (DPI). During that time, ACT improved G:F in infected pigs but not in sham controls (interaction, P = 0.009). Dietary ACT did not affect viremia in infected pigs (P \u003E 0.05), but increased PRRSV-specific antibody titer at 35 DPI (P = 0.042). Infection with PRRSV induced the febrile responses of pigs from 3 to 10 DPI (P \u003C 0.001) with return to normal at 14 DPI. During the experimental period, the rectal temperature of pigs was found slightly elevated by ACT (P = 0.045). Infected pigs had greater serum concentrations of IL-1\u03B2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-\u03B3, IL-10, and haptoglobin (Hp) than sham controls (P \u003C 0.001). These results indicate that PRRSV stimulated secretion of cytokines involved in innate, T-helper 1, and T-regulatory immune responses. Actigen tended to decrease the serum TNF-\u03B1 concentration regardless of PRRSV (P = 0.058). The ACT \u00D7 PRRSV interaction was significant for IL-1\u03B2 (P = 0.016), IL-12 (P = 0.026), and Hp (P = 0.047), suggesting that infected pigs fed ACT had greater serum concentrations of these mediators than those fed the control. The increases in IL-1\u03B2 and IL-12 may favorably promote innate and T-cell immune functions in infected pigs fed ACT. Feeding ACT may be useful as ACT is related to increased PRRSV antibody titers and G:F in infected pigs at certain times during infection.","publish_time":"2012-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Che, T.

Method Sixty-four sputum samples collected from 46 adult patients were included in the study: 33 samples were collected during exacerbation of CF, and 31 during the stable phase. After extraction, nucleic acids were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses. When rhinovirus (HRV) was detected, the 5\u2032UTR and VP4/2 regions were sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. The characteristics of patients in exacerbation and stable phase were compared. Results Viruses were found in 25% of samples. The HRV viruses were the most frequently detected followed by coronaviruses. Only the HRV detection was significantly associated with the occurrence of CF pulmonary exacerbation (p \u003C0.027). Characterization of 5\u2032UTR and VP4/2 regions of the HRV genome specified that HRV-A, -B, -C were detected. All HRV-C were recombinant HRV-Ca. Conclusions HRV were the most frequently detected viruses; their detection was significantly associated with the occurrence of an exacerbation. The reality of viral recombination between HRV was demonstrated in CF patients for the first time, raising the role of viruses in lung microbiota.

Currently, complete virions have been used as antigens in SeV serological tests. However, the complexity of SeV virion antigen limits the accuracy of the diagnostic method. In the current study, complete SeV virion antigen was separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed, with nucleocapsid protein (NP) showing predominant antigenicity. A peptide array containing overlapping 14-mer peptides covering the entire NP was developed. The array used SeV positive serum and resulted in four antigenic linear peptides being identified, which were located in the carboxyl-terminus of NP. The four peptides were coated on ELISA plates and tested with SeV positive and SeV negative sera, and the antigenicity of three peptides, NP413\u2013428, NP473\u2013490 and NP507\u2013524, was confirmed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy). Multi-modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed and Embase databases. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (36 men, 22 women; age range, 18\u201398 years) were included in the study. Among these, chest US, CXR, and CT were performed respectively in twenty-two, thirty-two and forty-two patients. Lung US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (100%) and subpleural consolidations (27.3%). CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (46.9%) and hazy increased opacities (37.5%). Typical CT features included bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) with (59.5%) and without (35.7%) consolidations having a predominantly peripheral distribution (64.3%). Other imaging features included crazy paving pattern (57.1%), fibrous stripes (50%), subpleural lines (35.7%), architectural distortion (28.6%), air bronchogram sign (26.2%), vascular thickening (23.8%) and nodules (2.4%). Also, enlarged lymph nodes (14.3 %) and pleural effusion (7.1%) were observed. The literature review identified twenty-six original studies supporting our imaging chest findings. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission includes B-lines and consolidations on US, consolidations and hazy increased opacities on CXR, and multifocal GGO with consolidations on CT.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lomoro, Pascal; Verde, Francesco; Zerboni, Filippo; Simonetti, Igino; Borghi, Claudia; Fachinetti, Camilla; Natalizi, Anna; Martegani, Alberto","journal":"Eur J Radiol Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7da17b672b395b7eff0ad56cd504b3e49dfe474f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eb529a1a7818cf9c556c1460ce3bb45cc5aaf963.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129441.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352047720300204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289051/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352047720300204; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","CXR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chest US","CXR","imaging chest findings","subpleural consolidations","prevalent manifestations of consolidations","spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID","imaging features of emerging COVID","Lung US findings","chest ultrasound","B-lines","Multi-modality imaging findings","subpleural lines","Typical CT features","hazy increased opacities","pneumonia","comprehensive radiological literature review","diffuse B lines","admission","Literature research","consecutive patients","multilobar ground-glass opacities","multifocal GGO","ongoing radiological data","retrospective single-center study","radiographs","original studies","methodical search","computed tomography","recent publications","crazy paving pattern","Valduce Hospital","age range","Pubmed","Embase databases","women","examinations","SARS-CoV","Como","Italy","METHODS","years","CONCLUSION","air bronchogram sign","enlarged lymph nodes","vascular thickening","laboratory","MATERIALS","fibrous stripes","architectural distortion","RESULTS","peripheral distribution","PURPOSE","pleural effusion","nodules"],"language":"en"},

It also recommends a preferred order for future rural electricity investment: Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Liaoning and Xinjiang, i.e. from the most to the least developed provinces, if the investment objectives are to find the best market return and the greatest impact on rural market development.","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Ming; Yu, Xin","journal":"Energy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1758122645fe23b60639235c9400e99485739e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134604.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2003.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544203002846; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360544203002846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288040/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["rural electricity market","rural market development","rural economic development","future rural electricity investment","electricity consumption","developed provinces","annual electricity demand","capital investment","investment objectives","community infrastructure development","Chinese provinces","paper","best market return","different economic backgrounds","sectorial energy demand analysis","agriculture sector","output values","population","Hebei","Jiangsu","greatest impact","township","Henan","income","forecasting model","Shaanxi","years","households","county level","preferred order","village enterprises","Liaoning","TVEs","Xinjiang","Historical data"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 has had its heaviest toll on Europe, United States and China. As of 1 (st) of April 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa was relatively low, with the highest number registered by South Africa, which had reported 1,380 confirmed cases. On the same date (also the date of this review), Africa had reported 5,999 confirmed cases, of which 3,838 (almost 65%) occurred in South Africa, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, with the remaining 2,071 cases distributed unevenly across the other African countries. We speculate that while African nations are currently experiencing much lower rates of COVID-19 relative to other continents, their significantly lower testing rates may grossly underestimate incidence rates. Failure to grasp the true picture may mean crucial windows of opportunity shut unutilized, while limited resources are not deployed to maximum effect. In the absence of extensive testing data, an overestimation of spread may lead to disproportionate measures being taken, causing avoidable strain on livelihoods and economies. Here, based on the African situation, we discuss COVID-19 diagnostic challenges and how they may blunt responses.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kobia, Francis; Gitaka, Jesse","journal":"AAS Open Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec14057ac4d2904c8723151bfd4f1d3e75eae493.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205356.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399515/; https://doi.org/10.12688/aasopenres.13061.1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Europe","United States","South Africa","Algeria","Africa"],"keyphrases":["lower rates of COVID","number of confirmed COVID","confirmed cases","South Africa","African countries","lower testing rates","incidence rates","China","African nations","date","African situation","highest number","overestimation of spread","novel Coronavirus disease","absence of extensive testing data","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","crucial windows of opportunity","Europe","United States","Tunisia","Morocco","Algeria","Egypt","continents","avoidable strain","limited resources","true picture","heaviest toll","disproportionate measures","SARS-CoV","livelihoods","economies","deaths","maximum effect","diagnostic challenges","pandemic status","Failure","territories","emergence","Wuhan","review","people","responses"],"language":"en"},

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) or PCR was employed to screen for both hMPV and other common respiratory viruses in 2613 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections from September 2007 to February 2011 (a period of 3.5 years). The demographics and clinical presentations of patients infected with different genotypes of hMPV were compared. A total of 135 samples were positive for hMPV (positive detection rate: 5.2%). Co\u2010infection with other viruses was observed in 45.9% (62/135) of cases, and human bocavirus was the most common additional respiratory virus. The most common symptoms included cough, fever, and wheezing. The M gene was sequenced for 135 isolates; of these, genotype A was identified in 72.6% (98/135) of patients, and genotype B was identified in 27.4% (37/135) of patients. The predominant genotype of hMPV changed over the 3.5\u2010year study period from genotype A2b to A2b or B1 and then to predominantly B1.

These results suggested that hMPV is an important viral pathogen in pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Changsha.

In the last 60 years (1950\u20132010) there had been 124,255 reported human rabies cases, an average of 2,037 cases per year. However, the factors and mechanisms behind the persistence and prevalence of human rabies have not become well understood. The monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health exhibits a periodic pattern on an annual base. The cases in the summer and autumn are significantly higher than in the spring and winter. Based on this observation, we propose a susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIRS) model with periodic transmission rates to investigate the seasonal rabies epidemics. We evaluate the basic reproduction number R (0), analyze the dynamical behavior of the model, and use the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health. We also carry out some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R (0) in terms of various model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is more reasonable to regard R (0) rather than the average basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] or the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the corresponding autonomous system as a threshold for the disease. Finally, our studies show that human rabies in China can be controlled by reducing the birth rate of dogs, increasing the immunization rate of dogs, enhancing public education and awareness about rabies, and strengthening supervision of pupils and children in the summer and autumn.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Juan; Jin, Zhen; Sun, Gui-Quan; Sun, Xiang-Dong; Ruan, Shigui","journal":"Bull Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91096eede9d3809948df0fa851951341b12998c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22383117/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-012-9720-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Chinese Ministry of Health"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of human rabies","monthly data of human rabies cases","basic reproduction number R","average basic reproduction number","seasonal rabies epidemics","Chinese Ministry of Health","text","Formula","China","summer","autumn","major public-health problem","terms of various model parameters","immunization rate of dogs","birth rate of dogs","public education","periodic pattern","nervous system","periodic transmission rates","corresponding autonomous system","SEIRS","awareness","persistence","sensitivity analysis","threshold","children","supervision of pupils","infection","mechanisms","annual base","studies","spring","winter","factors","disease","dynamical behavior","observation","years"],"language":"en"},

Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People\u2019s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bwire, George M.; Paulo, Linda S.","journal":"Trop Med Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7061485.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32165854/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00201-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Republic"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic COVID","returning travelers","days quarantine of travelers","body temperature screening","possible importation of COVID","asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID","high risk areas","RT-PCR","fever","countries","symptoms-based screening","Coronavirus disease","major test","reliable test","travel restrictions","World Health Organization","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","Wuhan","People\u2019s Republic of China","Hubei Province","approach","recent report","points of entry","number of cases","airports","hand","identification","limited resources","note","epidemiological map"],"language":"en"},

Outbreaks of HFMD peaks in the warmer season of the year, but the underlying factors for this annual pattern and the reasons to the recent upsurge trend have not yet been established. This study analyzed the effect of short-term changes in weather on the incidence of HFMD in Singapore. METHODS: The relative risks between weekly HFMD cases and temperature and rainfall were estimated for the period 2001\u20132008 using time series Poisson regression models allowing for over-dispersion. Smoothing was used to allow non-linear relationship between weather and weekly HFMD cases, and to adjust for seasonality and long-term time trend. Additionally, autocorrelation was controlled and weather was allowed to have a lagged effect on HFMD incidence up to 2 weeks. RESULTS: Weekly temperature and rainfall showed statistically significant association with HFMD incidence at time lag of 1\u20132 weeks. Every 1\u00B0C increases in maximum temperature above 32\u00B0C elevated the risk of HFMD incidence by 36% (95% CI = 1.341\u20131.389). Simultaneously, one mm increase of weekly cumulative rainfall below 75 mm increased the risk of HFMD by 0.3% (CI = 1.002\u20131.003). While above 75 mm the effect was opposite and each mm increases of rainfall decreased the incidence by 0.5% (CI = 0.995\u20130.996). We also found that a difference between minimum and maximum temperature greater than 7\u00B0C elevated the risk of HFMD by 41% (CI = 1.388\u20131.439). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a strong association between HFMD and weather. However, the exact reason for the association is yet to be studied. Information on maximum temperature above 32\u00B0C and moderate rainfall precede HFMD incidence could help to control and curb the up-surging trend of HFMD.","publish_time":"2011-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hii, Yien Ling; Rockl\u00F6v, Joacim; Ng, Nawi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf1b9188ca2e3eb5e80b73dcf3c12799344a7199.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3037951.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347303/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016796","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD","HFMD in Singapore"],"locations":["Asia Pacific Region"],"keyphrases":["incidence of HFMD","risk of HFMD incidence","weekly HFMD cases","surging trend of HFMD","Outbreaks of HFMD peaks","Weekly temperature","weather","increases of rainfall","maximum temperature greater","moderate rainfall","C increases","increase of weekly cumulative rainfall","long-term time trend","significant association","time lag","strong association","lagged effect","weeks","effect of short-term changes","recent upsurge trend","time series Poisson regression models","relative risks","non-linear relationship","reasons","foot","mouth disease","annual pattern","over-dispersion","warmer season","underlying factors","year","Hand","difference","seasonality","findings","fatal complications","study","METHODS","period","RESULTS","Asia Pacific Region","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Smoothing","exact reason","Information","Singapore","autocorrelation"],"language":"en"},

Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that TfR1 is an additional receptor for TGEV and assists TGEV invasion and replication.

Clinical and histopathologic characteristics are similar across severely affected patients, suggesting that a common mode of immune reaction may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of ARDS. There may be etiologic substances that have an affinity for respiratory cells and induce lung cell injury in cases of ARDS. These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis). The severity or chronicity of ARDS depends on the amount of etiologic substances with corresponding immune reactions, the duration of the appearance of specific immune cells, or the repertoire of specific immune cells that control the substances. Therefore, treatment with early systemic immune modulators (corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin) as soon as possible may reduce aberrant immune responses in the potential stage of ARDS.","publish_time":"2017-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Kyung-Yil","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ed6b522481e264a5d691f7f5fbd5d142b5f82f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5343923.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18020388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28208675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["etiologic substances","immune proteins","non-protein substances","repertoire of specific immune cells","appearance of specific immune cells","respiratory cells","aberrant immune responses","corresponding immune reactions","cases of ARDS","chronicity of ARDS","immunopathogenesis of ARDS","early systemic immune modulators","common mode of immune reaction","potential stage of ARDS","injured host cells","biochemical characteristics","various pathogens","protein-homeostasis","histopathologic characteristics","various sizes","biochemical properties","pathogenic proteins","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","lung cell injury","corticosteroids","duration","affected patients","affinity","intravenous immunoglobulin","pneumonia","treatment","peptides","infectious insults","molecular level","system hypothesis","theory","noninfectious events","severity"],"language":"en"},

KSHV achieves this by tethering its epigenome to the host chromosome by latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which binds in the terminal repeat (TR) region of the viral genome. Sequence analysis of the TR, a GC-rich DNA element, identified several potential Quadruplex G-Rich Sequences (QGRS). Since quadruplexes have the tendency to obstruct DNA replication, we used G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds to examine their effect on latent DNA replication and the persistence of viral episomes. Our results showed that these G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds led to the activation of dormant origins of DNA replication, with preferential bi-directional pausing of replications forks moving out of the TR region, implicating the role of the G-rich TR in the perturbation of episomal DNA replication. Over time, treatment with PhenDC3 showed a loss of viral episomes in the infected cells. Overall, these data show that G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds retard the progression of replication forks leading to a reduction in DNA replication and episomal maintenance. These results suggest a potential role for G-quadruplex stabilizers in the treatment of KSHV-associated diseases.","publish_time":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madireddy, Advaitha; Purushothaman, Pravinkumar; Loosbroock, Christopher P.; Robertson, Erle S.; Schildkraut, Carl L.; Verma, Subhash C.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed52c50fb3ff01140790f21c6e9716a8cd3c9fa8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4856979.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26837574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KSHV","Quadruplex G-Rich Sequences"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["latent DNA replication","G-rich TR","G-quadruplex stabilizers","perturbation of episomal DNA replication","potential Quadruplex G-Rich Sequences","activation of dormant origins of DNA replication","progression of replication forks","TR region","compounds","GC-rich DNA element","treatment of KSHV","infected cells","viral genome","potential role","loss of viral episomes","persistence of viral episomes","dividing cells","results","associated diseases","latent infection","episomal maintenance","preferential bi-directional pausing of replications forks","latency","reduction","nuclear antigen","host chromosome","extra-chromosomal episome","PhenDC3","effect","herpesvirus","epigenome","life","QGRS","LANA","Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma","terminal repeat","tendency","Sequence analysis","time","quadruplexes","data"],"language":"en"},

Genome-wide analyses and recombination have rarely been conducted, as small numbers of samples and limited genomic characterization have previously prevented further analyses. Herein, we report a unique CRCoV strain, denoted strain BJ232, derived from a CRCoV-positive dog with a mild respiratory infection. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome of all available coronaviruses consistently show that CRCoV BJ232 is most closely related to human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and BCoV, forming a separate clade that split off early from other Betacoronavirus 1. Based on the phylogenetic and SimPlot analysis we propose that CRCoV-K37 was derived from genetic recombination between CRCoV-BJ232 and BCoV. In detail, spike (S) gene of CRCoV-K37 clustered with CRCoV-BJ232. However orf1ab, membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes were more related to Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) than CRCoV-B232. Molecular epidemic analysis confirmed the prevalence of CRCoV-BJ232 lineage around the world for a long time. Recombinant events among Betacoronavirus 1 may have implications for CRCoV transmissibility. All these findings provide further information regarding the origin of CRCoV.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Shuai; Wang, Yanqun; Chen, Yingzhu; Wu, Bingjie; Qin, Kun; Zhao, Jincun; Lou, Yongliang; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/613190af3c40eb22e479079068b6d7aed237faad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114567.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28506792/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217302332; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217302332","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["CRCoV BJ232","CRCoV-BJ232","CRCoV-K37","prevalence of CRCoV","gene of CRCoV","origin of CRCoV","CRCoV transmissibility","CRCoV-B232","unique CRCoV strain","CRCoV-positive dog","complete genome sequence of CRCoV","denoted strain BJ232","BJ232 lineage","BCoV","Phylogenetic analysis","canine respiratory coronavirus","South Korea strain K37","Bovine coronavirus","human coronavirus OC43","Genome-wide analyses","SimPlot analysis","Betacoronavirus","important respiratory pathogen","mild respiratory infection","Molecular epidemic analysis","HCoV-OC43","genetic recombination","limited genomic characterization","genes","countries","world","small numbers of samples","available coronaviruses","implications","nucleocapsid","information","spike","long time","Recombinant events","membrane","findings","separate clade","orf1ab","date"],"language":"en"},

During the outbreak, many hospitals instructed the health profession\u0027s schools to restrict or prevent the presence of their students and interns in their hospitals in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Objectives Constraining the presence of interns in the affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation. In this paper, we present the experience of four faculty preceptors in restructuring the advanced pharmacy practice experience in different clinical settings, including critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, and internal medicine, in order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a large academic medical institution in Saudi Arabia.

Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections. However, there are several drugs for influenza, a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, and some new antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV and hepatitis C infections. The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Protease inhibitors (darunavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir), viral DNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and tenofovir), and an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) are included in the list of Top 200 Drugs by sales for the 2010s.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vardanyan, Ruben; Hruby, Victor","journal":"Synthesis of Best-Seller Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a2855d957080dc48cf423370fc2816492ecce2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149618.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124114920000341; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124114920000341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protease inhibitors","integrase inhibitors","uncoating inhibitors","entry inhibitors","attachment inhibitors","new antiviral drugs","effective antiviral drugs","couple of drugs","viral DNA polymerase inhibitors","nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors","nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors","viral infections","Antiviral drug creation strategies","hepatitis C infections","treatment of HIV","Abstract Viruses","major pathogenic agents","valacyclovir","ritonavir","variety of serious diseases","humans","atazanavir","herpesviruses","animals","tenofovir","valganciclovir","darunavir","different approaches","Direct virus","host cell factors","raltegravir","list","influenza","arsenal of antivirals","plants","half","FDA","sales"],"language":"en"},

Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in limiting mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation in the central nervous system and protecting dopaminergic neurons and a promising therapeutic target for PD. Cicadidae Periostracum (CP), the cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius, has been used in traditional medicine for its many clinical pharmacological effects, including the treatment of psychological symptoms in PD. However, scientific evidence for the use of CP in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is lacking. Here, we investigated the protective effects of CP on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced PD in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on Nurr1. CP increased the expression levels of Nurr1, tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in differentiated PC12 cells and the mouse SNPC. In MPTP-induced PD, CP promoted recovery from movement impairments. CP prevented dopamine depletion and protected against dopaminergic neuronal degradation via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 by inhibiting MPTP-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and glial/microglial activation. Moreover, CP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines and response levels and glial/microglial activation in BV2 microglia and the mouse brain. Our findings suggest that CP might contribute to neuroprotective signaling by regulating neurotrophic factors primarily via Nurr1 signaling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.","publish_time":"2019-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Hye-Sun; Kim, Joong-Sun; Moon, Byeong Cheol; Choi, Goya; Ryu, Seung Mok; Lee, Jun; Ang, Mary Jasmin; Jeon, Mijin; Moon, Changjong; Park, Gunhyuk","journal":"Oxid Med Cell Longev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd6dd93085fa736cac9569090a8cb88324daf18f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6854990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772707/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5797512","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Parkinson","Cicadidae Periostracum"],"organizations":["CP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of CP","protective effects of CP","MPTP-induced PD","CP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines","MPTP-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines","expression levels of Nurr1","dopamine transporter","dopaminergic neurons","dopaminergic neuronal loss","dopaminergic neuronal degradation","microglial activation","mouse SNPC","Nuclear receptor","Bcl","mitochondria-mediated apoptosis","nuclear hormone receptor","response levels","dopamine depletion","cleaved caspase","mouse brain","vesicular monoamine transporter","clinical pharmacological effects","extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation","tyrosine hydroxylase","differentiated PC12 cells","inducible nitric oxide synthase","substantia nigra pars compacta","DOPA decarboxylase","promising therapeutic target","apoptotic proteins","cyclooxygenase","BV2 microglia","mitochondrial dysfunction","Cicadidae Periostracum","central nervous system","cytochrome c","neuroinflammation","cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius","recovery","B-cell lymphoma","associated X","scientific evidence","treatment of psychological symptoms","traditional medicine","mice","neurodegenerative diseases","underlying mechanisms of action","neurotrophic factors","movement impairments","methyl","phenyl","striatum","tetrahydropyridine","Parkinson\u0027s disease","findings"],"language":"en"},

Emerging data indicate that phase II antioxidant enzyme pathways could play a role in virus-associated inflammation and immune clearance. While Nrf2-dependent gene expression is known to modify inflammation, a mechanistic role in viral susceptibility and clearance has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we utilized differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (NEC) and an enzymatic virus-like particle entry assay, to examine the role Nrf2-dependent gene expression has on viral entry and replication. Herein, lentiviral vectors that express Nrf2-specific short hairpin (sh)-RNA effectively decreased both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in transduced human NEC from healthy volunteers. Nrf2 knockdown correlated with a significant increase in influenza virus entry and replication. Conversely, supplementation with the potent Nrf2 activators sulforaphane (SFN) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly decreased viral entry and replication. The suppressive effects of EGCG on viral replication were abolished in cells with knocked down Nrf2 expression, suggesting a causal relationship between EGCG-induced activation of Nrf2 and ability to protect against viral infection. Interestingly, the induction of Nrf2 via nutritional supplements SFN and EGCG, increased antiviral mediators/responses; RIG-I, IFN-\u03B2, and MxA at baseline in the absence of infection. Our data indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the levels of Nrf2 expression, and viral entry/replication. We also demonstrate that supplementation with Nrf2-activating antioxidants inhibit viral replication in human NEC, which may prove to be an attractive therapeutic intervention. Taken together, these data indicate potential mechanisms by which Nrf2-dependent gene expression regulates susceptibility to influenza in human epithelial cells.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kesic, Matthew J.; Simmons, Steven O.; Bauer, Rebecca; Jaspers, Ilona","journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c558619bfa8e83b1ab3f7782cbe23f4b0c0b78f3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/82878484a60d40541185eb37f590885d32466f11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3135631.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549835/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584911002541; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3135631?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584911002541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Nrf2 mRNA","induction of Nrf2","Nrf2 knockdown","Nrf2 protein expression","levels of Nrf2 expression","viral replication","viral entry","role Nrf2-dependent gene expression","viral infection","EGCG-induced activation of Nrf2","viral susceptibility","potent Nrf2 activators sulforaphane","influenza virus entry","express Nrf2-specific short hairpin","human epithelial cells","Influenza infection","transduced human NEC","particle entry assay","differentiated human nasal epithelial cells","enzymatic virus","mechanistic role","virus-associated inflammation","suppressive effects of EGCG","supplementation","Emerging data","absence of infection","causal relationship","inverse relationship","immune clearance","nutritional supplements SFN","significant increase","antioxidants","antiviral mediators","antioxidant enzyme pathways","mortality","RIG","phase","responses","epigallocatechin gallate","ability","major cause of morbidity","lentiviral vectors","healthy volunteers","potential mechanisms","MxA","IFN-\u03B2","baseline","attractive therapeutic intervention","pandemics outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

AIM: To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. RESULTS: Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia.

Interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a type I interferon induced ubiquitin-like modifier. In addition to conjugating to potentially hundreds of target proteins, ISG15 can be found in an unconjugated form both inside of the cell and released from interferon stimulated cells into the extracellular environment. Due to its robust expression after type I interferon stimulation and the broad panel of proteins that it targets, ISG15 has drawn much attention as a potential regulator of the immune response and has been shown to mediate protection in a number of different viral infection models.

METHODS: We obtained the following data at admission: sex, age, neonatal history, past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses, heart rate, respiratory rate, the presence of fever, total duration of fever, oxygen saturation, laboratory parameters (i.e., complete blood cell count, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], etc.), and chest radiography. RESULTS: The study comprised 279 young children. Of these, 26 had a chest radiograph revealing opacity (n=24) or atelectasis (n=2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment for confounding factors, the clinical predictors associated with pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with bronchiolitis were elevated hs-CRP level (\u003E0.3 mg/dL) and past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (all P\u003C0.05).

Using a novel approach, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) systems efficiently and rapidly rescued another recombinant virus with a 224-amino-acid deletion in the N-terminal domain of the TGEV Spike gene (S_NTD224), which is analogous to the N-terminal domain of porcine respiratory coronavirus. S_NTD224 notably affected the TGEV growth kinetics in PK-15 cells but was not essential for recombinant virus survival. In animal experiments with 13 two-day-old piglets, the TGEV recombinant viruses with/without S_NTD224 deletion induced obvious clinical signs and mortality. Together, our results directly demonstrated that S_NTD224 of TGEV mildly influenced TGEV virulence but was not the enteric tropism determinant and provide new insights for the development of a new attenuated vaccine against TGEV.

Here, we have targeted the 3C protease of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), a feco\u2010orally transmitted virus of the family Picornaviridae, for identification of potential antivirals. The 3C protease is a viable drug target as it is required by HAV, as well as by other picornaviruses, for post\u2010translational proteolysis of viral polyproteins and for inhibiting host innate immune pathways. Computational screening, followed by chemical synthesis and experimental validation resulted in identification of a few compounds which, at low micromolar concentrations, could inhibit HAV 3C activity. These compounds were further tested experimentally against the 3C protease of Human Rhinovirus, another member of the Picornaviridae family, with comparable results.

Most viroporins are monovalent selective cation channels, with few showing the ability to conduct divalent cations, like calcium (Ca(2\u002B)). Nevertheless, some viroporins are known to disrupt host cell Ca(2\u002B) homeostasis, which is critical for virus replication and pathogenesis. Rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane glycoprotein that has a viroporin domain (VPD), and NSP4 viroporin activity elevates cytosolic Ca(2\u002B) in mammalian cells. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that the NSP4 VPD forms an ion channel and determine whether the channel can conduct Ca(2\u002B). Using planar lipid bilayer and liposome patch clamp electrophysiology, we show that a synthetic peptide of the NSP4 VPD has ion channel activity. The NSP4 VPD was selective for cations over anions and channel activity was observed to have both well-defined \u201Csquare top\u201D openings as well as fast current fluctuations, similar to other viroporins. Importantly, the NSP4 VPD showed similar conductance of divalent cations (Ca(2\u002B) and Ba(2\u002B)) as monovalent cations (K(\u002B)), but a viroporin defective mutant lacked Ca(2\u002B) conductivity. These data demonstrate that the NSP4 VPD is a Ca(2\u002B)-conducting viroporin and establish the mechanism by which NSP4 disturbs host cell Ca(2\u002B) homeostasis.","publish_time":"2017-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pham, Thieng; Perry, Jacob L.; Dosey, Timothy L.; Delcour, Anne H.; Hyser, Joseph M.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a81f08700b297b78c8f255c4a428f2675ca45ef9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5335360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28256607/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43487","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NSP4 VPD","NSP4 viroporin activity","cytosolic Ca","host cell Ca","Viroporins","ion channel activity","monovalent cations","viroporin domain","similar conductance of divalent cations","small virus-encoded ion channel proteins","viroporin defective mutant","homeostasis","virus replication","monovalent selective cation channels","liposome patch clamp electrophysiology","planar lipid bilayer","openings","endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane glycoprotein","anions","fast current fluctuations","synthetic peptide","mechanism","pathogenesis","Rotavirus nonstructural protein","ability","calcium","study","data","mammalian cells","goal","Ba","conductivity"],"language":"en"},

Molecular methods were used to investigate the genetic relatedness and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of a collection of 203 non-repetitive XDR-PA isolates available for study. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 52 genotypes were observed; one predominant genotype (pulsotype 1) was found in 57.6% of the isolates. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses demonstrated that one horizontally acquired mechanism [metallo-\u03B2-lactamase (MBL) genes] and two mutational mechanisms (efflux and porins) accounted for the carbapenem resistance. The most predominant horizontally acquired mechanism was carriage of bla(VIM-3), which was found in 61.1% of isolates. Decreased expression of oprD was the most prevalent mutational mechanism and was found in 70.0% of the XDR-PA isolates, whereas overexpression of mexA was found in 27.6% of the isolates. The highlight of this study was the discovery of statistically significant relationships between certain horizontally acquired and mutational resistance mechanisms and their contribution to carbapenem susceptibility. MBL-producers expressed significantly lower MexAB and higher OprD than non-MBL-producers. Amongst isolates without an acquired \u03B2-lactamase gene, oprD expression was significantly reduced, whilst expression of efflux pumps was increased. Reduced OprD expression alone or the production of VIM-type MBLs showed similar contributions to a low to intermediate MIC(50) (minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms) for carbapenems. Isolates with reduced OprD expression that simultaneously harboured bla(VIM) exhibited high levels of resistance to carbapenems, which implied that these two mechanisms had a synergistic effect on the MICs.","publish_time":"2011-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Jwu-Ching; Chia, Ju-Hsin; Siu, Leung-Kei; Kuo, An-Jing; Huang, Shu-Huan; Su, Lin-Hui; Wu, Tsu-Lan","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53a6b0500d2b30192fa3f0bf91d16ac8c1bec5d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125715.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.09.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857911004079; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857911004079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIC"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["Reduced OprD expression","mutational resistance mechanisms","Decreased expression of oprD","carbapenem resistance mechanisms","mutational mechanisms","higher OprD","non-repetitive XDR-PA isolates available","expression of efflux pumps","non-MBL-producers","prevalent mutational mechanism","acquired \u03B2-lactamase gene","production of VIM","high levels of resistance","study","carbapenem susceptibility","carbapenems","harboured bla","metallo-\u03B2","carriage of bla","predominant genotype","quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses","sequencing","similar contributions","lower MexAB","collection","type MBLs","drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa","PFGE","intermediate MIC","discovery","genes","porins","pulsed-field gel electrophoresis","genetic relatedness","genotypes","significant relationships","Polymerase chain reaction","minimum inhibitory concentration","overexpression of mexA","prevalence","synergistic effect","MICs","organisms","pulsotype","highlight","northern Taiwan","Molecular methods"],"language":"en"},

With the advent of the droplet-spread disease severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a review of the infection control procedures for aerosols is warranted. Types of Studies Reviewed The authors reviewed representative medical and dental literature for studies and reports that documented the spread of disease through an airborne route. They also reviewed the dental literature for representative studies of contamination from various dental procedures and methods of reducing airborne contamination from those procedures. Results The airborne spread of measles, tuberculosis and SARS is well-documented in the medical literature. The dental literature shows that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria and blood.

However, it is not known how robust these rate estimates are to inaccuracies in the data, particularly in sampling dates that are used for molecular clock calibration. Here we report on the rate of evolution of the emerging pathogen Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which has significantly different rates of evolution for the same outer capsid (VP60) gene published in the literature. In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting data and further elucidate details of RHDV \u2019s evolutionary history, we undertook fresh Bayesian analyses and employed jackknife control methods to produce robust substitution rate and time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates for RHDV based on the VP60 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. RESULTS: Through these control methods, we were able to identify a single misdated taxon, a passaged lab strain used for vaccine production, which was responsible for depressing the RHDV capsid gene\u2019s rate of evolution by 65%. Without this isolate, the polymerase and the capsid protein genes had nearly identical rates of evolution: 1.90x10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year, ns/s/y, (95% highest probability density (HPD) 1.25x10(-3)-2.55x10(-3)) and 1.91x10(-3) ns/s/y (95% HPD 1.50x10(-3)-2.34x10(-3)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After excluding the misdated taxon, both genes support a significantly higher substitution rate as well as a relatively recent emergence of RHDV, and obviate the need for previously hypothesized decades of unobserved diversification of the virus. The control methods show that using even one misdated taxon in a large dataset can significantly skew estimates of evolutionary parameters and suggest that it is better practice to use smaller datasets composed of taxa with unequivocal isolation dates. These jackknife controls would be useful for future tip-calibrated rate analyses that include taxa with ambiguous dates of isolation.","publish_time":"2012-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hicks, Allison L; Duffy, Siobain","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce0df4a52a142b05d4967e8ff626b87f2e435d9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3426481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22646287/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-12-74","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","RHDV","HPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rate estimates","RHDV capsid gene\u2019s rate of evolution","robust substitution rate","higher substitution rate","details of RHDV","identical rates of evolution","recent emergence of RHDV","different rates of evolution","jackknife control methods","phylogenetic estimates of nucleotide substitution rates","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes","capsid protein genes","estimates of evolutionary parameters","single misdated taxon","future tip-calibrated rate analyses","taxa","outer capsid","VP60","s evolutionary history","RNA viruses","unequivocal isolation dates","ambiguous dates of isolation","HPD","sampling dates","literature","nucleotide substitutions","jackknife controls","conflicting data","fresh Bayesian analyses","recent common ancestor","emerging pathogen Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus","passaged lab strain","year","time","smaller datasets","vaccine production","site","TMRCA","hypothesized decades of unobserved diversification","evolving species","large dataset","highest probability density","need","90x10","inaccuracies","better practice","molecular clock calibration","25x10","attempt","BACKGROUND","isolate","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","50x10","91x10","55x10","34x10"],"language":"en"},

Infection with more than one pathogen has been reported in RTI; however, the association of the pathogen spectrum in upper and lower respiratory tract infections remains unclear. Methods A prospective study was conducted during February to October 2016. Fifty-five nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and 30 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 55 hospitalized children aged less than 14years (mean age 40months) and diagnosed with an RTI were collected. All samples were detected for 18 respiratory pathogens using the Filmarray assay, real-time PCR, or nested PCR methods. Detection results and clinical characteristics of all cases were analyzed using chi-square and t tests. Results Forty-one of 55 (74.5%) NPS obtained from children were positive for at least one pathogen by the Filmarray assay. Of these cases, 53.7% (22/41) were co-infected. The most commonly detected pathogen was rhinovirus (RV), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Infection by both RV and MP was the most frequently observed pattern of co-infection. Similar results were observed using real-time PCR. The pathogens in the NPS from 76.6% of cases detected by Filmarray and 80.0% of cases by real-time PCR included all the pathogens detected in the BALF sample from the same individual. The Filmarray assay showed an 80% concordance rate with real-time PCR and had a turnaround time of less than 1.2h. No significant differences were observed between the association of single-infection and co-infection with clinical characteristics, neither by Filmarray nor real-time PCR. Conclusion The spectrum of pathogens is mostly concordant in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Collecting NPS for detection can be a non-invasive and more convenient option compared with BALF. Although co-infection is common in children with an RTI, the clinical significance of co-infection remains unclear and warrants further analysis.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yongping; Liang, Weiwen; Miao, Danyun; Chen, Dingqiang; Wu, Shangzhi; Ye, Zhiying; Liu, Zhongmin; Chen, Dehui","journal":"Frontiers in Laboratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542364917300183; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542364917300183","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPS","BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time PCR","respiratory pathogens","clinical significance of co-infection","observed pattern of co-infection","RTI","Filmarray assay","NPS","cases","detected pathogen","Abstract Background Respiratory tract infection","spectrum of pathogens","pathogen spectrum","nested PCR methods","lower respiratory tract infections","clinical characteristics","hospitalized children","Detection results","respiratory syncytial virus","samples","BALF sample","Similar results","association of single","common disease","ages","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","years","high hospitalization","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","concordance rate","months","mortality rates","mean age","convenient option","chi-square","RSV","turnaround time","rhinovirus","t tests","nasopharyngeal swabs","prospective study","significant differences","individual","Conclusion","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Chuan-bin; Wang, Yue-ye; Liu, Geng-hao; Liu, Zhe","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12d40547629907f8d399d7381d2ab7027eab8a2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193031.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["nCoV infection","SARS-CoV infection","mechanisms of human CoV infection","respiratory tract infection","preferred organ of human CoV infection","infection control procedures","MERS-CoV","infectious human CoVs","morphology of human CoVs","eye","respiratory viruses","upper respiratory tract","CoV RNA positive rate","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","ophthalmic practice","ophthalmic manifestations","novel coronavirus","patients","ocular surface","role","preferred gateway of entry","hospital-related viral transmission","nasolacrimal duct","entry receptors","nasopharyngeal mucosa","extraocular pathogens","useful information","lacrimal duct system","health care workers","worldwide health threat","strict hand hygiene","RT-PCR test","fomites","droplets","constant tear","proper personal protection","tears","epidemiology","recommendations","conjunctival secretions","conjunctivitis","close doctor-patient contact","genomics","clinical characteristics","Previous investigations","outbreak","transmitting","review"],"language":"en"},

However, newly identified viruses (NIVs) including human metapneumovirus and bocavirus and emergent viruses including SARS-CoV have already been exhaustively scrutinized. The clinical impact of most respiratory NIVs is attributable to one or two major strains but there are 100\u002B distinct HRVs and, because we have never sought them independently, we must arbitrarily divide the literature\u0027s clinical impact findings among them.

Many studies have indicated that the direct recognition of particular oligosaccharides on viral components by lectins is important for interactions between hosts and viruses. Herein, we aim to globally review the roles of this recognition by animal lectins in antiviral immune responses and viral pathogenesis. The different classes of mammalian lectins can either recognize carbohydrates to activate host immunity for viral elimination or can exploit those carbohydrates as susceptibility factors to facilitate viral entry, replication or assembly. Additionally, some arthropod C-type lectins were recently identified as key susceptibility factors that directly interact with multiple viruses and then facilitate infection. Summarization of the pleiotropic roles of direct viral recognition by animal lectins will benefit our understanding of host-virus interactions and could provide insight into the role of lectins in antiviral drug and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2015-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Pang, Xiaojing; Liu, Tao; Ning, Zhijie; Cheng, Gong","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f7d645dea0f766fefcd547a1b4a9ec29d2533cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6272511.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642837/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules20022272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal lectins","role of lectins","viral components","viral entry","viral pathogenesis","viral elimination","pleiotropic roles of direct viral recognition","carbohydrate recognition domain","carbohydrate recognition activity","different classes of mammalian lectins","arthropod C-type lectins","direct recognition of particular oligosaccharides","carbohydrates","key susceptibility factors","variety of carbohydrate structures","antiviral drug","virus interactions","understanding of host","host immunity","multiple viruses","antiviral immune responses","different cellular locations","specificities","features","group of proteins","replication","families","insight","vaccine development","CRD","modules","hosts","Summarization","assembly","infection","studies"],"language":"en"},

To uncover the dynamical mechanisms, the evolving spatiotemporal patterns and critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading are extremely important, which provide theoretical foundations for us to control epidemic spreading, predict collective behaviors in social systems, and so on. The coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much attention in many disciplines. In this review, we introduce recent progress in the study of coevolution spreading dynamics, emphasizing the contributions from the perspectives of statistical mechanics and network science. The theoretical methods, critical phenomena, phase transitions, interacting mechanisms, and effects of network topology for four representative types of coevolution spreading mechanisms, including the coevolution of biological contagions, social contagions, epidemic\u2013awareness, and epidemic\u2013resources, are presented in detail, and the challenges in this field as well as open issues for future studies are also discussed.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wei; Liu, Quan-Hui; Liang, Junhao; Hu, Yanqing; Zhou, Tao","journal":"Physics Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95d070f39f49f5d56d1330a2056f2e953d37af0f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3bf85a0f0bd73174d4dedcf1d902bcd33f8d01be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154519.xml.json","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02125v2.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308252/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2019.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0370157319302583; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157319302583","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic spreading","study of coevolution","critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading","coevolution of biological contagions","representative types of coevolution","social contagions","dynamical mechanisms","social systems","dynamics","collective behaviors","network science","real systems","theoretical methods","theoretical foundations","effects of network topology","evolving spatiotemporal patterns","information","phase transitions","perspectives of statistical mechanics","contributions","awareness","open issues","recent progress","complex networks","propagations of diseases","field","attention","future studies","review","resources","strong interactions","challenges","disciplines"],"language":"en"},

Recurrent asthma exacerbations cause a decline in lung function and, in childhood, are linked to development of persistent asthma. This position paper, from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, highlights the shortcomings of current treatment guidelines for patients suffering from frequent asthma exacerbations and those with difficult\u2010to\u2010treat asthma and severe treatment\u2010resistant asthma. It reviews current evidence that supports a call for increased awareness of (i) the seriousness of asthma exacerbations and (ii) the need for novel treatment strategies in specific forms of severe treatment\u2010resistant asthma. There is strong evidence linking asthma exacerbations with viral airway infection and underlying deficiencies in innate immunity and evidence of a synergism between viral infection and allergic mechanisms in increasing risk of exacerbations. Nonadherence to prescribed medication has been identified as a common clinical problem amongst adults and children with difficult\u2010to\u2010control asthma. Appropriate diagnosis, assessment of adherence and other potentially modifiable factors (such as passive or active smoking, ongoing allergen exposure, psychosocial factors) have to be a priority in clinical assessment of all patients with difficult\u2010to\u2010control asthma.

Efforts to recover donor lungs with reversible injuries using ex vivo perfusion systems are limited to \u003C24 hours of support. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of extending normothermic extracorporeal lung support to 4 days using cross-circulation with conscious swine. Methods A swine behavioral training program and custom enclosure were developed to enable multiday cross-circulation between extracorporeal lungs and recipient swine. Lungs were ventilated and perfused in a normothermic chamber for 4 days. Longitudinal analyses of extracorporeal lungs (ie, functional assessments, multiscale imaging, cytokine quantification, and cellular assays) and recipient swine (eg, vital signs and blood and tissue analyses) were performed. Results Throughout 4 days of normothermic support, extracorporeal lung function was maintained (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction \u003E400 mm Hg; compliance \u003E20 mL/cm H2O), and recipient swine were hemodynamically stable (lactate \u003C3 mmol/L; pH, 7.42 \u00B1 0.05). Radiography revealed well-aerated lower lobes and consolidation in upper lobes of extracorporeal lungs, and bronchoscopy showed healthy airways without edema or secretions. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL) 4, IL-6, and IL-10 levels increased less than 6-fold, whereas interferon gamma, IL-1\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels decreased from baseline to day 4. Histologic evaluations confirmed an intact blood\u2013gas barrier and outstanding preservation of airway and alveolar architecture. Cellular viability and metabolism in extracorporeal lungs were confirmed after 4 days. Conclusions We demonstrate feasibility of normothermic maintenance of extracorporeal lungs for 4 days by cross-circulation with conscious swine. Cross-circulation approaches could support the recovery of damaged lungs and enable organ bioengineering to improve transplant outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hozain, Ahmed E.; Tipograf, Yuliya; Pinezich, Meghan R.; Cunningham, Katherine M.; Donocoff, Rachel; Queen, Dawn; Fung, Kenmond; Marboe, Charles C.; Guenthart, Brandon A.; O\u0027Neill, John D.; Vunjak-Novakovic, Gordana; Bacchetta, Matthew","journal":"The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a92bf7defda97e4859f8b4869012db33da973a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094131.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022522319321464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.09.121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31761338/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522319321464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["upper lobes of extracorporeal lungs","Longitudinal analyses of extracorporeal lungs","donor lungs","normothermic extracorporeal lung support","recipient swine","feasibility of normothermic maintenance of extracorporeal lungs","days of normothermic support","conscious swine","extracorporeal lung function","recovery of damaged lungs","multiday cross-circulation","Cross-circulation approaches","normothermic chamber","hours of support","swine behavioral training program","Abstract Objectives Lung","intact blood","cellular assays","Cellular viability","tissue analyses","solid organ","tumor necrosis factor alpha levels","arterial oxygen tension","inspired oxygen fraction","well-aerated lower lobes","consolidation","outstanding preservation of airway","gas barrier","cytokine quantification","reversible injuries","custom enclosure","granulocyte-macrophage colony","functional assessments","vital signs","bronchoscopy","multiscale imaging","healthy airways","baseline","interleukin","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","perfusion systems","edema","alveolar architecture","Hg","Radiography","Methods","interferon gamma","fold","lactate","metabolism","Histologic evaluations","mmol","compliance","secretions","Efforts","Conclusions","H2O","Results","transplant outcomes","transplantation"],"language":"en"},

Cell-based antiviral activity assays utilizing different variants of mGRFT indicated that the monomeric form of the lectin had greatly reduced activity against HIV-1, suggesting that the antiviral activity of GRFT stems from crosslinking and aggregation of viral particles via multivalent interactions between GRFT and oligosaccharides present on HIV envelope glycoproteins.

By contrast, avian influenza viruses such as the H5N1 virus that recently emerged in Southeast Asia can cause severe disease when transferred from birds to previously healthy people (\u201Cavian influenza\u201D). Most H5N1 patients present with fever, cough and shortness of breath that progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome. In seasonal influenza, viral replication remains confined to the respiratory tract, but limited studies indicate that H5N1 infections are characterized by systemic viral dissemination, high cytokine levels and multiorgan failure. Gastrointestinal infection and encephalitis also occur. The licensed anti-influenza drugs (the M2 ion channel blockers, amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir) are beneficial for uncomplicated seasonal influenza, but appropriate dosing regimens for severe seasonal or H5N1 viral infections have not been defined. Treatment options may be limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Ribavirin has also been used to a limited extent to treat influenza. This article reviews approaches to therapy, including licensed drugs and treatments under development, including high-dose oseltamivir; parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitors, peramivir and zanamivir; dimeric forms of zanamivir; the RNA polymerase inhibitor T-705; a ribavirin prodrug, viramidine; polyvalent and monoclonal antibodies; and combination therapies.","publish_time":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beigel, John; Bray, Mike","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2592afa22bf6abcadfafb198248ed2ddf9c0e54.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f938761c3d14ebb4d481f12ab3688ae479fd6425.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2346583.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2346583?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18328578/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208000235; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.01.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208000235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["uncomplicated seasonal influenza","avian influenza viruses","H5N1 viral infections","H1N1 subtypes of influenza","licensed anti-influenza drugs","H5N1 virus","H5N1 infections","viral replication","H5N1 patients","systemic viral dissemination","life-threatening primary viral pneumonia","respiratory tract","licensed drugs","limited studies","limited extent","dimeric forms of zanamivir","administered neuraminidase inhibitors","high-dose oseltamivir","febrile upper respiratory illness","severe disease","bacterial pneumonia","adult respiratory distress syndrome","resistant viruses","ribavirin prodrug","high cytokine levels","appropriate dosing regimens","M2 ion channel blockers","adults","ill persons","amantadine","rimantadine","peramivir","complications","development","monoclonal antibodies","RNA polymerase inhibitor T","viramidine","fever","cough","therapy","treatments","children","multiorgan failure","Southeast Asia","rapid emergence of drug","elderly","immunodeficient","shortness of breath","birds","healthy people","infants","combination therapies","H3N2","contrast","article reviews","Gastrointestinal infection","encephalitis"],"language":"en"},

There are situations however that still require the undertaking of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) with potentially high exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2 transmission through droplet, contact and possibly airborne routes. The objective of this paper is to explore a structured way for the operative team to approach AGP to reduce aerosolisation of secretions, decrease open airway time and minimise staff exposure. METHODS: The authors (otolaryngologists, anaesthetists and nursing staff) created a unified operative team checklist based on collation of national and international specialty society statements, local state government recommendations, hospital policies and literature review. Simulation was undertaken and the checklist was refined after performing AGP on patients with unknown (presumed positive) COVID-19 status. RESULTS: An 8 step operative team checklist is provided describing details for the immediate pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative journey of the patient to encourage healthcare workers to reflect upon and modify usual practice during AGP to mitigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes or retrieval of an inhaled airway foreign body is used to illustrate the steps however the checklist structure is modifiable for other AGP and adaptable for local needs. CONCLUSIONS: At a time of overwhelming and changing information and recommendations, an operative team checklist may provide some structure to healthcare workers undertaking AGP to reduce anxiety, maintain focus, prompt consideration of alternatives and potentially reduce risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soma, Marlene; Jacobson, Ian; Brewer, Jessica; Blondin, Angela; Davidson, Gretel; Singham, Shamani","journal":"Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86260af807c5a47b00cfb16c2844a6239bac8a55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194841.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587620302184?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388083/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587620302184","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AGP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unified operative team checklist","step operative team checklist","approach AGP","checklist structure","immediate pre-operative","post-operative journey","staff exposure","high exposure of healthcare workers","SARS-CoV","COVID","patients","open airway time","local state government recommendations","nursing staff","local needs","time of overwhelming","undertaking of aerosol","inhaled airway foreign body","international specialty society statements","collation of national","describing details","retrieval","hospital policies","diagnostic purposes","aerosolisation of secretions","anxiety","otolaryngologists","focus","example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy","information","literature review","prompt consideration of alternatives","structured way","authors","droplet","pandemic","anaesthetists","steps","procedures","usual practice","paper","countries","world","health services","status","transmission","RESULTS","airborne routes","risk","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","situations","condition","Simulation"],"language":"en"},

As part of the 686 Program, teams \u201Cunlocked\u201D and provided continuous mental health care to people with severe mental disorders who were found in restraints and largely untreated in their family homes. We implemented a nation-wide two-stage follow-up study to measure the effectiveness and sustainability of the \u201Cunlocking and treatment\u201D intervention and its impact on the well-being of patients\u2019 families. METHODS: 266 patients unlocked from 2005 in \u201C686\u201D demonstration sites across China were recruited in Stage One of the study in 2009. In 2012, 230 of the 266 cases were re-interviewed (the Stage Two study). Outcome measures included the patient medication adherence and social functioning, family burden ratings, and relocking rate. We utilized pre-post tests to analyze the changes over time following the unlocking efforts. RESULTS: 96% of patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Prior to unlocking, their total time locked ranged from two weeks to 28 years, with 32% having been locked multiple times. The number of persons regularly taking medicines increased from one person at the time of unlocking to 74% in 2009 and 76% in 2012. Pre-post tests showed sustained improvement in patient social functioning and significant reductions in family burden. Over 92% of patients remained free of restraints in 2012. CONCLUSION: Practice-based evidence from our study suggests an important model for protecting the human rights of people with mental disorders and keeping them free of restraints can be achieved by providing accessible, community based mental health services with continuity of care. China\u2019s \u201C686\u201D Program can inform similar efforts in low-resource settings where community locking of patients is practiced.","publish_time":"2015-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guan, Lili; Liu, Jin; Wu, Xia Min; Chen, Dafang; Wang, Xun; Ma, Ning; Wang, Yan; Good, Byron; Ma, Hong; Yu, Xin; Good, Mary-Jo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c90c4e5ca7134a20586234aae4f4f8b6b42c05fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4388503.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25848800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe mental disorders","time of unlocking","continuous mental health care","community based mental health services","basic mental health services","unlocking efforts","evidence-based care","stage follow-up study","free of restraints","demonstration program","human rights of people","community locking of patients","patient social functioning","family burden ratings","continuity of care","Practice-based evidence","family homes","pre-post tests","total time locked ranged","similar efforts","demonstration sites","patient medication adherence","sustained improvement","low-resource settings","significant reductions","changes","access","impact","weeks","important model","Outcome measures","relocking rate","effectiveness","well-being of patients\u2019 families","medicines","treatment","intervention","cases","sustainability","teams","CONCLUSION","scale","number of persons","years","multiple times","BACKGROUND","China\u2019s","METHODS","RESULTS","schizophrenia"],"language":"en"},

Although there have been many reports of such work done for SARS\u2013CoV, these were mainly focused on the immune responses of humans and mice. In this study, we aim to search for and compare immunodominant regions of the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins which are recognized by sera from different animal species, including mouse, rat, rabbit, civet, pig and horse. Twelve overlapping recombinant protein fragments were produced in Escherichia coli, six each for the S and N proteins, which covered the entire coding region of the two proteins. Using a membrane-strip based Western blot approach, the reactivity of each antigen fragment against a panel of animal sera was determined. Immunodominant regions containing linear epitopes, which reacted with sera from all the species tested, were identified for both proteins. The S3 fragment (aa 402\u2013622) and the N4 fragment (aa 220\u2013336) were the most immunodominant among the six S and N fragments, respectively. Antibodies raised against the S3 fragment were able to block the binding of a panel of S-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to SARS\u2013CoV in ELISA, further demonstrating the immunodominance of this region. Based on these findings, one-step competition ELISAs were established which were able to detect SARS\u2013CoV antibodies from human and at least seven different animal species. Considering that a large number of animal species are known to be susceptible to SARS\u2013CoV, these assays will be a useful tool to trace the origin and transmission of SARS\u2013CoV and to minimise the risk of animal-to-human transmission.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Meng; Stevens, Vicky; Berry, Jody D.; Crameri, Gary; McEachern, Jennifer; Tu, Changchun; Shi, Zhengli; Liang, Guodong; Weingartl, Hana; Cardosa, Jane; Eaton, Bryan T.; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51d9ddb59469f2f4db39d8bebf3873cb0e97c5d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094251.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2007.11.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18191140/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175907003602; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175907003602","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV antibodies","different animal species","transmission of SARS","N proteins","panel of animal sera","panel of S","risk of animal","S3 fragment","large number of animal species","antigen fragment","N4 fragment","Abstract Knowledge of immunodominant regions","human transmission","specific monoclonal antibodies","entire coding region","overlapping recombinant protein fragments","major viral antigens","rational design of effective vaccines","mouse","mAb","Western blot approach","rabbit","civet","reactivity","origin","diagnostic tests","membrane-strip","pig","Escherichia coli","assays","linear epitopes","nucleocapsid","spike","binding","one-step competition ELISAs","useful tool","immune responses of humans","mice","findings","horse","work","immunodominance","reports","study"],"language":"en"},

Probiotics have reduced viral infections in children attending day care. Limited data are available on the effects of probiotics on the nasopharyngeal presence of respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVES: To assess, whether probiotics could decrease nasopharyngeal occurrence of respiratory viruses in Finnish conscripts. STUDY DESIGN: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 90- and 150-day intervention study, 239 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 192 symptomatic conscripts receiving daily chewable probiotic tablet containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (46.9%) or control tablet (53.1%) on visits to a garrison\u0027s health care center due to symptoms of infection. The presence of respiratory viruses was tested by PCR-methods, and viral findings were compared between the intervention groups. RESULTS: 184 (76.9%) nasopharyngeal samples were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Picornaviruses were the most common viruses and were detected in 155 (84.2%) of samples. Of these, 143 (92.3%) were rhinovirus-positive and 20 (12.9%) were enterovirus-positive. The control group had 83 (64%) and the probiotic group 72 (66%) picornavirus infections (p = 0.79). Monthly distribution of picornaviruses showed that there were less picornavirus findings after 3 months in the probiotic group than in the control group (p = 0.0069). However, probiotics did not reduce picornavirus occurrence in other months. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, probiotics did not reduce viral occurrence in symptomatic conscripts. However, probiotics decreased the presence of picornaviruses after 3 months, which may imply that probiotics play a role against viruses causing common cold. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved in order to target specific probiotics on specific respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2014-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehtoranta, Liisa; Kalima, Kim; He, Liang; Lappalainen, Maija; Roivainen, Merja; N\u00E4rki\u00F6, Mervi; M\u00E4kel\u00E4, Mika; Siitonen, Simo; Korpela, Riitta; Pitk\u00E4ranta, Anne","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e833f88126324b7f8d950b2601e1c273fdaafa4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185430.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.03.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214001292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793963/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214001292","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific probiotics","nasopharyngeal occurrence of respiratory viruses","nasopharyngeal presence of respiratory viruses","specific respiratory viruses","effects of probiotics","common viruses","viral infections","viral occurrence","nasopharyngeal samples","probiotic group","control group","Viral upper respiratory tract infections","viral findings","symptomatic conscripts","picornavirus infections","picornavirus occurrence","months","presence of picornaviruses","nasopharyngeal swab samples","Finnish conscripts","picornavirus findings","control tablet","chewable probiotic tablet","day care","day intervention study","rhinovirus-positive","enterovirus-positive","Monthly distribution of picornaviruses","STUDY DESIGN","intervention groups","garrison\u0027s health care center","Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG","Bifidobacterium animalis","visits","BACKGROUND","children","lactis BB","PCR-methods","mechanisms","symptoms of infection","order","role","Limited data","investigations","placebo","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The development of rapid screening assays is essential for antiviral drug discovery. Thus, a screening system for anti-SARS-CoV agents was developed, which evaluated compound potency, specificity and cytotoxicity at the initial screening phase. Cell lines were engineered to constitutively express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and used to detect (1) antiviral potency in SARS-CoV infection tests; (2) antiviral specificity in tests using the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); and (3) cytotoxicity in the same assays without virus challenge. The assay system involves minimal manipulation after assay set-up, facilitates automated read-out and minimizes risks associated with hazardous viruses. The suitability of this assay system in drug discovery was demonstrated by screening of 3388 small molecule compounds. The results show that these assays can be applied to high-throughput screening for identification of inhibitors selectively active against SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ivens, Tania; Eynde, Christel Van den; Acker, Koen Van; Nijs, Erik; Dams, G\u00E9ry; Bettens, Eva; Ohagen, Asa; Pauwels, Rudi; Hertogs, Kurt","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a39675856b079cff5438b3af8df92c4034bc741.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112772.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093405001618; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093405001618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["screening system","assay system","antiviral specificity","antiviral potency","SARS-CoV infection tests","anti-SARS-CoV agents","antiviral drug discovery","active antiviral compounds","development of rapid screening assays","high-throughput screening","initial screening phase","assay set-up","risks","cytotoxicity","compound potency","virus challenge","porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","specific therapeutic agents","small molecule compounds","outbreak","need","identification of inhibitors","emerging viral diseases","human health","minimal manipulation","TGEV","automated read-out","enhanced green fluorescent protein","EGFP","global spread","suitability","hazardous viruses","severity","Cell lines","results"],"language":"en"},

Receiving hemodialysis treatments in an outpatient dialysis facility significantly contributes to patients\u2019 risks for infection. In dialysis units, patient-to-patient transmission of viral pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus can occur; proper screening and vaccination of patients can decrease the risk for transmission. Strict adherence to hand hygiene, use of appropriate personal protective equipment, transmission-based precautions, and maintaining aseptic technique while connecting the access to the hemodialysis machine can substantially decrease the likelihood of bacterial infections. With an effective infection control program in place, infection prevention becomes part of the dialysis facility\u2019s culture and results in improved patient safety. In this installment of the Core Curriculum series, we highlight best practices that should be followed by health care workers in the dialysis unit and discuss the role of the medical director in promoting initiatives to reduce infection rates.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waheed, Sana; Philipneri, Marie","journal":"American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272638620306119; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.02.441; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272638620306119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444070/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dialysis patients","dialysis units","infection rates","infection prevention","patient population","dialysis facility\u2019s culture","outpatient dialysis facility","improved patient safety","patient transmission of viral pathogens","hepatitis C virus","hepatitis B virus","infections account","effective infection control program","human immunodeficiency virus","transmission-based precautions","likelihood of bacterial infections","vaccination of patients","hemodialysis treatments","hemodialysis machine","overall mortality rates","appropriate personal protective equipment","place","results","major share of hospitalizations","hand hygiene","proper screening","Core Curriculum series","patients\u2019 risks","health care workers","best practices","aseptic technique","access","role","initiatives","leading cause of death","medical director","installment","Strict adherence","addition","cardiovascular disease","decade"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we highlight works from the past 20 years in which inorganic chemistry and nanotechnology were implemented in each of the core components that make up a diagnostic test. First, we present how inorganic biomarkers and their properties are leveraged for infectious disease detection. In the following section, we detail metal-based technologies that have been employed for sample preparation and biomarker isolation from sample matrices. We then describe how inorganic- and nanomaterial-based probes have been utilized in point-of-care diagnostics for signal generation. The following section discusses instrumentation for signal readout in resource-limited settings. Next, we highlight the detection of nucleic acids at the point of care as an emerging application of inorganic chemistry.

We introduce a novel approach to calculate the transfer rate from the free environment to the isolated environment, and we incorporate into the model the fact that many individuals were misdiagnosed as SARS suspected and hence were mistakenly put in the isolated environment due to lack of fast and effective SARS diagnostic tests. We develop some methods for the parameter identification using the daily reported data from the Ministry of Health of China. Simulations based on these parameters agree with the accural data well, thus provide additional validation of the model. We then vary some parameters to assess the effectiveness of different control measures: these new parameters correspond to the situation when the quarantine measures in the free-environment were prematurely relaxed (we thus observe the second outbreak with the maximal number of daily SARS patients much higher than the first outbreak) or when the quarantine time of SARS patients is postponed (we observe delayed peak time but with much higher number of SARS patients at the peak).

COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. The clinical findings include changes in ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function. When cardiac MRI is infeasible, cardiac CT angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns. Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered. Where the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.

The MERS-CoV is a RNA virus with protein envelope. On the outer surface, virus has spike like glycoprotein which is responsible for the attachment and entrance inside host cells. There is no specific treatment for the MERS-CoV till now, but drugs are in pipeline which bind with the spike glycoprotein and inhibit its entrance host cells.

Conditional ablation of lymphotoxin-\u03B2 receptor (LT\u03B2R) expression in LN FRCs and their mesenchymal progenitors in developing LNs revealed that LT\u03B2R-signaling in these cells was not essential for the formation of LNs. Although T cell zone reticular cells had lost podoplanin expression, they still formed a functional conduit system and showed enhanced expression of myofibroblastic markers. However, essential immune functions of FRCs, including homeostatic chemokine and interleukin-7 expression, were impaired. These changes in T cell zone reticular cell function were associated with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Thus, myofibroblasic FRC precursors are able to generate the basic T cell zone infrastructure, whereas LT\u03B2R-dependent maturation of FRCs guarantees full immunocompetence and hence optimal LN function during infection.","publish_time":"2013-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chai, Qian; Onder, Lucas; Scandella, Elke; Gil-Cruz, Cristina; Perez-Shibayama, Christian; Cupovic, Jovana; Danuser, Renzo; Sparwasser, Tim; Luther, Sanjiv A.; Thiel, Volker; R\u00FClicke, Thomas; Stein, Jens V.; Hehlgans, Thomas; Ludewig, Burkhard","journal":"Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1e8a0bd161bf6faee1a25dd4e21de42937f05b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111182.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761313001519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23623380/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2013.03.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761313001519","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FRC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LN FRCs","T cell zone reticular cells","T cell zone reticular cell function","basic T cell zone infrastructure","fibroblastic reticular cells","LT\u03B2R-dependent maturation of FRCs","lost podoplanin expression","optimal LN function","essential immune functions of FRCs","enhanced expression of myofibroblastic markers","developing LNs","viral infection","formation of LNs","\u03B2 receptor","immunocompetence","paracortex","mesenchymal progenitors","lymph node","homeostatic chemokine","increased susceptibility","interleukin","changes","functional conduit system","stromal scaffold","Conditional ablation of lymphotoxin","myofibroblasic FRC precursors","Summary"],"language":"en"},

The advent of molecular assays has improved the identification of viruses in patients with CAP and according to published studies, viruses account for 11-55% of adult CAP cases. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: In the present study, the frequency of respiratory viruses was evaluated in respiratory samples collected from 414 patients with CAP admitted to 26 ICUs in the Lombardy Region (10 million inhabitants) during seven winter-spring seasons (2009\u20132016). RESULTS: In 226 (54.6%) patients one or more respiratory viruses were identified, while 188 (45.4%) patients were negative. A single virus infection was observed in 214/226 (94.7%) patients; while, in 12/226 (5.3%) at least two respiratory viruses were detected. Influenza A was the most common virus in 140/226 patients (61.9%) followed by rhinoviruses (33/226, 14.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (13/226, 5.8%), influenza B virus (9/226, 4.0%), human coronaviruses (9/226, 4.0%), cytomegalovirus (9/226, 4.0%) and human metapneumovirus (1/226, 0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections are present in a consistent proportion of patients admitted to the ICU for CAP. Influenza A and rhinovirus accounted for three-quarters of all CAP in ICU patients. The use of lower respiratory instead of upper respiratory samples might be useful in the diagnosis of viral CAP.","publish_time":"2017-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piralla, Antonio; Mariani, Bianca; Rovida, Francesca; Baldanti, Fausto","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1db02f2c28f423f961c0146d1dcb9d7155618a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172430.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28527970/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217301300; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217301300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of respiratory viruses","frequency of respiratory viruses","ICU patients","respiratory syncytial virus","upper respiratory samples","identification of viruses","viruses account","use of lower respiratory","consistent proportion of patients","influenza B virus","common virus","adult CAP cases","present study","single virus infection","STUDY DESIGN","Viral infections","diagnosis of viral","human coronaviruses","human metapneumovirus","etiology of community","published studies","inhabitants","ICUs","quarters","Lombardy Region","advent of molecular assays","CONCLUSIONS","pneumonia","BACKGROUND","winter-spring seasons","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","rhinoviruses","cytomegalovirus"],"language":"en"},

In light of the need to consider ethical issues proactively as a part of epidemic preparedness, we use the case of a Zika virus HCT to explore whether and when HCTs might be ethically justified to combat emerging infectious diseases. We conclude that emerging infectious diseases could be appropriate candidates for HCTs and we identify relevant considerations and provide a case example to illustrate when they might be ethically acceptable.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palacios, Ricardo; Shah, Seema K.","journal":"Trials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eb3bdc336b90a70201e28477934062f67afcbcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6921433.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-019-3843-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852506/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCTs","future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","case example","Zika virus HCT","enrolling individuals","appropriate candidates","complications","vaccines","controlled setting","relevant considerations","treatments","natural exposure","order","participants","powerful tools","available interventions","Human challenge trials","need","ethical issues","substantial risk","uncertainty","epidemic preparedness","light"],"language":"en"},

Viral agents cause the majority of sore throats. However, there is not currently a score to diagnose viral sore throat. The aims of this study were (i) to find the rate of bacterial and viral causes, (ii) to show the seasonal variations and (iii) to form a new scoring system to diagnose viral sore throat. METHODS. A throat culture for group A beta haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) and a nasopharyngeal swab to detect 16 respiratory viruses were obtained from each patient. Over a period of 52 weeks, a total of 624 throat cultures and polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the clinical score. RESULTS. Viral infection was found in 277 patients (44.3%), and GABHS infection was found in 116 patients (18.5%). An infectious cause was found in 356 patients (57.1%). Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected infectious agent overall (highest in November, 34.5%), and the highest GABHS rate was in November (32.7%). Analysis of data provided a scoring system, called the Mistik Score, to diagnose viral sore throat. The predictive model for positive viral analysis included the following variables: absence of headache, stuffy nose, sneezing, temperature of \u226537.5\u00B0C on physical examination, and the absence of tonsillar exudate and/or swelling. The probability of a positive viral analysis for a score of 5 was 82.1%. CONCLUSION. The Mistik Score may be useful to diagnose viral sore throat.

Efficient monitoring of infectious disease transmission is critical to prevent and manage infectious disease epidemics.

By analysing infectious disease biomarkers in wastewater taken from wastewater collection points, the transmission of infectious diseases in certain areas can be comprehensively monitored in near real time. This short review presents WBE as a surveillance and early warning system for infectious disease outbreaks regarding pathogens with pandemic potential. We also discuss the challenges and perspective of WBE in infectious disease surveillance and early warning.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Kang; Zhang, Kuankuan; Du, Wei; Ali, Waqar; Feng, Xinbing; Zhang, Hua","journal":"Curr Opin Environ Sci Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af81b47cf0805ceeb123c49b647dc778e334c5c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212976.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468584420300337?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468584420300337; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2020.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395676/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WBE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious disease surveillance","infectious disease outbreaks","infectious disease biomarkers","infectious disease epidemics","early warning of infectious disease transmission","transmission of infectious diseases","Efficient monitoring of infectious disease transmission","early warning system","perspective of WBE","pathogens","wastewater collection points","Wastewater-based epidemiology","great potential","efficient approach","pandemic potential","certain areas","main threats","public health","short review","challenges","real time"],"language":"en"},

The investigation of the antibacterial effect of essential oils (EOs), which are commonly used nowadays in cosmetics, health care, traditional medicine and food industry, could be one of the promising solutions for this worldwide problem. EOs have a complex mode of action due to their multiple composition. Respiratory tract diseases (RTDs) associated with bacterial infection and inflammation affect a large number of people from every age group worldwide. Because of volatility, EOs can easily reach the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract via inhalation. Moreover, due to their antimicrobial and anti\u2010inflammatory potency, they offer an effective treatment in respiratory tract infections (RTIs). The purpose of this review is to describe the most frequently developing infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and to show methods used for the determination of the antibacterial activity of EOs by gaseous contact. The mode of action of EOs on bacterial cells and their anti\u2010inflammatory action are also discussed. Results coming from recently performed in vivo animal studies as well as human trials are also reported. Patents deal with the role of EOs and their volatile constituents in the treatment of RTIs are also introduced. On the whole, this review aimed at showing EOs as potential antimicrobials and as anti\u2010inflammatory agents to alleviate symptoms and signs of RTDs including RTIs.

Only one mAb is licensed for use against an infectious disease, although there are many in various stages of development. This situation is peculiar given that serum therapy was one of the first effective treatments for microbial diseases and that specific antibodies have numerous antimicrobial properties. The underdevelopment and underutilization of mAb therapies for microbial diseases has various complex explanations that include the current availability of antimicrobial drugs, small markets, high costs and microbial antigenic variation. However, there are signs that the climate for mAb therapeutics in infectious diseases is changing given increasing antibiotic drug resistance, the emergence of new pathogenic microbes for which no therapy is available, and development of mAb cocktail formulations. Currently, the major hurdle for the widespread introduction of mAb therapies for microbial diseases is economic, given the high costs of immunoglobulin preparations and relatively small markets. Despite these obstacles there are numerous opportunities for mAb development against microbial diseases and the development of radioimmunotherapy provides new options for enhancing the magic bullet. Hence, there is cautious optimism that the years ahead will see more mAbs in clinical use against microbial diseases.","publish_time":"2009-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saylor, Carolyn; Dadachova, Ekaterina; Casadevall, Arturo","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e16c0d9bb90fc238cf84b89b778918e0691523dc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ee3d688735c03aba17e1c96d1551b9a7100c17dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2810317.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09014637; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.09.105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20006139/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09014637; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2810317?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microbial diseases","mAb development","inflammatory diseases","field of infectious diseases","mAb therapeutics","underutilization of mAb therapies","development of mAb cocktail formulations","widespread introduction of mAb therapies","microbial antigenic variation","new options","development of radioimmunotherapy","various stages of development","small markets","numerous antimicrobial properties","high costs of immunoglobulin preparations","emergence of new pathogenic microbes","numerous opportunities","serum therapy","clinical use","given increasing antibiotic drug resistance","various complex explanations","current availability of antimicrobial drugs","specific antibodies","revolution","treatment of neoplastic","mAbs","climate","situation","effective treatments","major hurdle","years","monoclonal antibody","magic bullet","signs","obstacles","underdevelopment","cautious optimism"],"language":"en"},

Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can directly affect host gene pools by stable colonization. DNA viruses can be genetically complex and have evolved many unique viral genes. The retroviruses show both quasispecies-based rapid evolution and host-linked slow coevolution (e.g., endogenous retroviruses). Thus, virus evolution impacts all life and viral emergence continues to threaten human health.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Villarreal, L.

Coronaviruses infect various animals, but to date, relatively few coronaviruses have been identified in rodents worldwide. The evolution and ecology of coronaviruses in rodent have not been fully investigated. RESULTS: In this study, we collected 177 intestinal samples from thress species of rodents in Jianchuan County, Yunnan Province, China. Alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus were detected in 23 rodent samples from three species, namely Apodemus chevrieri (21/98), Eothenomys fidelis (1/62), and Apodemus ilex (1/17). We further characterized the full-length genome of an alphacoronavirus from the A. chevrieri rat and named it as AcCoV-JC34. The AcCoV-JC34 genome was 27,649 nucleotides long and showed a structure similar to the HKU2 bat coronavirus. Comparing the normal transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), 3 variant TRS sequences upstream the spike (S), ORF3, and ORF8 genes were found in the genome of AcCoV-JC34. In the conserved replicase domains, AcCoV-JC34 was most closely related to Rattus norvegicus coronavirus LNRV but diverged from other alphacoronaviruses, indicating that AcCoV-JC34 and LNRV may represent a novel alphacoronavirus species. However, the S and nucleocapsid proteins showed low similarity to those of LRNV, with 66.5 and 77.4% identities, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the S genes of AcCoV-JC34, LRNV, and HKU2 formed a distinct lineage with all known coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Both alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses were detected in Apodemus chevrieri in the Yunnan Province of China, indicating that Apodemus chevrieri is an important host for coronavirus. Several new features were identified in the genome of an Apodemus chevrieri coronavirus. The phylogenetic distance to other coronaviruses suggests a variable origin and evolutionary route of the S genes of AcCoV-JC34, LRNV, and HKU2. These results indicate that the diversity of rodent coronaviruses is much higher than previously expected. Further surveillance and functional studies of these coronaviruses will help to better understand the importance of rodent as host for coronaviruses.

Public policy could advocate all these concerns. This study was conducted to identify the main themes on patient safety of stakeholders expressed before and after the Patient Safety Act was enacted in Korea in 2015. Design Longitudinal observational study of the interests of healthcare stakeholders generated between January 2014 and September 2018. Materials and methods Text data were collected from 2,487 documents on 18 websites that were identified as representative healthcare stakeholder groups of consumers, providers, government, and researchers. A Korean natural language processing (NLP) package, manual review, and synonym dictionary were used for data preprocessing, and we adopted the unsupervised NLP method of probabilistic topic modeling and latent Dirichlet allocation. A linear trend analysis over time, a qualitative step involving two external experts, and original text reviews were performed to validate the identified topics. Results Forty-one topics were identified, and the most common concerns of stakeholders were institutional infection control as triggered by the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in early 2015, and infusion-related infection from late 2017 until the middle of 2018. The other top-three concerns of the stakeholder groups were highly similar, while research topics were limited to the perceptions of providers and the activities and culture of hospitals. Five topics showed statistically significant increasing trends over time, while another five showed decreasing trends (both P \u003C 0.05). In the qualitative step, we confirmed 35 themes and revised the other 6. Conclusions A common concern among stakeholders was hospital infection control, ranging from nosocomial infections to those brought in by family visiting patients. Government policies and systemic approaches to patient safety were highlighted by different stakeholders. Researchers were focused on hospital sociocultural factors at both the organizational and clinician levels.

Methods Five national societies, The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; The American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy; The American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery; The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the American Rhinologic Society formed an expert panel from multiple disciplines. Over two days, the panel developed definitions for rhinosinusitis and outlined strategies for design of clinical trials. Results Committee members agreed to adopt the term \u201Crhinosinusitis\u201D and reached consensus on definitions and strategies for clinical research on acute presumed bacterial rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis, and classic allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Symptom and objective criteria, measures for monitoring research progress, and use of symptom scoring tools, quality-of-life instruments, radiologic studies, and rhinoscopic assessment were outlined for each condition.

Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.","publish_time":"2018-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilbertson, Sarah; Federspiel, Joel D.; Hartenian, Ella; Cristea, Ileana M.; Glaunsinger, Britt","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/295972","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytoplasmic mRNA decay","global mRNA decay","mRNA decay landscape","mRNA turnover","Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay","protein localization","RBPs","multiple stages of gene expression","distal stages of gene expression","results","changes","repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein","subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins","relocalized cytoplasmic poly","RNA polymerase","mass spectrometry","human cells","tandem mass tag","tail-associated proteins","gammaherpesviral endonuclease","new role","nuclear translocation","abundance of numerous factors","viral infection","signals","mechanism","promoters","Alterations","data","processes"],"language":"en"},

Influenza typically contributes substantially to the burden of ARI, but only limited data are available on influenza activity and seasonality in Jordan. METHODS: Syndromic case definitions were used to identify individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) admitted to four sentinel hospitals in Jordan. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and typed as influenza A or B, with influenza A further subtyped. RESULTS: From January 2008\u2013February 2014, 2891 SARI cases were tested for influenza, and 257 (9%) were positive. While 73% of all SARI cases were under 5 years of age, only 57% of influenza\u2010positive cases were under 5 years of age. Eight (3%) influenza\u2010positive cases died. An annual seasonal pattern of influenza activity was observed. The proportion of influenza\u2010positive cases peaked during November\u2013January (14\u201342%) in the non\u2010pandemic years. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in Jordan. The seasonal pattern of influenza aligns with known Northern Hemisphere seasonality.

By seeding distal sites with antigen-specific effector or memory lymphocytes, the foundation is laid for the animal\u0027s mucosal immune system to respond with a secondary response should to this antigen be encountered at this site in the future. The common mucosal immune system has been studied quite extensively in rodent models but less so in large animal models such as the pig. Reasons for this paucity of reported induction of the common mucosal immune system in this species may be that distal mucosal sites were examined but no induction was observed and therefore it was not reported. However, we suspect that the majority of investigators simply did not sample distal mucosal sites and therefore there is little evidence of immune response induction in the literature. It is our hope that more pig immunologists and infectious disease experts who perform mucosal immunizations or inoculations on pigs will sample distal mucosal sites and report their findings, whether results are positive or negative. In this review, we highlight papers that show that immunization/inoculation using one route triggers mucosal immune system induction locally, systemically, and within at least one distal mucosal site. Only by understanding whether immunizations at one site triggers immunity throughout the common mucosal immune system can we rationally develop vaccines for the pig, and through these works we can gather evidence about the mucosal immune system that may be extrapolated to other livestock species or humans.","publish_time":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Heather L.; Obradovic, Milan R.","journal":"Mol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cdef8032be07bd4d378689ea438e7eca25b8620.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132386.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2014.09.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589014002405; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589014002405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25242212/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distal mucosal sites","common mucosal immune system","mucosal immunizations","animal\u0027s mucosal immune system","distal sites","route triggers mucosal immune system induction","distal mucosa sites","little evidence of immune response induction","paucity of reported induction","site triggers immunity","pig immunologists","majority of lymphocytes","memory lymphocytes","secondary response","livestock species","local mucosa","rodent models","majority of investigators","antigen-specific effector","large animal models","infectious disease experts","inoculations","pigs","foundation","home","instructions","portion","findings","results","papers","hope","Reasons","literature","vaccines","humans","review","future"],"language":"en"},

However, data are scarce on the differences in tonsillar virus infections and immune responses between patients with tonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis. We investigated the differences in virus detection and T cell and interferon gene expression in patients undergoing tonsillectomy due to tonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis. METHODS: Tonsils of 89 surgical patients with tonsillar hypertrophy (n = 47) or recurrent tonsillitis (n = 42) were analysed. Patients were carefully characterized clinically. Standard questionnaire was used to asses preceding and allergy symptoms. Respiratory viruses were analysed in tonsils and nasopharynx by PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyse intratonsillar gene expressions of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-\u03B2, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet. RESULTS: Median age of the subjects was 15 years (range 2\u201360). Patients with tonsillar hypertrophy were younger, smoked less often, had less pollen allergy and had more adenovirus, bocavirus-1, coronavirus and rhinovirus in nasopharynx (all P \u003C 0.05). Only bocavirus-1 was more often detected in hypertrophic tonsils (P \u003C 0.05). In age-adjusted analysis, tonsillar hypertrophy was associated with higher mRNA expressions of IL-37 (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intratonsillar T cell and interferon gene expressions appeared to be relatively stable for both tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis. Of the studied cytokines, only newly discovered anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37, was independently associated with tonsillar hypertrophy showing slightly stronger anti-inflammatory response in these patients.

Interventions can reduce the impact of an outbreak and buy time until vaccines are developed, but they may have high social and economic costs. The non-linear effect on the epidemic dynamics means that suitable strategies crucially depend on the precise aim of the intervention. National pandemic influenza plans rarely contain clear statements of policy objectives or prioritization of potentially conflicting aims, such as minimizing mortality (depending on the severity of a pandemic) or peak prevalence or limiting the socio-economic burden of contact-reducing interventions. We use epidemiological models of influenza A to investigate how contact-reducing interventions and availability of antiviral drugs or pre-pandemic vaccines contribute to achieving particular policy objectives. Our analyses show that the ideal strategy depends on the aim of an intervention and that the achievement of one policy objective may preclude success with others, e.g., constraining peak demand for public health resources may lengthen the duration of the epidemic and hence its economic and social impact. Constraining total case numbers can be achieved by a range of strategies, whereas strategies which additionally constrain peak demand for services require a more sophisticated intervention. If, for example, there are multiple objectives which must be achieved prior to the availability of a pandemic vaccine (i.e., a time-limited intervention), our analysis shows that interventions should be implemented several weeks into the epidemic, not at the very start. This observation is shown to be robust across a range of constraints and for uncertainty in estimates of both R(0) and the timing of vaccine availability. These analyses highlight the need for more precise statements of policy objectives and their assumed consequences when planning and implementing strategies to mitigate the impact of an influenza pandemic.","publish_time":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hollingsworth, T.

In this study, a CDA was performed in 284 deceased patients from Mozambique (n = 223) and Brazil (n = 61). In depth histopathological and microbiological analyses were carried out in all cases dying of cryptococcosis. We determined the cryptococcal species, the molecular and sero-mating types and antifungal susceptibility. We also described the organs affected and reviewed the clinical presentation and patient management. Among the 284 cases included, 17 fatal cryptococcal infections were diagnosed. Cryptococcus was responsible for 16 deaths among the 163 HIV-positive patients (10%; 95%CI: 6\u201315%), including four maternal deaths. One third of the cases corresponded to C. gattii (VGI and VGIV molecular types, B\u03B1 and C\u03B1 strains) and the remaining infections typed were caused by C. neoformans var. Grubii (all VNI and A\u03B1 strains). The level of pre-mortem clinical suspicion was low (7/17, 41%), and 7/17 patients (41%) died within the first 72 hours of admission. Cryptococcosis was responsible for a significant proportion of AIDS-related mortality. The clinical diagnosis and patient management were inadequate, supporting the need for cryptococcal screening for early detection of the disease.

Related details of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV were extracted and analyzed by standard statistical methods. RESULTS: A total of 107 cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths (overall case fatality rate (CFR), 16.8%; male-specific CFR was 17.5% [14/80] and female-specific CFR was 14.8% [4/27]) were reported to WHO from the National International Health Regulation Focal Points of Saudi Arabia and Oman. The overall mean age was 50\u00B117 years and 80 patients (74.8%) were male. The average time from the onset of the symptoms to the first hospitalization was 3\u00B13.3 days; from the first hospitalization to laboratory confirmation was 3.6\u00B16.5 days; from the onset of symptom to death was 17.5\u00B111.7 days; and the mean length of hospitalization for patients with MERS-CoV was 3.5\u00B13.9 days.

Methods: Viral RNA was extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29 2019-nCoV genomes and 30 \u03B2-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank. Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were identified by Wuhan\u0027s or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13 with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity (92.87%), suggesting that S gene was of a faster evolutionary rate. The genome sequence similarities among 29 strains from China (Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen), Japan, USA, and Finland, were all more than 99.9%; however, some single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in some strains. Conclusion: The genome of Hangzhou 2019-nCoV strain was very close to the genomes of strains from other cities in China and overseas collected at early epidemic phase.

Previously reported non quantitative multiplex real-time PCR techniques based on intercalating dyes were conducted once the PCR is completed by performing melting curve analysis (MCA). The technique presented in this paper is both qualitative and quantitative as it provides information about the presence of multiple DNA strands as well as the number of starting copies in the tested sample. Besides important internal control, multiplex qPCR also allows detecting concentrations of more than one DNA strand within the same sample.

Some of the unique characteristics in the replication of coronaviruses include generation of a 3\u0027 coterminal-nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs, each of which appears to direct the synthesis of one protein. Two virus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified. Many of the distinctive features of coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced diseases may result from the properties of the two coronavirus glycoproteins. The intracellular budding site, which may be important in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections, appears to be due to the restricted intracytoplasmic migration of the E1 glycoprotein, which acts as a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein. E1 also exhibits distinctive behavior by self-aggregating on heating at 100\u00B0C in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and by its interaction with RNA in the viral nucleocapsid. The E1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an O-linked glycoprotein, unlike most other viral glycoproteins. Thus, the coronavirus system may be a useful model for the study of synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of O-linked cellular glycoproteins.","publish_time":"1983-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sturman, Lawrence S.; Holmes, Kathryn V.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45d70772bdf3ab4faa9fe6085aa92fb35af5b109.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352708607216; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352708607216","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus glycoproteins","E1 glycoprotein","coronavirus system","viral glycoproteins","O-linked glycoprotein","distinctive features of coronavirus infection","distinctive behavior","coronavirus-induced diseases","transmembrane glycoprotein","cellular glycoproteins","E1 of mouse hepatitis virus","distinctive replicative cycle","transport of O","replication of coronaviruses","study of synthesis","viral nucleocapsid","virus-specific RNA polymerase activities","important group of animal","Publisher Summary Coronaviruses","human pathogens","heating","MHV","SDS","self-aggregating","useful model","sodium dodecyl sulfate","establishment","interaction","glycosylation","restricted intracytoplasmic migration","properties","coterminal-nested set","maintenance of persistent infections","generation","unique characteristics","matrix","intracellular budding site","subgenomic mRNAs"],"language":"en"},

When produced as fusions with convenient tags, they become reagents which pair their selective binding capacity to an orthogonal function. Several kinds of immunoreagents composed by nanobodies and either large proteins or short sequences have been designed for providing inexpensive ready-to-use biological tools. The possibility to choose among alternative expression strategies is critical because the fusion moieties might require specific conditions for correct folding or post-translational modifications. In the case of nanobody production, the trend is towards simpler but reliable (bacterial) methods that can substitute for more cumbersome processes requiring the use of eukaryotic systems. The use of these will not disappear, but will be restricted to those cases in which the final immunoconstructs must have features that cannot be obtained in prokaryotic cells. At the same time, bacterial expression has evolved from the conventional procedure which considered exclusively the nanobody and nanobody-fusion accumulation in the periplasm. Several reports show the advantage of cytoplasmic expression, surface-display and secretion for at least some applications. Finally, there is an increasing interest to use as a model the short nanobody sequence for the development of in silico methodologies aimed at optimizing the yields, stability and affinity of recombinant antibodies.","publish_time":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Marco, Ario","journal":"Protein Expression and Purification","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de037030aa8aa8215e685b2f8aaaf50a47f947ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151424.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592820301650; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2020.105645; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046592820301650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial expression","short nanobody sequence","use of eukaryotic systems","nanobody-fusion accumulation","alternative expression strategies","advantage of cytoplasmic expression","case of nanobody production","prokaryotic systems","fusion moieties","short sequences","prokaryotic cells","correct folding","specific conditions","straightforward engineering","yields","selective binding capacity","post-translational modifications","nanobodies","trend","surface-display","development","large proteins","stability","orthogonal function","methods","secretion","cumbersome processes","model","affinity of recombinant antibodies","silico methodologies","conventional procedure","Abstract Antibody fragments","convenient tags","reports","possibility","periplasm","biological tools","kinds of immunoreagents","final","fusions","applications","features","time","cases"],"language":"en"},

Improved characterization of specific respiratory pathogens by identifying frequent signs, symptoms and demographic characteristics, along with improving our understanding of coinfection rates and seasonality, may improve treatment and prevention measures. METHODS: Febrile respiratory illness (FRI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance was conducted from October 2011 through March 2013 among three US populations: civilians near the US\u2013Mexico border, Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries, and military recruits. Clinical and demographic questionnaire data and respiratory swabs were collected from participants, tested by PCR for nine different respiratory pathogens and summarized. Age stratified characteristics of civilians positive for influenza and recruits positive for rhinovirus were compared to other and no/unknown pathogen. Seasonality and coinfection rates were also described. RESULTS: A total of 1444 patients met the FRI or SARI case definition and were enrolled in this study. Influenza signs and symptoms varied across age groups of civilians. Recruits with rhinovirus had higher percentages of pneumonia, cough, shortness of breath, congestion, cough, less fever and longer time to seeking care and were more likely to be male compared to those in the no/unknown pathogen group. Coinfections were found in 6% of all FRI/SARI cases tested and were most frequently seen among children and with rhinovirus infections. Clear seasonal trends were identified for influenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSIONS: The age-stratified clinical characteristics associated with influenza suggest that age-specific case definitions may improve influenza surveillance and identification. Improving identification of rhinoviruses, the most frequent respiratory infection among recruits, may be useful for separating out contagious individuals, especially when larger outbreaks occur. Overall, describing the epidemiology of pathogen specific respiratory diseases can help improve clinical diagnoses, establish baselines of infection, identify outbreaks, and help prioritize the development of new vaccines and treatments.","publish_time":"2014-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radin, Jennifer M.; Hawksworth, Anthony W.; Kammerer, Peter E.; Balansay, Melinda; Raman, Rema; Lindsay, Suzanne P.; Brice, Gary T.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cbd54dab5ad14f6d8c5ad9fb9bc223cb4431ba3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4280218.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0114871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","respiratory swabs","frequent respiratory infection","different respiratory pathogens","Febrile respiratory illness","respiratory syncytial virus","severe acute respiratory infection","Influenza signs","influenza surveillance","epidemiology of pathogen specific respiratory diseases","Improved characterization of specific respiratory pathogens","clinical characteristics","rhinovirus infections","Age stratified characteristics of civilians positive","age groups of civilians","age-specific case definitions","demographic characteristics","military recruits","cough","frequent signs","symptoms","baselines of infection","clinical diagnoses","seasonality","SARI case definition","help","SARI cases","unknown pathogen group","understanding of coinfection rates","US populations","larger outbreaks","identification of rhinoviruses","demographic questionnaire data","DoD","Department of Defense","higher percentages of pneumonia","shortness of breath","Mexico border","fever","beneficiaries","congestion","Diagnostic tests","development of new vaccines","care","contagious individuals","longer time","patients","PCR","BACKGROUND","Clear seasonal trends","treatments","METHODS","participants","prevention measures","RESULTS","total","children","CONCLUSIONS","male","study","Coinfections"],"language":"en"},

This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10 %. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 \u00B5M, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 \u00B5M, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 hours after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 \u00B5M), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 \u00B5M at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klimke, A.; Hefner, G.; Will, B.; Voss, U.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185016.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720307076; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720307076?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u00B5M","treatment of SARS","treatment of severe cases","alveolar target cells","infected cells","SARS-CoV","infection of alveolar epithelial cells","alveolar surface","use of HCQ","CoV pneumonia","surface ACE2","efficient pharmacological treatment","ACE2 receptor","major problems of oral treatment","Covid","potent inhibitors of SARS","week aerosol application","effects","oral application","infections","inhalation","lung imaging findings","terminal glycosylation of ACE2","low-dose non-systemic aerosol","promotion of virus","antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate","broader use","dose estimation","elderly patients","pharmacological standpoint","infected person","inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia","new coronavirus disease","significant change of cell","sufficient therapeutic levels","adverse drug reactions","metabolism","spleen","accumulation","disappearance","intestinal resorption","negative conversion","hepatic","tolerability","viral load reduction","order","self-medication","liver","prevention","hydroxychloroquine","EC50","times","clinical trial","inconsistent individual bioavailability","need","increase","central function","high concentration","respiratory illness","prophylactic effect","toxicity","advantage","Empirical data","controls","hours","authors","dosage","inhibition","lethality ranges","addition"],"language":"en"},

The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Yuxin; Shin, Woo In; Pang, Yoong Xin; Meng, Yang; Lai, Jianchen; You, Chong; Zhao, Haitao; Lester, Edward; Wu, Tao; Pang, Cheng Heng","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d344ccb7f1b5c4f6be838aa548b04c5e5e57d5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177691.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235575/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["outbreak","zoonotic SARS-CoV","bat coronavirus","recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","reported case of coronavirus disease","human","member of enveloped RNA coronavirus","various medical treatment approaches","various levels","various governments","confirmed cases","China","review","infected bats","infected patients","days","combined antiviral treatment","current mortality rate","basis of current studies","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe impacts","recent advances","statistical studies","highest success rate","continuous global effort","social health","economy","unprepared world","fatalities","MERS","incubation period","overall genome sequence","festive season","series of containment measures","BatCoV RaTG13","COVID","average","total","strategies","different countries","paper","prevention","nCoV","Wuhan","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Many discourses and practices surrounding hospitals\u2019 new investments in information and communication technologies tend to revolve around security provision. Oftentimes, however, scenarios of extreme and exceptional circumstances are used to justify the implementation of identification and tracking technologies that may be more about managerial control than patient care. Drawing upon qualitative research in 23 U.S. hospitals from 2007 to 2009, our analysis focuses on hospitals\u2019 deployment of identification and location technologies that manage patients, track personnel, and generate data in real-time. These systems are framed as aiding in the process of managing supplies and medications for pandemic flu outbreaks, monitoring exposure patterns for infectious diseases, and helping triage or manage the location and condition of patients during mass casualty disasters. We show that in spite of the framing of security and emergency preparedness, these technologies are primarily managerial tools for hospital administrators. Just as systems can be used to track infection vectors, those same systems can be used on a daily basis to monitor the workflow of hospital personnel, including nurses, physicians, and custodial staff, and to discipline or reward according to performance. In other words, the biosecuritization modality of the technological imperative leads to the framing of medical progress as the \u201Crationalization\u201D of organizations through technological monitoring, which is intended to promote accountability and new forms of responsibilization of healthcare workers.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisher, Jill A.; Monahan, Torin","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/798c10946a8273699ff37c6717aefff5ec893c70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130908.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953610008014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21163565/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953610008014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.11.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["location technologies","systems","communication technologies","tracking technologies","technological monitoring","hospitals\u2019 new investments","new instantiations","technological imperative leads","framing of security","track personnel","new forms of responsibilization","hospitals\u2019 deployment of identification","workflow of hospital personnel","condition of patients","biosecuritization modality","managerial tools","implementation of identification","managerial control","hospital administrators","healthcare workers","security provision","framing of medical progress","pandemic flu outbreaks","supplies","exposure patterns","nurses","information","medications","physicians","rationalization","practices","infectious diseases","emergency preparedness","mass casualty disasters","triage","discourses","exceptional circumstances","custodial staff","scenarios of extreme","process","patient care","daily basis","aiding","accountability","data","analysis","organizations","infection vectors","qualitative research","reward","paper","concept","words"],"language":"en"},

PEDV strains with variants in the spike (S) gene have been reported in several countries. To better understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates, in this study, we characterised the complete genome sequence of a novel PEDV variant JSCZ1601 from a outbreak in China in 2016. The PEDV isolate was 28,033 nucleotides (nt) in length without the polyadenylated sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome sequence of JSCZ1601 grouped it with the pandemic variants determined post-2010 into group 2 (G2). However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a new subgroup separated from the subgroups containing the other G2 strains. Comparative analysis of the amino acids encoded by the S genes revealed the N-terminal of the deduced JSCZ1601 S protein had a novel two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with all identified genogroups. Further, compared with the reference strains, a \u2018G\u2019 insertion was detected in the 5\u2032 terminal of the 5\u2032UTR of the JSCZ1601. The animal experiment revealed that this strain was high pathogenic to neonatal pigs. Taken together, a PEDV strain with the new molecular characterizations and phylogenies was found in mainland China. It is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of PEDV variations.","publish_time":"2017-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Baochao; Jiao, Dian; Zhao, Xiaona; Pang, Fengjiao; Xiao, Qi; Yu, Zhengyu; Mao, Aihua; Guo, Rongli; Yuan, Wanzhe; Zhao, Pandeng; He, Kongwang; Li, Bin","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7360f5cfdd468aea794a9eb68291950862c8fcb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5343579.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep44209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28276526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PEDV strains","PEDV isolate","novel PEDV variant JSCZ1601","S gene of JSCZ1601","monitoring of PEDV variations","deduced JSCZ1601 S protein","full-length genome sequence of JSCZ1601","S genes","G2 strains","genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates","reference strains","complete genome sequence","new molecular characterizations","amino acids","molecular epidemiology","new subgroup","N-terminal","pandemic variants","Comparative analysis","Phylogenetic analysis","mainland China","amino-acid deletion","great economic losses","S59","Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","phylogenies","study","global pig industry","spike","neonatal pigs","N58","nucleotides","subgroups","polyadenylated sequences","animal experiment","identified genogroups","insertion","UTR","countries"],"language":"en"},

The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2=0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Al-Khlaiwi, Thamir; Usmani, Adnan Mahmood; Meo, Anusha Sultan; Klonoff, David C.; Hoang, Thanh D.","journal":"J King Saud Univ Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69e44f167632170c36429e5f7d76bedac831ee9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144605.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2020.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292261/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018364720301518?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1018364720301518","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information","ISI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mortality rate","mortality outbreak trends","novel coronavirus COVID","global outbreak of COVID","mortality risk estimates","outbreaks of novel coronavirus","mutable prevalence","rising trends","mean growth rate index","global health officials","epidemiological trends","infection outbreaks","rising number of cases","global scientific journals","international health system","total number of cases","World Health Organization","large number of people","infections","enhanced public health mediations","Institute of Scientific Information","research documents","Disease Control","research institutes","good hygienic conditions","Pub Med","social distancing","major threat","transmission","movement limitations","CDC","Prevention","Worldometer","Web of Science","priority measures","male gender","Centers","economy","positive association","emerging pathogen","results","data","deaths","R2","years of age","globe","study","epidemics","period"],"language":"en"},

The present study describes the detection and detailed genetic characterization of the GI-23 viruses in Poland. The full-length genome of gammaCoV/Ck/Poland/G052/2016 strain consists of 27596 nucleotides and has typical organization for IBV (UTR5\u2032-POl-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-UTR3\u2032). The phylogenetic analysis of the complete sequence showed that it formed separate branch distinct from all of the full-length genome sequences analyzed in this study. Recombination analyses with other gammacoronaviruses revealed that Polish GI-23 strain may originate from recombination events and potential donors of build-in sequences are IBV of GI-1, GI-13 and G-19 lineages (Mass-, 793B- and QX-like strains, respectively). The 1a, 1b and N genes were involved in these recombination events.

Methods Unstable bradycardic patients who failed to respond to a fluid bolus and up to 3mg atropine were enrolled. The intervention was dopamine or TCP with crossover to dopamine if TCP failed. The primary outcome was survival to discharge or 30 days. Randomization compliance, safety, follow-up rates, primary outcome, and sample size requirements were assessed. Results Of 383 patients with unstable bradycardia, 151 (39%) failed to respond to atropine or fluid and were eligible for enrolment and 82 (55%) were correctly enrolled. Fifty-five (36%) of eligible patients could not be enrolled for practical reasons; 3 had advance directives, 32 met inclusion criteria on arrival at hospital and in 20 cases, paramedics chose not to enroll based on the circumstances of the case. The remaining 13 were missed cases; 8 were missing randomization envelopes and in 5, the paramedic forgot. Randomization compliance was 95% (78/82). Forty-two (51%) patients were randomized to TCP and seven of these crossed over to dopamine. Two cases were randomized but did not receive the intervention; either due to lack of time or loss of IV access. Three adverse events occurred in each group. Survival to discharge or 30 days in hospital was 70% (28/40) and 69% (29/42) in the dopamine and TCP groups, respectively with 100% follow up. To detect a 10% relative difference in 30 days survival between treatment arms, a sample size of 690 per group would be required.

In this study, we investigated the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonize the transcriptional activation of antiviral response elements. METHODS: HCoV-OC43 structural (membrane M and nucleocapsid N) and accessory proteins (ns2a and ns5a) were expressed individually in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells. The transcriptional activation of antiviral response elements was assessed by measuring the levels of firefly luciferase expressed under the control of interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE), IFN-\u03B2 promoter, or nuclear factor kappa B response element (NF-\u03BAB-RE). The antiviral gene expression profile in HEK-293 cells was determined by PCR array. RESULTS: The transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03B2 promoter, and NF-\u03BAB-RE was significantly reduced in the presence of HCoV-OC43 ns2a, ns5a, M, or N protein, following the challenge of cells with Sendai virus, IFN-\u03B1 or tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1. The expression of antiviral genes involved in the type I IFN and NF-\u03BAB signaling pathways was also downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 structural or accessory proteins. CONCLUSION: Both structural and accessory HCoV-OC43 proteins are able to inhibit antiviral response elements in HEK-293 cells, and to block the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.","publish_time":"2018-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beidas, Meshal; Chehadeh, Wassim","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7eb397ceb404d9564125387e7462df723c542d2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000490566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30041172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43 structural","accessory HCoV-OC43 proteins","OC43 ns2a","transcriptional activation of antiviral response elements","presence of HCoV","IFN-\u03B1","ability of HCoV","activation of different antiviral","IFN-\u03B2 promoter","accessory proteins","HEK","NF-\u03BAB","expression of antiviral genes","pathogenesis of human coronavirus OC43","stimulated response element","challenge of cells","antiviral gene expression profile","nuclear factor kappa B response element","transcriptional activity of ISRE","ns5a","pathways","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","nucleocapsid N","N protein","human embryonic kidney","Sendai virus","membrane","type","molecular mechanisms","control of interferon","levels of firefly luciferase","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHODS","infection","OBJECTIVES","PCR array","study"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES: For the purpose of collecting potentially eligible articles, we searched for articles in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and CNKI databases up to February 2017, using the following key words: \u201Ccorticosteroid\u201D, \u201Costeonecrosis of the femoral head\u201D, \u201Crisk factors\u201D, \u201Cdiagnosis\u201D, \u201Cprognosis\u201D, and \u201Ctreatment\u201D. STUDY SELECTION: Articles on relationships between corticosteroid and ONFH were selected for this review. Articles on the diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention of earlier-stage ONFH were also reviewed. RESULTS: The incidence of corticosteroid-induced ONFH was associated with high doses of corticosteroids, and underlying diseases in certain predisposed individuals mainly occurred in the first 3 months of corticosteroid prescription. The enhanced awareness and minimized exposure to the established risk factors and earlier definitive diagnosis are essential for the success of joint preservation. When following up patients with ONFH, treatment should be started if necessary. Surgical treatment yielded better results than conservative therapy in earlier-stage ONFH. The ideal purpose of earlier intervention and treatment is permanent preservation of the femoral head without physical restrictions in daily living. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should enhance their precaution awareness of corticosteroid-induced ONFH. For high-risk patients, regular follow-up is very important in the 1(st) year after high-dose prescription of corticosteroids. Patients with suspected ONFH should be referred to orthopedists for diagnosis and treatment in its earlier stage to preserve the joint.","publish_time":"2017-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Li-Hua; Zhang, Qing-Yu; Sun, Wei; Li, Zi-Rong; Gao, Fu-Qiang","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89d4bbbaafc5df5274e5ca4f2b21b3f27b50b216.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5678261.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/0366-6999.217094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29067959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNKI","ONFH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of corticosteroid","induced ONFH","stage ONFH","suspected ONFH","earlier stage","Surgical treatment","incidence of corticosteroid","femoral head","definitive diagnosis","precaution awareness of corticosteroid","months of corticosteroid prescription","induced osteonecrosis","eligible articles","ideal purpose of earlier intervention","high-risk patients","prognosis","review","high-dose prescription of corticosteroids","established risk factors","high doses of corticosteroids","success of joint preservation","permanent preservation","enhanced awareness","better results","following key words","underlying diseases","early detection","conservative therapy","multidisciplinary physicians","minimized exposure","current recommendation","Cochrane Library","physical restrictions","Embase","relationships","daily living","certain predisposed individuals","regular follow-up","PubMed","comprehensive analysis","orthopedists","CNKI databases","STUDY SELECTION","clinical literature","Clinicians","year","CONCLUSIONS","DATA SOURCES","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The infected host cell detects trace amounts of viral RNA and the last years have revealed common principles in the biochemical mechanisms leading to signal amplification that is required for mounting of a powerful antiviral response. Components of the RNA sensing and signaling machinery such as RIG-I-like proteins, MAVS and the inflammasome inducibly form large oligomers or even fibers that exhibit hallmarks of prions. Following a nucleation event triggered by detection of viral RNA, these energetically favorable and irreversible polymerization events trigger signaling cascades leading to the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, mediated by interferon and NF-\u03BAB pathways. Viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate these host cell signaling pathways in order to ensure their replication. We will discuss at the examples of influenza and HTLV-1 viruses how a fascinating diversity of biochemical mechanisms is employed by viral proteins to control the NF-\u03BAB pathway at all levels.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmitz, M.

Here, we report structure-based designs of Ebola and Marburg GP trimers based on a stabilizing mutation in the hinge loop in refolding region 1 and substitution of a partially buried charge at the interface of the GP1 and GP2 subunits. The combined substitutions (T577P and K588F) substantially increased trimer expression for Ebola GP proteins.

The purpose of this study was to determine factors contributing to variability in our murine model of small bowel resection (SBR). METHODS: Male C57Bl/6 mice were randomized to sham or 50% SBR. The effect of housing type (pathogen-free versus standard housing), nutrition (reconstituted powder versus tube feeding formulation), and correlates of intestinal morphology with gene expression changes were investigated Multiple linear regression modeling or one-way ANOVA was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Pathogen-free mice had significantly shorter ileal villi at baseline and demonstrated greater villus growth after SBR compared to mice housed in standard rooms. Food type did not affect adaptation. Gene expression changes were more consistent and significant in isolated crypt cells that demonstrated adaptive growth when compared with crypts that did not deepen after SBR. CONCLUSION: Maintenance of mice in pathogen-free conditions and restricting gene expression analysis to individual animals exhibiting morphologic adaptation enhances sensitivity and specificity of data derived from this model. These refinements will minimize experimental variability and lead to improved understanding of the complex process of intestinal adaptation.","publish_time":"2008-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Janice A.; Martin, Colin A.; Nair, Rajalakshmi; Guo, Jun; Erwin, Christopher R.; Warner, Brad W.","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e832a29a201ac7756e7c307e33d9fe9492e369f4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8b2d07f60391054a3a923959c8f842144436825c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2481288.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346808001620; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.02.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18558176/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2481288?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022346808001620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SBR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SBR","Pathogen-free mice","gene expression changes","gene expression analysis","Maintenance of mice","data analysis","pathogen-free conditions","morphologic adaptation","standard housing","specificity of data","reproducible data","PURPOSE","complex process of intestinal adaptation","effect of housing type","adaptive growth","experimental variability","standard rooms","Food type","murine model of small bowel resection","greater villus growth","correlates of intestinal morphology","use of murine models of disease","Multiple linear regression modeling","one-way ANOVA","individual animals","improved understanding","shorter ileal villi","lead","isolated crypt cells","baseline","sensitivity","nutrition","reconstituted powder","tube","formulation","refinements","METHODS","Male C57Bl","factors","crypts","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","study","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

It is an approved medicinal product in more than 50 countries for the treatment of airway infections such as acute bronchitis, common cold, and sinusitis. PURPOSE: While the pharmacological effects of EPs(\u00AE) 7630 have extensively been evaluated in diverse in vitro test systems, the number of publications reporting results from in vivo models is limited. STUDY DESIGN: In the present study antitussive, secretolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects of EPs(\u00AE) 7630 were assessed in animal experiments following oral administration at human equivalent doses. METHODS: Antitussive effects were evaluated using ammonia- and citric acid-induced models of cough in mice (20, 40, 120 mg/kg) and guinea pigs (10, 20, 45 mg/kg), respectively. For the determination of secretolytic activity tracheobronchial secretion of intraperitoneally injected phenol red was determined in mice, while antiinflammatory action was assessed in an acute bacterial bronchitis model in rats. RESULTS: A significant and dose-dependent reduction of cough frequency was observed in both cough models, which was accompanied by a prolongation of cough latency time. Similarly, the extract exerted a marked secretolytic activity in mice. Induction of acute bacterial bronchitis caused characteristic histopathological changes in lung tissue adjacent to trachea and bronchi. The degree of these lesions was significantly reduced in rats treated with EPs(\u00AE) 7630 at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg. This protective effect at least partially seems to be mediated by an up-regulation of superoxide dismutase and a subsequent protective effect against oxidative stress as indicated by a reduced serum level of malondialdehyde. CONCLUSION: The present data further support the therapeutic use of EPs(\u00AE) 7630 in respiratory tract infections and provide a basis for detailed studies on its bioactive constituents as well as their in vivo mode of action.","publish_time":"2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bao, Yanyan; Gao, Yingjie; Koch, Egon; Pan, Xin; Jin, Yahong; Cui, Xiaolan","journal":"Phytomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172309.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711315000707; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2015.03.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711315000707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cough models","acute bronchitis","mice","anti-inflammatory effects of EPs","pharmacological effects of EPs","tissue-protective activity","Antitussive effects","marked secretolytic activity","therapeutic use of EPs","Induction of acute bacterial bronchitis","acute bacterial bronchitis model","present study antitussive","citric acid-induced models of cough","subsequent protective effect","rats","results","determination of secretolytic activity tracheobronchial secretion","prolongation of cough latency time","dose-dependent reduction of cough frequency","present data","STUDY DESIGN","antiinflammatory action","mode of action","lung tissue adjacent","treatment of airway infections","respiratory tract infections","human equivalent doses","proprietary aqueous-ethanolic extract","reduced serum level of malondialdehyde","characteristic histopathological changes","basis","oral administration","injected phenol red","antioxidant","oxidative stress","roots of Pelargonium sidoides DC","countries","trachea","number of publications","ammonia","animal experiments","detailed studies","regulation of superoxide dismutase","bioactive constituents","test systems","antiviral","sinusitis","approved medicinal product","lesions","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","METHODS","guinea pigs","degree","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The lack of a clear human epidemic suggests that the basic reproductive number R0 is below or very close to one for all three infections. However, robust cluster-based estimates for low R0 values are still desirable so as to help prioritise scarce resources between different emerging infections and to detect significant changes between clusters and over time. We developed an inferential transmission model capable of distinguishing the signal of human-to-human transmission from the background noise of direct spillover transmission (e.g. from markets or farms). By simulation, we showed that our approach could obtain unbiased estimates of R0, even when the temporal trend in spillover exposure was not fully known, so long as the serial interval of the infection and the timing of a sudden drop in spillover exposure were known (e.g. day of market closure). Applying our method to data from the three largest outbreaks of influenza A/H7N9 outbreak in China in 2013, we found evidence that human-to-human transmission accounted for 13% (95% credible interval 1%\u201332%) of cases overall. We estimated R0 for the three clusters to be: 0.19 in Shanghai (0.01-0.49), 0.29 in Jiangsu (0.03-0.73); and 0.03 in Zhejiang (0.00-0.22). If a reliable temporal trend for the spillover hazard could be estimated, for example by implementing widespread routine sampling in sentinel markets, it should be possible to estimate sub-critical values of R0 even more accurately. Should a similar strain emerge with R0\u003E1, these methods could give a real-time indication that sustained transmission is occurring with well-characterised uncertainty.","publish_time":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kucharski, Adam; Mills, Harriet; Pinsent, Amy; Fraser, Christophe; Van Kerkhove, Maria; Donnelly, Christl A.; Riley, Steven","journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3946006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619563/; https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.e1473d9bfc99d080ca242139a06c455f","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["human transmission","signal of human","spillover exposure","sporadic clusters of spillover human cases","spillover hazard","low R0 values","unbiased estimates of R0","clear human epidemic","background noise of direct spillover transmission","sub-critical values of R0","basic reproductive number R0","inferential transmission model capable","largest outbreaks of influenza","reliable temporal trend","sentinel markets","H7N9 outbreak","serial interval","credible interval","different emerging infections","robust cluster-based estimates","significant changes","widespread routine sampling","timing","scarce resources","sudden drop","animal reservoirs","example","China","approach","H5N1","MERS-CoV","data","well-characterised uncertainty","real-time indication","methods","lack","evidence","day of market closure","Pathogens","similar strain","farms","simulation","Shanghai","Jiangsu","Zhejiang"],"language":"en"},

Methods A total of 217 children were followed prospectively from birth to age 13 years. The etiology and timing of viral wheezing illnesses during the first 3 years of life were assessed along with patterns of allergen sensitization. The associations between viral wheezing illnesses, presence and pattern of aeroallergen sensitization, and asthma diagnosis at age 13 years were evaluated. Results When adjusted for all viral etiologies, wheezing with RV (odds ratio = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.1), but not respiratory syncytial virus (odds ratio = 1.0; 95% CI, 0.4-2.3), was associated with asthma at age 13 years. Age of aeroallergen sensitization also influenced asthma risk; 65% of children sensitized by age 1 year had asthma at age 13 years, compared with 40% of children not sensitized at age 1 year but sensitized by age 5 years, and 17% of children not sensitized at age 5 years.

Conclusions In a high-risk birth cohort, the persistence of asthma at age 13 years was most strongly associated with outpatient wheezing illnesses with RV and aeroallergen sensitization in early life.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubner, Frederick J.; Jackson, Daniel J.; Evans, Michael D.; Gangnon, Ronald E.; Tisler, Christopher J.; Pappas, Tressa E.; Gern, James E.; Lemanske, Robert F.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3f288ef383d64c9a4ffd0f9cbf401fd3689b98f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5104680.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2016.03.049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674916302767; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674916302767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27312820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Age of aeroallergen sensitization","risk of asthma","asthma risk","persistence of asthma","years of life","school age","timing of aeroallergen sensitization","Early life aeroallergen sensitization","asthma diagnosis","RV wheezing","pattern of aeroallergen sensitization","timing of viral wheezing illnesses","children","specific viral illnesses","patterns of allergen sensitization","adolescence","viral etiologies","risk factors","Background Early life rhinovirus","odds ratio","high-risk birth cohort","additive effects","presence","type","respiratory syncytial virus","relationships","associations","etiology","outpatient","Conclusions","Methods","total","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Thus the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues represent an important target for vaccination. Indeed, more than 20 years of research have clearly demonstrated the benefits of mucosal vaccination versus systemic vaccination. Such benefits include local induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as well as activation and maturation of mucosal dendritic cells, homing of effector cells to the mucosal surfaces, expression of specific host defense peptides, and other innate effector molecules. In addition, mucosal vaccination offers the opportunity to induce colostral and lactogenic immunity during pregnancy and the possibility of avoiding neutralization of early life vaccines by maternal antibodies, both of which are critical for protecting the most susceptible from infectious diseases. Moreover, mucosal administration offers the advantage of inducing both effective systemic immunity and mucosal immunity, enhancing vaccine efficacy and providing improved protection. A number of animal vaccines are already administered via the mucosal surfaces, with many more to come over the next few years. It is gratifying to see that veterinary vaccine development has yet again taken a leadership role in exploring innovative approaches and technologies to mucosal vaccination. For the veterinary field, considerations for mucosal vaccine development and use necessarily include costs (often pennies per dose), mass delivery that preferably avoids animal restraint, and economic and trade considerations. In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the existing vaccine technologies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Heather L.; Gerdts, Volker; Babiuk, Lorne A.","journal":"Mucosal Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28a1d5f0ab7ef183e07269f2f70c35d8ccd9cdea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149622.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128119242000481; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128119242000481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucosal surfaces","effective mucosal immunity","mucosal administration","benefits of mucosal vaccination","mucosal vaccine development","maturation of mucosal dendritic cells","systemic vaccination","effective systemic immunity","veterinary vaccine development","lactogenic immunity","vaccine efficacy","existing vaccine technologies","induction of effective immune responses","homing of effector cells","number of animal vaccines","immune regulation","animal restraint","trade considerations","veterinary field","years of research","innate effector molecules","neutralization of early life vaccines","local induction of secretory immunoglobulin","expression of specific host defense peptides","advantage of inducing","possibility","tolerance","innovative approaches","homeostasis","opportunity","mass delivery","maternal antibodies","pregnancy","activation","colostral","lymphoid tissues","food antigens","pennies","dose","pathogens","SIgA","leadership role","important target","costs","overview","improved protection","addition","infectious diseases","disadvantages","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved.

This protective function is especially important at the time of weaning, when animals are exposed to infectious agents and to numerous stresses such as the change of environment and diet. Diets supplemented with spray-dried plasma or plasma protein fractions have been shown to improve growth performance of farm animals and have been proposed as an alternative to antibiotics. In this review, we summarize our findings on the mechanism of action of dietary plasma proteins using a rat model of intestinal inflammation, based on the administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B activates the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), increasing T-lymphocytes in Peyer\u0027s patches and the number of activated T lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes (organized GALT). In the lamina propria SEB increased cytotoxic T \u03B4\u03B3 and natural killer cell populations of the diffuse GALT. Staphyloccocal enterotoxin B significantly increased proinflammatory cytokines in Peyer\u0027s patches and mucosa. Plasma protein supplements modulated the mucosal immune response in organized and diffuse GALT, protecting GALT from possible excessive activation by the SEB challenge. These effects are accompanied by a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production, supporting the view that changes in cytokine production mediate the effects of dietary plasma proteins during intestinal inflammation. The increase in mucosal permeability and intestinal secretion induced by SEB was associated with decreased expression of mucosal tight-junction and adherent-junction proteins. Both plasma and plasma protein fractions prevented the effects of SEB on intestinal permeability, thus reducing the exposure of the host to microbial and food antigens across the interstitial space. These findings indicate that dietary plasma proteins modulate functional and structural properties of the intestinal mucosa.","publish_time":"2009-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moret\u00F3, M.; P\u00E9rez-Bosque, A.","journal":"J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109928.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820151/; https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-1381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GALT","SEB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of dietary plasma proteins","intestinal mucosa","plasma protein fractions","Plasma protein supplements","effects of SEB","intestinal permeability","diffuse GALT","organized GALT","intestinal secretion","spray-dried plasma","SEB challenge","T-lymphocytes","mucosal permeability","rat model of intestinal inflammation","adherent-junction proteins","lamina propria SEB","Staphyloccocal enterotoxin B","Staphylococcal enterotoxin B","Peyer\u0027s patches","findings","administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B","number of activated T lymphocytes","reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production","cytotoxic T \u03B4\u03B3","mucosal immune response","increased proinflammatory cytokines","decreased expression of mucosal tight-junction","chemical agents","infectious agents","growth performance of farm animals","natural killer cell populations","mesenteric lymph nodes","structural properties","gut","possible excessive activation","food antigens","changes","mechanism of action","numerous stresses","entrance of biological","host","epithelium","exposure","lymphoid tissue","homeostasis","change of environment","interstitial space","time of weaning","Diets","protective function","stability","alternative","antibiotics","system","review"],"language":"en"},

Once, neither an anti-viral drug nor an effective vaccines are available, studies on new anti-ASFV molecules are urgently need. Recently, it has been shown that ASFV type II topoisomerase (ASFV-topo II) is inhibited by several fluoroquinolones (bacterial DNA topoisomerase inhibitors), raising the idea that this viral enzyme can be a potential target for drug development against ASFV. Here, we report that genistein hampers ASFV infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations in Vero cells and porcine macrophages. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of this isoflavone, previously described as a topo II poison in eukaryotes, is maximal when it is added to cells at middle-phase of infection (8 hpi), disrupting viral DNA replication, blocking the transcription of late viral genes as well as the synthesis of late viral proteins, reducing viral progeny. Further, the single cell electrophoresis analysis revealed the presence of fragmented ASFV genomes in cells exposed to genistein, suggesting that this molecule also acts as an ASFV-topo II poison and not as a reversible inhibitor. No antiviral effects were detected when genistein was added before or at entry phase of ASFV infection. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that genistein may interact with four residues of the ATP-binding site of ASFV-topo II (Asn-144, Val-146, Gly-147 and Leu-148), showing more binding affinity (\u22124.62 kcal/mol) than ATP4\u2212 (\u22123.02 kcal/mol), emphasizing the idea that this viral enzyme has an essential role during viral genome replication and can be a good target for drug development against ASFV.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arabyan, Erik; Hakobyan, Astghik; Kotsinyan, Armen; Karalyan, Zaven; Arakelov, Vahram; Arakelov, Grigor; Nazaryan, Karen; Simonyan, Anna; Aroutiounian, Rouben; Ferreira, Fernando; Zakaryan, Hovakim","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57668f80ab3f9d3baefa122a5227c9280a20e9be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127377.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.06.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940214/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218300366; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218300366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASFV-topo","ASFV type","viral enzyme","genistein hampers ASFV infection","viral progeny","anti-viral drug","entry phase of ASFV infection","viral DNA replication","new anti-ASFV molecules","ATP-binding site of ASFV","viral genome replication","presence of fragmented ASFV genomes","transcription of late viral genes","synthesis of late viral proteins","drug development","Vero cells","poison","idea","kcal","good target","potential target","bacterial DNA topoisomerase inhibitors","binding affinity","middle-phase","antiviral activity","antiviral effects","Molecular docking studies","non-cytotoxic concentrations","effective vaccines","serious socio-economic consequences","essential role","fatal disease of domestic pigs","Abstract African swine fever virus","single cell electrophoresis analysis","hpi","porcine macrophages","affected countries","fluoroquinolones","residues","causal agent","isoflavone","eukaryotes","ATP4","Asn","Gly","Val","reversible inhibitor","Leu"],"language":"en"},

Recently, we have generated replication-competent (E3 deleted) bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) recombinants expressing significant amounts of glycoprotein D (gD) of bovine herpesvirus-1 (a DNA virus). However, attempts to express the RNA virus genes using the same strategy were not successful. In an effort to optimize the expression, we have constructed several BAV-3 recombinants carrying the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in the E3 region with or without exogenous transcription control elements. The expression studies suggest that the introduction of a 137 bp chimeric intron upstream of the HE cDNA is able to increase the level of HE gene expression. The introduction of a SV40 early promoter or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early (IE) promoter into the expression cassette changed the kinetics of the HE expression. However, the recombinant BAV-3 containing HE under the HCMV IE promoter replicated less efficiently than the wild-type BAV-3.

New IBV variants are continuously emerging, which complicates vaccination-based IB control. In this study, five IBVs were isolated from clinical samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Ontario, Canada, and subjected to detailed molecular characterization. Analysis of the spike (S)1 gene showed that these five IBVs were highly related to the Delmarva (DMV/1639) strain (~97.0% nucleotide sequence similarity) that was firstly isolated from an IB outbreak in the Delmarva peninsula, United States of America (USA), in 2011. However, the complete genomic sequence analysis showed a 93.5\u201393.7% similarity with the Connecticut (Conn) vaccine strain, suggesting that Conn-like viruses contributed to the evolution of the five Canadian IBV/DMV isolates. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence showed evidence of recombination for at least three different IBV strains, including a Conn vaccine-like strain, a 4/91 vaccine-like strain, and one strain that is yet-unidentified. The unidentified strain may have contributed the genomic regions of the S, 3, and membrane (M) genes of the five Canadian IBV/DMV isolates.

The mechanisms of viral exacerbation and remission have become of interest in the neurosciences with circumstantial evidence that some role is played by viruses in multiple sclerosis. Epidemiological data indicate that multiple sclerosis results from exposure to a virus in childhood followed by a long latency period.

Experimental evidence points to viral non\u2010structural proteins (nsPs), in particular nsP2, as the mediator of this inhibition. However, individual expression of nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 or nsP1\u20104 does not block cellular protein synthesis in BHK cells. Trans\u2010complementation of a defective SINV replicon lacking most of the coding region for nsPs by the co\u2010expression of nsP1\u20104 propitiates viral RNA replication at low levels, and inhibition of cellular translation is not observed. Exit of nuclear proteins including T\u2010cell intracellular antigen and polypyrimidine tract\u2010binding protein is clearly detected in SINV\u2010infected cells, but not upon the expression of nsPs, even when the defective replicon was complemented. Analysis of a SINV variant with a point mutation in nsP2, exhibiting defects in the shut\u2010off of host protein synthesis, indicates that both viral RNA replication and the release of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm are greatly inhibited. Furthermore, nucleoside analogues that inhibit cellular and viral RNA synthesis impede the blockade of host mRNA translation, in addition to the release of nuclear proteins. Prevention of the shut\u2010off of host mRNA translation by nucleoside analogues is not due to the inhibition of eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation, as this prevention is also observed in PKR (\u2212/\u2212) mouse embryonic fibroblasts that do not phosphorylate eIF2\u03B1 after SINV infection. Collectively, our observations are consistent with the concept that for the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis to occur, viral RNA replication must take place at control levels, leading to the release of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm.","publish_time":"2014-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanz, Miguel A.; Garc\u00EDa\u2010Moreno, Manuel; Carrasco, Luis","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3747e06a5fb251cfb724f8df218881154928993.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162411.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329362/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SINV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA synthesis","inhibition of cellular translation","inhibition of cellular protein synthesis","viral RNA replication","cellular mRNA translation","release of nuclear proteins","viral non\u2010structural proteins","host protein synthesis","SINV infection","SINV variant","defective SINV replicon","expression of nsPs","blockade of host mRNA translation","binding protein","co\u2010expression of nsP1","individual expression of nsP1","inhibition of eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","shut","particular nsP2","BHK cells","nucleoside analogues","Infection of mammalian cells","defective replicon","infected cells","cytoplasm","Prevention","low levels","control levels","cell intracellular antigen","polypyrimidine tract","addition","Sindbis virus","point mutation","coding region","place","defects","concept","Trans\u2010complementation","Experimental evidence","nsP3","mouse embryonic fibroblasts","mediator","observations","PKR","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

In the present work we show that several of the IPN proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against type I IFN induction in Atlantic salmon. Each of the five IPNV genes cloned into an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one (IPS-1) or interferon regulatory factors (IRF). This showed that preVP2, VP3 and VP5 inhibited activation of both promoters, while VP4 only antagonized activation of the IFNa1 promoter. The viral protease VP4 was the most potent inhibitor of IFN induction, apparently targeting the IRF1 and IRF3 branch of the signaling cascade. VP4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the catalytically dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter to a similar extent as wild type VP4. In contrast to the other IPNV proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 activated the IFNa1 promoter. The ability to activate the IFN response was disrupted in the mutant VP1S163A, which has lost the ability to produce dsRNA. VP1 also exhibited synergistic effects with IRF1 and IRF3 in inducing an IFNa1-dependent antiviral state in cells. Taken together these results suggest that IPNV has developed multiple IFN antagonistic properties to prevent IFN-induction by VP1 and its dsRNA genome.","publish_time":"2015-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauksund, Silje; Greiner-Tollersrud, Linn; Chang, Chia-Jung; Robertsen, B\u00F8rre","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/575282ef09006ede426caf69398dd11fd23f102a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114410.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214004936; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214004936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPN","IFN","IPNV"],"locations":["Atlantic"],"keyphrases":["Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter","IFN-induction","interferon promoter","IFN response","IPNV proteins","ability","viral protease VP4","multiple IFN antagonistic properties","antagonized activation","potent inhibitor of IFN induction","IPNV genes","VP4 antagonism","VP5 inhibited activation","farmed Atlantic salmon","wild type VP4","IFNa1-dependent antiviral state","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1","dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation","IRF1","powerful antagonistic properties","protease activity","IPN proteins","mutant VP1S163A","IRF3 branch","dsRNA genome","major viral pathogens","interferon regulatory factors","disease","promoters","similar extent","Abstract Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus","IPS","preVP2","VP3","cells","expression vector","synergistic effects","cascade","results","contrast","present work"],"language":"en"},

This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects\u2019 relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5\u201350% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It\u2019s better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Mingxiang; Shaw, Shih-Lung; Fang, Zhixiang; Cheng, Hao","journal":"ISPRS J Photogramm Remote Sens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7b02969cbba5c043ee62b09248abd5c540e40e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111340.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924271619301248; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271619301248; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relative relationships of moving objects","relative motion of moving objects","dynamic relationships of moving objects","relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects","data models of moving objects","point objects","dynamic relative motion","moving objects\u2019 relationships","absolute space","derivation of relative motions","proposed model","absolute GIS method","absolute coordinated space","relative relationship dynamic pattern matching","efficient analysis","proposed approach","gap of traditional GIS","absolute methods","geospatial information services","famous commercial GIS software","geospatial services","experimental results","scenarios","Traditional geographic information systems","geographical information science","age of big data","motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds","additional geo-computation of transformation","innovative approach","logistics","transportation engineering","essential research topic","domains of urban governance","promise","algorithms","GIScience","spatial indexing","tracker","individuals","execution times","innovation of geodatabases","cloud computing","industrials","better computational performance","function","RSMO","epidemic spreading","current GISs","crucial approaches","paper","feasibility"],"language":"en"},

However, the impact of viral infections on adult pneumonia mortality remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the effect of virus infection on pneumonia mortality among adults stratified by virus type and patient comorbidities. METHODS: This multicentre prospective study enrolled pneumonia patients aged \u226515 years from September 2011 to August 2014. Sputum samples were tested by in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Viral infection status and its effect on in-hospital mortality were examined by age group and comorbidity status. RESULTS: A total of 2617 patients were enrolled in the study and 77.8% was aged \u226565 years. 574 (21.9%) did not have comorbidities, 790 (30.2%) had chronic respiratory disease, and 1253 (47.9%) had other comorbidities. Viruses were detected in 605 (23.1%) patients. Human rhinovirus (9.8%) was the most frequently identified virus, followed by influenza A (3.9%) and respiratory syncytial virus (3.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was more frequently identified in patients with chronic respiratory disease (4.7%) than those with other comorbidities (4.2%) and without comorbidities (2.1%) (p = 0.037). The frequencies of other viruses were almost identical between the three groups. Virus detection overall was not associated with increased mortality (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.53\u20131.09). However, influenza virus A and B were associated with three-fold higher mortality in patients with chronic respiratory disease but not with other comorbidities (ARR 3.38, 95% CI 1.54\u20137.42). Intriguingly, paramyxoviruses were associated with dramatically lower mortality in patients with other comorbidities (ARR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.70) but not with chronic respiratory disease. These effects were not affected by age group. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of virus infections on pneumonia mortality varies by virus type and comorbidity status in adults.

Sia come in a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl Sia expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C infection, but had no obvious effect on influenza A infection. Sialic acids are key glycans that are involved in many different normal cellular functions, as well as being receptors for many pathogens. However, Sia come in diverse chemically modified forms. Here we examined and manipulated the expression of 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl modified Sia on cells commonly used in influenza virus and other research by engineering the enzymes that produce or remove the acetyl groups.","publish_time":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnard, Karen N.; Wasik, Brian R.; LaClair, Justin R.; Weichert, Wendy S.; Lawrence, Brynn K.; Parrish, Colin R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ad71b8a14f99f5d6c672df33f7a758939ab582a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/13bf9fe0df944c0ee0debb0d445527ad4418cc19.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/650341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sia"],"organizations":["MDCK","SIAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetyl Sia expression","O-acetyl levels","acetyl modifications","acetyl groups","total Sia","sialate O-acetylesterase gene","sialate O-acetyltransferase gene","modified forms","canine cells","influenza virus","influenza C infection","A549 cells","surfaces of cells","influenza C viruses","over-expression of CasD1","cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines","different human","receptors","variant forms","low levels","Sialic acids","knockout of SIAE","virus infections","Golgi compartment of human HEK","different normal cellular functions","CRISPR","effects","C7","C8","change","obvious effect","modest increases","previous reports","key glycans","C9 positions","Cas9 editing","research","humans","canines","variety","complex regulations","tissues","enzymes","distribution","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

It is not clear whether vimentin has a role in PCV2 infection nor how it affects PCV2 infection. In this study, the function of vimentin in PK-15 cells infected with PCV2 has been elucidated. We found that vimentin had a restrictive effect on the replication of PCV2 in PK-15 cells. Overexpression of vimentin by transferred pCAGGS-vimentin and down-regulation by the respective scrambled small interfering RNA showed that vimentin restricted the replication and virion production of PCV2. A special interaction between vimentin and PCV2 Cap protein was observed using laser confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, overexpression of vimentin could decrease NF-\u03BAB activity and increase PCV2-induced caspase-3 activity in PK-15 cells.

Although CPV is a DNA virus, its genomic substitution rate is similar to some RNA viruses. Therefore, it is important to trace the evolution of CPV to monitor the appearance of mutations that might affect vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that the VP2 genes of CPV isolated from 1979 to 2016 are divided into six groups: GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, and GVI. Amino acid mutation analysis revealed several undiscovered important mutation sites: F267Y, Y324I, and T440A. Of note, the evolutionary rate of the CPV VP2 gene from Asia and Europe decreased. Codon usage analysis showed that the VP2 gene of CPV exhibits high bias with an ENC ranging from 34.93 to 36.7. Furthermore, we demonstrate that natural selection plays a major role compared to mutation pressure driving CPV evolution. CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies on the codon usage of CPV. Here, we comprehensively studied the genetic evolution, codon usage pattern, and evolutionary characterization of the VP2 gene of CPV. The novel findings revealing the evolutionary process of CPV will greatly serve future CPV research.

Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pulmonary cancer. Although there have been some improvements in the traditional therapy of lung cancer, the outcome and prognosis of patients remain poor. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 1.8 million new cases being diagnosed each year. Precision medicine based on genetic alterations is considered a new strategy of lung cancer treatment that requires highly specific biomarkers for precision diagnosis and treatment. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) plays important roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the diagnostic value of FGL2 in lung cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the expression profile and potential functions of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma. We used the TCGA and Oncomine datasets to compare the FGL2 expression levels between lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. We utilized the GEPIA, PrognoScan and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases to analyze the relationship between FGL2 expression and the survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Then, we investigated the potential roles of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma with the TIMER database and functional enrichment analyses. We found that FGL2 expression was significantly lower in lung adenocarcinoma tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue. A high expression level of FGL2 was correlated with better prognostic outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma patients, including overall survival and progression-free survival. FGL2 was positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells, including dendritic cells, CD8(\u002B) T cells, macrophages, B cells, and CD4(\u002B) T cells, in lung adenocarcinoma. Functional enrichment analyses also showed that a high expression level of FGL2 was positively correlated with enhanced T cell activities, especially CD8(\u002B) T cell activation. Thus, we propose that high FGL2 expression, which is positively associated with enhanced antitumor activities mediated by T cells, is a beneficial marker for lung adenocarcinoma treatment outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Kai; Feng, Yanyan; Wang, Hesong; Zhao, Lu; Wang, Wei; Wang, Ting; Feng, Yuyin; Huang, Guangrui; Xu, Anlong","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14df48701b672ec768ed4fe436e82b69370520a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7075367.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32206449/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8654","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCGA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung adenocarcinoma tissue","survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients","lung adenocarcinoma treatment outcomes","high FGL2 expression","FGL2 expression levels","traditional therapy of lung cancer","new strategy of lung cancer treatment","high expression level of FGL2","T cells","better prognostic outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma patients","potential roles of FGL2","potential functions of FGL2","diagnostic value of FGL2","cancer-related deaths","expression profile","dendritic cells","B cells","leading cause of cancer","common type of pulmonary cancer","enhanced T cell activities","infiltration of immune cells","T cell activation","overall survival","CD8","prognosis of patients","functional enrichment analyses","new cases","new cancers","progression-free survival","adjacent normal tissues","enhanced antitumor activities","important roles","precision diagnosis","Precision medicine","common malignant tumor","beneficial marker","specific biomarkers","TIMER database","relationship","Kaplan-Meier plotter databases","PrognoScan","genetic alterations","macrophages","CD4","Oncomine datasets","accounting","adaptive immunity","GEPIA","protein","improvements","TCGA","year","Fibrinogen","study"],"language":"en"},

Background Influenza acquired in pregnancy can have serious sequalae for both mother and fetus. Recent studies have demonstrated that influenza vaccine in pregnancy is both safe and effective. Despite this, evidence suggests that vaccine uptake in pregnancy is suboptimal in both Australia and worldwide. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the role of midwives in the promotion and provision of antenatal influenza vaccine and, to provide a statistical and thematic description of the barriers and enablers midwives encounter. Methods This mixed method study incorporated a cross sectional on-line survey and in-depth interviews conducted with midwives, employed in urban and regional South Australia. Findings Quantitative data were available for 137 midwives and 10 midwives participated in the interviews. Recruitment for the interview phase was through the last question on the survey. Whilst all midwives indicated that education and vaccine promotion were part of their role, immunization knowledge varied between Registered Nurse/Midwives (RM/RN) 80% and Registered Midwives (RM) 48.90% (p=0.001). Quantitative data showed that only 43% of midwives felt sufficiently educated to provide the vaccine. Midwives who had received formal immunization training were more likely to recommend the vaccine 93.7% (p =0.001). Qualitative data confirmed these results and identified the lack of immunization education as a barrier to practise. Conclusion Midwives identified an immunization knowledge deficit. Midwives who had received immunization education were more likely to actively promote and provide the vaccine to pregnant women. These findings indicate the need for more immunization education of midwives in both tertiary and practice settings.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Susan Elizabeth","journal":"Women Birth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e381ce0dcf2297e0b2d44e03b0a3a6371a580926.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418653/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871519220302389?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871519220302389","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Influenza","Registered Nurse/Midwives","Registered Midwives"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["role of midwives","immunization education of midwives","Registered Midwives","Conclusion Midwives","enablers midwives encounter","vaccine promotion","lack of immunization education","vaccine uptake","provision of antenatal influenza immunization","provision of antenatal influenza vaccine","immunization knowledge deficit","pregnancy","formal immunization training","Background Influenza","Findings Quantitative data","South Australian study","Qualitative data","aim","mixed method study","regional South Australia","Registered Nurse","in-depth interviews","cross sectional on-line survey","barriers","RN","thematic description","serious sequalae","Abstract Problem","results","need","interview phase","mother","fetus","question","Methods","practice settings","evidence","Recent studies","Recruitment","pregnant women"],"language":"en"},

The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age. These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index \u226540), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to \u0022shelter in place,\u0022 quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to \u0022flatten the curve\u0022 by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Preskorn, Sheldon H","journal":"Journal of psychiatric practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421292/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pra.0000000000000475","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Europe"],"keyphrases":["COVID","human population","at-risk population","entire population","US health care system","United States population","column","risk factors","years of age","mental health care professionals","cardiovascular disease","coronavirus disease","Disease Control","intensive care unit admission","public health","comorbid medical illnesses","comorbid medical conditions","US economy","basis of comorbid medical illness","severe infection","place approach","epidemiological approach","societal damage","quarantine of high-risk individuals","US Centers","isolation of infected individuals","Prevention","shelter","mitigation strategies","date","decisions","data","race","goal","tremendous number of people","social distancing","human pathogen","small number","rational phased reduction of social restrictions","morbid obesity","good hygiene practices","immunocompromised status","significant kidney","death","orders","society","body mass index","diabetes mellitus","viable strategy","experience","China","serious adverse outcomes","substantial disruption","literature","account","months","hotspots","current crisis","stratification of exposure","liver impairment","height","analysis","guidance","time","treatment","CDC","pandemic","news reports","fatal outcome","complexities","patients","numbers","surrogate","peak","following questions","Europe","effective ways","knowledge","portion","sources","article","curve","Table","aspects","reason","vulnerable population","effective community immunity","high-risk individuals","adequate community immunity","virus","quarantine of exposed individuals","case monitoring","regions of countries","vulnerable portion","effective vaccine","vigorous monitoring","widespread testing","increased use of testing","specific criteria","active disease","addition of safe","gradual lifting of restrictions","terms","majority","outbreaks","stringent safeguards","good hygiene","natural exposure","graduated opening","antibodies","year","country"],"language":"en"},

According to the National Hazardous Waste and Healthcare Waste Disposal Facility Construction Plan, 331 modern, high-standard, centralized facilities will be built up in China in municipal level cities. Although incineration is still the main technical option for HCW disposal in China, it is expected that, especially for medium and small size facilities, non-incineration technologies will develop quickly and will soon become the main technical option. The basic management needs \u2013 both from the point of view of pollution control and final disposal \u2013 have been defined, and a system of technical and environmental standards has been formulated and implemented; however, there are still some shortages. This is particularly true when considering the best available techniques and best environmental practices developed under the Stockholm Convention, with which the present technological and managing situations are not completely compliant. In this framework, the lifecycle (from generation to final disposal of wastes) of HCW and holistic approaches (technology verification, facilities operation, environmental supervision, environmental monitoring, training system, financial mechanism, etc.) towards HCW management are the most important criteria for the sustainable and reliable management of HCW in China.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Chen; Peijun, Li; Lupi, Carlo; Yangzhao, Sun; Diandou, Xu; Qian, Feng; Shasha, Fu","journal":"Waste Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b14cea53956bc6bedf4cec3254ab8a3b5bae91e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126051.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19157834/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2008.11.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956053X08004431; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X08004431","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Persistent Organic Pollutants","HCW"],"locations":["Stockholm Convention","China"],"keyphrases":["HCW management","China","reliable management of HCW","low-standard HCW disposal facilities","facilities operation","final disposal of wastes","environmental monitoring","environmental supervision","environmental standards","centralized facilities","sustainable management of healthcare wastes","system of technical","best environmental practices","main technical option","Healthcare Waste Disposal Facility Construction Plan","small size facilities","Stockholm Convention","basic management needs","National Hazardous Waste","training system","high-standard","best available techniques","non-incineration technologies","current national situation","technology verification","holistic approaches","financial mechanism","important criteria","Persistent Organic Pollutants","point of view","pollution control","generation","field","lifecycle","account","actions","situations","recommendations","requirements","municipal level cities","paper","different areas","framework","shortages"],"language":"en"},

The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an in-clinic rapid test in the detection of CPV infection in dogs. To this end, we compared the Rapid Diagnostic Kit of Canine Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Rotavirus antigen (Quicking\u00AE) to PCR, which is considered as the most reliable diagnostic method. A total of 78 duplicated faecal samples were collected from diarrhoeic dogs. Vaccination history within a month prior to the onset of diarrhoea was reported for 12 of the sampled dogs. The rapid diagnostic test was performed in 23 of the faecal samples directly, while the rest were placed into a sterile cotton tipped swab suitable for collection and transportation of viruses (Sigma \u03A3-VCM\u00AE) and stored at \u221220\u00B0C. The sensitivity of the Quicking rapid diagnostic test compared to PCR in the total number of samples, in samples from non-vaccinated dogs and in samples tested directly after collection were 22.22% (95% CI: 13.27\u201333.57%), 26.67% (95% CI: 16.08\u201339.66%) and 76.47% (95% CI: 50.10\u201393.04%) respectively, while the specificity of the test was 100% in any case. In conclusion, negative results do not exclude parvoenteritis from the differential diagnosis, especially in dogs with early vaccination history, but a positive result almost certainly indicates CPV infection.

Even though DA rats were kept as inbred lines at different institutes and suppliers, it became obvious that the various breeding stocks differed genetically. To be able to compare the results from different linkage studies it is very import to verify the genetic background of the substrains used in those studies. We performed a genetic and phenotypic analysis of two DA substrains, DA/ZtmRhd and DA/OlaHsd, and found several genetic differences. One of the allelic differences between the DA/ZtmRhd and the DA/OlaHsd strain was located at rat chromosome 3, a 17-Mb large fragment, including the peak marker of a previously identified quantitative trait locus (QTL) for collagen-induced arthritis, Cia11. In addition, the substrains exhibited a significant difference in the susceptibility to pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) and disease severity of collagen-induced arthritis and PIA. However, by generating and testing a congenic line, we could demonstrate that phenotypic differences were not due to the contaminating fragment on chromosome 3. Nevertheless, we conclude that DA substrains show distinct genetic differences and caution should be taken when comparing arthritis data from different DA substrains.

The spike glycoprotein (S) of PEDV is the major immunogenic determinant that plays a pivotal role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV, which therefore is an ideal target for the development of subunit vaccine. In an attempt to develop a subunit vaccine for PEDV, we cloned two different fragments of S protein and expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins, namely rGST-COE and rGST-S1D, in E.coli. However, the expression of these recombinant protein antigens using a variety of expression vectors, strains, and induction conditions invariably resulted in inclusion bodies. To achieve the soluble expression of recombinant proteins, several chaperone co-expression systems were tested in this study. RESULTS: We firstly tested various chaperone co-expression systems and found that co-expression of trigger factor (TF) with recombinant proteins at 15 \u00B0C was most useful in soluble production of rGST-COE and rGST-S1D compared to GroEL-ES and DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE/GroEL-ES systems. The soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D were purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B with a yield of 7.5 mg/l and 5 mg/l, respectively. Purified proteins were detected by western blot using mouse anti-GST mAb and pig anti-PEDV immune sera. In an indirect ELISA, purified proteins showed immune reactivity with pig anti-PEDV immune sera. Finally, immunization of mice with 10 \u03BCg of purified proteins elicited highly potent serum IgG and serum neutralizing antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, soluble production of recombinant spike protein of PEDV, rGST-COE and rGST-S1D, were achieved by using TF chaperone co-expression system. Our results suggest that soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D produced by co-expressing chaperones may have the potential to be used as subunit vaccine antigens.

Here, we studied the priming of SARS-CoV S by elastase and show an important role for residue Thr(795) in the S2 domain. A series of alanine mutants were generated in the vicinity of the S2 cleavage site, with the goal of examining elastase-mediated cleavage within S2.

We propose a novel mechanism whereby SARS-CoV fusion protein function can be controlled by spatial regulation of the proteolytic priming site, with important implications for viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belouzard, Sandrine; Madu, Ikenna; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"J Biol Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9e9e47667e6630156203fe938e7afb876583934.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2906266.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m110.103275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteolytic cleavage","S2 cleavage site","S2 domain","proteolytic priming site","priming of SARS","fusion activation","cleavage site position","elastase-mediated cleavage","S2 boundary","SARS-CoV S","SARS-CoV fusion protein function","fusion peptide","activation of membrane fusion","important implications","important role","viral pathogenesis","viral glycoproteins","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein","goal","spatial regulation","vicinity","S1","variety of host cell proteases","common method","novel mechanism","residue Thr","series of alanine mutants"],"language":"en"},

Severe outbreaks of PEDV variants have re-emerged in Asia and North America since 2010, causing tremendous economic losses to the swine industry. The lack of effective therapeutic treatment promotes the research for new antivirals. Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been reported as a potential antiviral drug for certain viruses. In this study, the antiviral effect of LiCl on PEDV in Vero cells was evaluated. Real-time quantitative PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that LiCl effectively inhibited the entry and replication of PEDV in Vero cells. The expression of viral RNA and protein of PEDV in Vero cells was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by LiCl. Moreover, addition of LiCl inhibited both early and late cell apoptosis induced by PEDV. Our data implied that LiCl could be a potential antiviral drug against PEDV infection. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral effect of lithium chloride on PEDV infection in vivo.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hong-jie; Gao, Dong-sheng; Li, Yong-tao; Wang, Yong-sheng; Liu, Hong-ying; Zhao, Jun","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2144e51e8ee97ba0715d6e50306dd786daa63e79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111825.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29547727/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.03.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881730961X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452881730961X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Asia","North America"],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","protein of PEDV","replication of PEDV","antiviral effect of LiCl","addition of LiCl","Vero cells","Severe outbreaks of PEDV variants","potential antiviral drug","antiviral effect of lithium chloride","acute diarrhea","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","indirect immunofluorescence assay","research","tremendous economic losses","high mortality rates","Real-time quantitative PCR","dehydration","lack of effective therapeutic treatment","late cell apoptosis","swine industry","neonatal piglets","North America","Coronaviridae family","expression of viral RNA","Asia","member","certain viruses","entry","dose-dependent manner","new antivirals","study","studies","data"],"language":"en"},

The aerosol particles were captured and removed from the air by rain and the concentration of aerosol particles significantly decreased after rain events. Therefore, rain is regarded as having a good effect on air environments in terms of the respiratory health of the general public. However, humid environments produced by long-term rain events such a monsoon may be a sufficient condition for the growth of microorganisms and vibrations because of the splashing of droplets may facilitate the aerosolization of ground microorganisms. We therefore hypothesize that the rain may increase concentrations of bioaerosols in outdoor air environments, thereby possibly influencing respiratory diseases. To verify this hypothesis, at the initial stepwise approach, we measured the concentration of airborne biological particles before, after, and during rain in a monsoon season. The measurement data of the concentration of fungal particles and bacterial particles show quantitatively that the bioaerosol concentrations during the rain event are several times higher than the concentration of the bioaerosols in the condition of no rain.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heo, Ki Joon; Kim, Hannah Bae; Lee, Byung Uk","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2fd219830f1ebab40d6e9de656aa7fa07bbd4d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094607.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226125/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2014.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850214001098; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850214001098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Rain","concentration of aerosol particles","long-term rain events","concentration of fungal particles","bacterial particles","outdoor air environments","concentration of airborne biological particles","humid environments","concentrations of bioaerosols","respiratory health","bioaerosol concentrations","growth of microorganisms","sufficient condition","respiratory diseases","monsoon season","aerosolization of ground microorganisms","terms","times higher","good effect","splashing of droplets","vibrations","initial stepwise approach","measurement data","hypothesis","general public"],"language":"en"},

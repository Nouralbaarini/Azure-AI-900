The goal of this study was to elucidate the impact of MP on eosinophil-related hyper-reactive amplification in atopic children. METHODS: We studied 48 patients with MP (26 atopic, 22 non-atopic), between 3 and 12 years of age. Serial changes in blood eosinophil counts, serum interleukin-5 (IL-5), and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were measured in atopic and non-atopic children with MP upon admission, recovery, and at 2 months post-recovery. Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; eosinophil counts were measured using an autoanalyzer. RESULTS: Serial changes in serum IL-5, ECP, and total eosinophil counts were significantly higher in atopic patients, relative to non-atopic controls (P\u22640.001). Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were significantly higher in atopic patients at all three time points tested, while eosinophil counts were higher in the clinical recovery and follow-up phases, but not in the acute phase. Furthermore, among atopic patients, serum ECP levels were significantly higher in the recovery and follow-up phases than in the acute phase. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated significant differences in eosinophil counts, serum IL-5, and serum ECP levels between atopic and non-atopic children with MP at admission, recovery, and 2 months after clinical recovery. These outcomes are suggestive of eosinophil-related hyperreactivity in atopic children, with this status maintained for at least 2 months after MP.","publish_time":"2014-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Joo-Hwa; Cho, Tae-shik; Moon, Jin-Hwa; Kim, Chang-Ryul; Oh, Jae-Won","journal":"Allergy Asthma Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae9cfa99ecf7504fba178b22f3a5635d31dd4a9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4161684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229000/; https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2014.6.5.428","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mycoplasma"],"organizations":["ECP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["atopic patients","non-atopic children","Serum IL","serum ECP levels","non-atopic controls","blood eosinophil counts","total eosinophil counts","suggestive of eosinophil","serum eosinophil cationic protein","serum interleukin","clinical recovery","impact of MP","months post-recovery","eosinophil-related hyper-reactive amplification","admission","follow-up phases","Serial changes","acute phase","related hyperreactivity","present study","significant differences","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","time points","PURPOSE","Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia","RESULTS","timing","CONCLUSIONS","exacerbation","outcomes","status","onset of asthma","autoanalyzer","years of age","goal","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Cholesterol depletion by pretreatment of Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells with a cholesterol-sequestering drug methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD), inhibited the production of BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was partially reversed by cholesterol replenishment, indicating that the reduction was caused by cholesterol depletion. Cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage only had a mild effect on the virus production. However, cell membrane cholesterol depletion did not reduce the virus attachment. In addition, treatment of BoHV-1 particles with M\u03B2CD also reduced the virus infectivity significantly and the effect was partially reversed by addition of exogenous cholesterol. Taken together, these data implicated that cell membrane cholesterol mainly contributed to BoHV-1 entry into MDBK cells and the viral envelope cholesterol was also essential for the virus infectivity.","publish_time":"2010-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Liqian; Ding, Xiuyan; Tao, Jie; Wang, Jianye; Zhao, Xin; Zhu, Guoqiang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62d8d4b899c21625ecd7decbed3d3a548a23ed1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117431.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.12.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20097021/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113510000027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113510000027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDBK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cholesterol replenishment","role of cholesterol","Abstract Cholesterol","cell membrane cholesterol depletion","viral envelope cholesterol","addition of exogenous cholesterol","cholesterol-sequestering drug methyl-\u03B2","production of BoHV","virus infectivity","virus production","treatment of BoHV","virus attachment","target cell membrane","MDBK cells","mild effect","M\u03B2CD","inhibitory effect","Darby bovine kidney","bovine herpesvirus type","post-entry stage","pretreatment of Madin","cyclodextrin","particles","reduction","life cycle","data","dose-dependent manner","viruses","infection"],"language":"en"},

Using extensive simulations, we find that contact heterogeneity can have a strong effect on how the structure of genealogies reflects epidemiologically relevant quantities such as the proportion of a population that is infected. Comparing the simulations to BEAST reconstructions, we also find that contact heterogeneity can increase the number of sequence isolates required to estimate these quantities over the course of an epidemic. Our results suggest that data about contact-network structure will be required in addition to sequence data for accurate estimation of a parasitic agent\u0027s genealogy.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. FINDINGS: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0\u20226 (0\u20226-0\u20228)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4\u20227 (3\u20226-5\u20228)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0\u20228-1\u20224); 2\u20220 (1\u20225-2\u20229)]. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8(\u002B) T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-\u03B3 levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC=0\u202293) and neutrophil-to-CD8(\u002B) T cell ratio (N8R) (AUC =0\u202294) were identified as powerful prognostic factors affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity.

In this study, we generated a novel approximately 10-kb molecular data set of 19 nuclear exon and intron gene fragments for 40 bat species to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae. We estimated divergence times and explored potential reasons for any incongruent phylogenetic signal. We demonstrated the effects of outlier taxa and genes on phylogenetic reconstructions and compared the relative performance of intron and exon data to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analyses produced a well-resolved phylogeny, supporting the familial status of Hipposideridae and demonstrated the paraphyly of the largest genus, Hipposideros. A fossil-calibrated timetree and biogeographical analyses estimated that Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae diverged in Africa during the Eocene approximately 42 Ma. The phylogram, the timetree, and a unique retrotransposon insertion supported the elevation of the subtribe Rhinonycterina to family level and which is diagnosed herein. Comparative analysis of diversification rates showed that the speciose genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros underwent diversification during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. The intron versus exon analyses demonstrated the improved nodal support provided by introns for our optimal tree, an important finding for large-scale phylogenomic studies, which typically rely on exon data alone. With the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by a novel coronavirus, the study of these species is urgent as they are considered the natural reservoir for emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses. It has been shown that host phylogeny is the primary factor that determines a virus\u2019s persistence, replicative ability, and can act as a predictor of new emerging disease. Therefore, this newly resolved phylogeny can be used to direct future assessments of viral diversity and to elucidate the origin and development of SARS-like coronaviruses in mammals.","publish_time":"2014-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foley, Nicole M.; Thong, Vu Dinh; Soisook, Pipat; Goodman, Steven M.; Armstrong, Kyle N.; Jacobs, David S.; Puechmaille, S\u00E9bastien J.; Teeling, Emma C.","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11217ee4e2bcf58f21011db8ff3d166aad2691ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4769323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25433366/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msu329","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum"],"locations":["Africa","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Phylogenetic analyses","phylogenetic relationships","exon analyses","phylogenetic reconstructions","exon data","incongruent phylogenetic signal","nuclear exon","biogeographical analyses","taxonomic relationships","Hipposideros","familial status of Hipposideridae","families Rhinolophidae","well-resolved phylogeny","host phylogeny","study","coronaviruses","intron gene fragments","relative performance of intron","molecular data set","bat species","development of SARS","novel coronavirus","emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome","recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome","related horseshoe bats","fossil-calibrated timetree","Comparative analysis of diversification rates","Old World leaf-nosed bats","elevation","important finding","natural reservoir","potential reasons","speciose genera Rhinolophus","improved nodal support","virus\u2019s persistence","optimal tree","introns","direct future assessments of viral diversity","primary factor","genes","large-scale phylogenomic studies","subtribe Rhinonycterina","Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum","unique retrotransposon insertion","effects of outlier taxa","origin","Africa","family level","predictor of new emerging disease","replicative ability","divergence times","largest genus","Eocene","mammals","phylogram"],"language":"en"},

We show that the envelope glycoprotein Gn of hantaviruses binds genomic RNA through its cytoplasmic tail (CT). The nucleic acid binding of Gn-CT is unspecific, as demonstrated by interactions with unrelated RNA and with single-stranded DNA. Peptide scan and protein deletions of Gn-CT mapped the nucleic acid binding to regions that overlap with the previously characterized N protein binding sites and demonstrated the carboxyl-terminal part of Gn-CT to be the most potent nucleic acid-binding site.

By using real-time data sources, a digital syndromic surveillance system can overcome the limitation of time-delay in traditional surveillance systems. Here, we introduce an approach to develop such a digital surveillance system. METHODS: We first explain how the statistics data of infectious diseases, such as influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea, can be collected for reference data. Then we also explain how search engine queries can be retrieved from Google Trends. Finally, we describe the implementation of the prediction model using lagged correlation, which can be calculated by the statistical packages, i.e., SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). RESULTS: Lag correlation analyses demonstrated that search engine data/Twitter have a significant temporal relationship with influenza and MERS data. Therefore, the proposed digital surveillance system can be used to predict infectious disease outbreaks earlier. CONCLUSIONS: This prediction method could be the core engine for implementing a (near-) real-time digital surveillance system. A digital surveillance system that uses Internet resources has enormous potential to monitor disease outbreaks in the early phase.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Dong-Woo; Shin, Soo-Yong","journal":"Healthc Inform Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a183646896ed073a4ec4035c5b6c6c77db89f0b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5688036.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2017.23.4.343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29181246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Trends","SPSS (Statistical Package","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["digital syndromic surveillance system","real-time digital surveillance system","proposed digital surveillance system","search engine data","MERS data","traditional surveillance systems","reference data","search engine queries","real-time data sources","search queries","statistics data of infectious diseases","earlier detection of infectious disease outbreaks","influenza","core engine","lagged correlation","prediction model","prediction method","Social Sciences","social media","statistical packages","Lag correlation analyses","significant temporal relationship","Internet resources","Twitter","limitation of time","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","enormous potential","delay","SPSS","Korea","implementation","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","early phase","Google Trends","CONCLUSIONS","approach","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, the imaging risk factors for poor clinical outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the imaging characteristics and risk factors associated with adverse composite endpoints in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 24 designated hospitals in Jiangsu province, China, between 10 January and 18 February 2020. Clinical and initial CT findings at admission were extracted from medical records. Patients aged \u003C 18 years or without available clinical or CT records were excluded. The composite endpoints were admission to ICU, acute respiratory failure occurrence, or shock during hospitalization. The volume, density, and location of lesions, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation, were quantitatively analyzed in each patient. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors among age and CT parameters associated with the composite endpoints. Results: In this study, 625 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled; among them, 179 patients without an initial CT at admission and 25 patients aged \u003C 18 years old were excluded and 421 patients were included in analysis. The median age was 48.0 years and the male proportion was 53% (224/421). During the follow-up period, 64 (15%) patients had a composite endpoint.

During purification, the full-length GST-RdRp was found to cleave into three main fragments: an N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment, and a C-terminal p64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain, presumably due to bacterial proteases. Biochemical assays show that the full-length GST-RdRp has RdRp activity and the p64 and p12 fragments form a complex that exhibits comparable RdRp activity, whereas the GST-p64 protein has no activity, suggesting that the p12 domain is required for polymerase activity possibly via involvement in template-primer binding.

In the case of HIV-1, we and others reported the existence of an additional antiviral mechanism through which IFITMs lead to the production of virions of reduced infectivity. However, whether this second mechanism of inhibition is unique to HIV or extends to other viruses is currently unknown. To address this question, we have analyzed the susceptibility of a broad spectrum of viruses to the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity by IFITMs. The results we have gathered indicate that this second antiviral property of IFITMs extends well beyond HIV and we were able to identify viruses susceptible to the three IFITMs altogether (HIV-1, SIV, MLV, MPMV, VSV, MeV, EBOV, WNV), as well as viruses that displayed a member-specific susceptibility (EBV, DUGV), or were resistant to all IFITMs (HCV, RVFV, MOPV, AAV). The swapping of genetic elements between resistant and susceptible viruses allowed us to point to specificities in the viral mode of assembly, rather than glycoproteins as dominant factors of susceptibility. However, we also show that, contrarily to X4-, R5-tropic HIV-1 envelopes confer resistance against IFITM3, suggesting that viral receptors add an additional layer of complexity in the IFITMs-HIV interplay. Lastly, we show that the overall antiviral effects ascribed to IFITMs during spreading infections, are the result of a bimodal inhibition in which IFITMs act both by protecting target cells from incoming viruses and in driving the production of virions of reduced infectivity. Overall, our study reports for the first time that the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity is a conserved antiviral property of IFITMs and establishes IFITMs as a paradigm of restriction factor capable of interfering with two distinct phases of a virus life cycle.","publish_time":"2017-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tartour, Kevin; Nguyen, Xuan-Nhi; Appourchaux, Romain; Assil, Sonia; Barateau, V\u00E9ronique; Bloyet, Louis-Marie; Burlaud Gaillard, Julien; Confort, Marie-Pierre; Escudero-Perez, Beatriz; Gruffat, Henri; Hong, Saw See; Moroso, Marie; Reynard, Olivier; Reynard, St\u00E9phanie; Decembre, Elodie; Ftaich, Najate; Rossi, Axel; Wu, Nannan; Arnaud, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rick; Baize, Sylvain; Dreux, Marl\u00E8ne; Gerlier, Denis; Paranhos-Baccala, Glaucia; Volchkov, Viktor; Roingeard, Philippe; Cimarelli, Andrea","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/736d5109d55feed08b21d5b95eff52f2e50eea59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5619827.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28957419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITMs lead","IFITMs act","IFITMs-HIV interplay","conserved antiviral property of IFITMs","incoming viruses","viruses susceptible","susceptible viruses","case of HIV","additional antiviral mechanism","broad antiviral factors","broad spectrum of viruses","reduced infectivity","virion particles infectivity","R5-tropic HIV","overall antiviral effects","incoming virions","production of virions","negative imprinting","target cells","dominant factors of susceptibility","mechanism of inhibition","member-specific susceptibility","viral receptors","bimodal inhibition","additional layer of complexity","viral mode of assembly","distinct phases","VSV","endosomal vesicles","paradigm of restriction factor capable of interfering","MeV","MPMV","envelopes","MLV","glycoproteins","resistance","HCV","swapping of genetic elements","EBOV","virus life cycle","IFITM3","EBV","time","WNV","SIV","DUGV","RVFV","MOPV","specificities","AAV","X4","infections","existence","study reports","question","results"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXR and CT findings of 50 patients who fulfilled the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for S-OIV infection were reviewed by four radiologists. The final study group of 50 patients was divided into two subgroups on the basis of clinical course: group 1 consisted of 42 patients requiring noninvasive mechanical ventilation and admitted to the UTSIR; group 2 consisted of eight patients who required ICU admission and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or advanced mechanical ventilation from October 2009 to December 2009. All patients underwent CXR and thinsection multidetector CT (MDCT) scan; the initial and follow-up radiographs and CT scans were evaluated for the presentation and follow-up pattern (consolidation, groundglass opacities, nodules, reticulation), distribution and extent of abnormality. RESULTS: All patients had radiological signs of pulmonary involvement. Ground-glass opacity and consolidation, which was mainly peripheral, was the most frequent finding. In three patients, we report for the first time in viral pneumonia the reversed halo sign. Lesion extent was related to aggressiveness of the illness. More often, both lungs were involved (82%). Thoracic comorbidity was present in 18% of patients; 22% of patients was obese, and in this group, the clinical course was more aggressive than in the others with the same lesion extent at imaging. Furthermore, superinfection led to worsening of the clinical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The most common CXR and CT findings in patients with S-OIV infection were unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation. On MDCT, ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation had a predominant peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution, resembling organising pneumonia; they progressed to bilateral extensive airspace disease in severely ill patients.","publish_time":"2011-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valente, T.; Lassandro, F.; Marino, M.; Squillante, F.; Aliperta, M.; Muto, R.","journal":"Radiol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe69dcc3011734beca6c32debf336cb225bcd1bb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22020427/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-011-0734-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit","CT","World Health Organisation","ICU","CXR"],"locations":["Naples"],"keyphrases":["consecutive patients","ill patients","CT findings","CT scans","bilateral ground-glass opacities","S-OIV infection","common CXR","Lesion extent","thinsection multidetector CT","multifocal areas of consolidation","Ground-glass opacity","groundglass opacities","viral pneumonia","findings of pulmonary complications","follow-up radiographs","MDCT","UTSIR","basis of clinical course","final study group","clinical conditions","extent of abnormality","resembling organising pneumonia","advanced mechanical ventilation","noninvasive mechanical ventilation","subpleural distribution","ICU admission","follow-up pattern","chest radiographs","Intensive Care Unit","Subintensive Respiratory Unit","bilateral extensive airspace disease","radiological signs of pulmonary involvement","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","severe novel swine-origin influenza","predominant peribronchovascular","H1N1","criteria","selected population","virus","Monaldi Hospital","reticulation","nodules","presentation","reversed halo sign","World Health Organisation","Naples","time","authors","tomography","subgroups","METHODS","Italy","PURPOSE","aggressiveness","RESULTS","MATERIALS","frequent finding","Thoracic comorbidity","CONCLUSIONS","imaging","radiologists","illness","superinfection","lungs"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, searching for more effective compounds to reduce the toxicity of treatments, while still producing similar effects as current chemotherapy regimens, is required. Currently, the search for potential anticancer agents involves a random, inaccurate process with strategic deficits and a lack of specific targets. For this reason, the initial in vitro high-throughput steps in the screening process should be reviewed for rapid identification of the compounds that may serve as anticancer agents. The present study aimed to investigate the potential use of the Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168H expressing DNA topoisomerase I (SMD1168H-TOPOI) in a yeast-based assay for screening potential anticancer agents. The cell density that indicated the growth of the recombinant yeast without treatment was first measured by spectrophotometry. Subsequently, the effects of glutamate (agonist) and camptothecin (antagonist) on the recombinant yeast cell density were investigated using the same approach, and finally, the effect of camptothecin on various cell lines was determined and compared with its effect on recombinant yeast. The current study demonstrated that growth was enhanced in SMD1168H-TOPOI as compared with that in SMD1168H. Glutamate also enhanced the growth of the SMD1168H; however, the growth effect was not enhanced in SMD1168H-TOPOI treated with glutamate. By contrast, camptothecin caused only lower cell density and growth throughout the treatment of SMD1168H-TOPOI. The findings of the current study indicated that SMD1168H-TOPOI has similar characteristics to MDA-MB-231 cells; therefore, it can be used in a yeast-based assay to screen for more effective compounds that may inhibit the growth of highly metastatic breast cancer cells.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xin, Jian; Mahtar, Wan Nor Azlin Wan; Siah, Poh Chiew; Miswan, Noorizan; Khoo, Boon Yin","journal":"Mol Med Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1d7c0ed2db49bcc8e49814b1bb24bd01f9ba8c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6522884.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2019.10201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Glutamate"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SMD1168H-TOPOI","treatment of SMD1168H","growth effect","recombinant yeast cell density","yeast-based assay","effect of camptothecin","current study","screening potential anticancer agents","Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168H","lower cell density","effective compounds","effects of glutamate","screening process","potential use","high toxicity","similar effects","various cell lines","Cancer chemotherapy","current chemotherapy regimens","present study","inaccurate process","similar characteristics","toxicity of treatments","metastatic breast cancer cells","high-throughput steps","DNA topoisomerase","strategic deficits","antagonist","MDA-MB","lack of specific targets","higher concentration of drugs","rapid identification","contrast","search","patients","reason","findings","approach","spectrophotometry"],"language":"en"},

A retrospective review of the patients\u2019 medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high (18)F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism.

officially reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019 (World Health Organization 2020a) The coronavirus disease had initially been compared with an ordinary flu, and Dr Li Wenliang, who raised the alarm in the early days of the outbreak, was investigated by the Chinese police and the Public Security Bureau for \u2018spreading rumours\u2019 Yet it soon became obvious that Covid-19 is far more dangerous than the flu, and Dr Li Wenliang, aged 33, died of the infection on 7 February 2020 (Hegarty 2020) In spite of their harsh initial reactions to Dr Li Wenliang\u2019s alleged whistleblowing, Chinese authorities soon exhibited remarkable determination in containing the virus By late January, they quarantined the city of Wuhan (11 million inhabitants) and several other areas affecting over 60 million of people \u2018Since February 18, China has reported the number of recovered cases is vastly outpacing the number of new confirmed cases each day \u2019 (Roper 2020) In the meantime, the coronavirus has crossed the borders of China, and Western countries have been much slower in their response On 11 March, the World Health Organization \u2018declared COVID-19 a pandemic, pointing to the over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and territories around the world and the sustained risk of further global spread\u2019 (Ducharme 2020) and on 13 March, \u2018[i] nternational health officials said Friday that Europe has become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, as the continent is now producing more new cases each day than China did at the height of its crisis\u2019 (Coote and Jacobson 2020) In popular media, the Covid-19 pandemic has started an infodemic of unprecedented scale;fake news and bullshit flourish alongside credible information from sources such as the World Health Organization In the context of research, the Covid-19 pandemic has initiated historically unprecedented levels of collaboration and openness, prompting some authors to suggest that \u2018[w] hen the story of the coronavirus (2019-nCOV) is finally written, it might well become a template for the utopian dream of open science \u2014 where research data is shared freely, unrestrained by competition, paywalls and patents\u2019 (Crowe 2020) Worldwide closures of schools and universities have pushed millions of students and teachers online, bringing decades of experience in the field under the public eye (Bates 2020) Commentators compare Chinese and Western responses to the crisis, often under bombastic titles such as \u2018Coronavirus and the Clash of Civilizations\u2019 (Ma\u00E7\u00E3es 2020) Political scientists discuss whether the pandemic is an argument for total dismissal of capitalism or just a passing aberration in its functioning (Roberts 2020) Economists advise us to prepare the new recession (Elliott 2020) Sociologists see worldwide border closures as an anti-globalization experiment (Peters et al 2020), and philosophers go back to questions pertaining to human nature Worldwide governments are responding in radically different ways\u2014the government of Montenegro has closed down the whole country before it registered the first patient within its borders (World Health Organization 2020b), while the UK has opted for a laissez faire approach which is hoped to result in herd immunity (Dunn and Kahn 2020) From official news to social networks, everyone and anyone has something to contribute to these debates, creating an infodemic which will be analysed long after Covid-19 is gone As I write these words on 16 March 2020 from self-isolation in my flat in Zagreb, Croatia, the future of the pandemic is unclear We have no idea what percentage of the global population will be affected by the virus, whether the virus will mutate, how many people the virus might kill, and what might happen with our politics and economy after the pandemic is gone At this point, we need to develop immediate measures to protect ourselves individually and collectively\u2014weed out reliable information, self-isolate, reduce panic, develop educated guesses and emergency plans However, these urgent

Some alterations of glycosylation, such as sialic acid hydrolysis, are related to protein dysfunction. Because of their high flexibility and the many reactive groups of the glycan chains, studying glycans with in vitro methods is a challenging task. Molecular dynamics is a useful tool and probably the only one in biology able to overcome this problem and gives access to conformational information through exhaustive sampling. To better decipher the impact of N-glycans, the analysis and visualization of their influence over time on protein structure is a prerequisite. We developed the Umbrella Visualization, a graphical method that assigns the glycan intrinsic flexibility during a molecular dynamics trajectory. The density plot generated by this method brought relevant informations regarding glycans dynamics and flexibility, but needs further development in order to integrate an accurate description of the protein topology and its interactions. We propose here to transform this analysis method into a visualization mode in UnityMol. UnityMol is a molecular editor, viewer and prototyping platform, coded in C#. The new representation of glycan chains presented in this study takes into account both the main positions adopted by each antenna of a glycan and their statistical relevance. By displaying the collected data on the protein surface, one is then able to investigate the protein/glycan interactions.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Besan\u00E7on, Camille; Guillot, Alexandre; Blaise, S\u00E9bastien; Dauchez, Manuel; Belloy, Nicolas; Pr\u00E9voteau-Jonquet, Jessica; Baud, St\u00E9phanie","journal":"Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94c536f91e8c227a5411a614320919f9e39b4dcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128144.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046202319300283; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.07.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202319300283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302178/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Umbrella Visualization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein structure","protein surface","protein topology","protein dysfunction","glycan interactions","glycan intrinsic flexibility","glycans dynamics","impacting protein functions","analysis method","molecular dynamics trajectory","new representation of glycan chains","graphical method","molecular editor","high flexibility","visualization mode","Umbrella Visualization","UnityMol","Abstract N-glycosylation","alterations of glycosylation","impact of N","biology able","post-translational modification","relevant informations","access","conformational information","problem","prototyping platform","viewer","time","reactive groups","influence","accurate description","sialic acid hydrolysis","exhaustive sampling","antenna","methods","study","main positions","account","order","development","collected data","prerequisite","useful tool","challenging task","density plot","statistical relevance","C#"],"language":"en"},

Four siRNA expression cassettes driven by mouse U6 promoter targeting SARS-CoV N gene were prepared, and their inhibitory effects on expression of N and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion protein were observed. A candidate siRNA was proved to down-regulate N and EGFP expression actively in a sequence-specific manner.

This observation suggests a genetic predisposition to the disease. Epidemiological surveys conducted in Japan for some years point to a genetic factor but without proof. Childhood systemic febrile vasculitis is hard to recognise, so its diagnosis is often made lately, while there is an effective therapy, which prevents from serious cardiovascular complications. Identification of its precise cause, a necessary step before any diagnostic laboratory test, will be a major breakthrough.","publish_time":"2006-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caquard, M.; Parlier, G.; Siret, D.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5558b9b15a0a761b7e4ea495f5432d53cfdc13cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118996.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X06000777; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X06000777","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japon","Japan"],"keyphrases":["genetic predisposition to the disease","hypoth\u00E8se","identification","some years point to","This observation suggests","so its diagnosis is often","children suffering from Kawasaki disease in the same family at","Abstract This article presents the clinical observation","Childhood systemic febrile vasculitis is hard to recognise","Kawasaki survenus","complications cardiaques","facteur g\u00E9n\u00E9tique","cas de maladie","pr\u00E9disposition g\u00E9n\u00E9tique","gravit\u00E9 de la maladie","while there is an effective therapy","which prevents from serious cardiovascular complications","its precise cause","genetic factor but without","enfant reste de diagnostic difficile","Epidemiological surveys conducted in Japan","necessary step before any diagnostic laboratory test","lately","cases","will be","\u00E9tape pr\u00E9alable indispensable","mise","\u00E9ventuel marqueur diagnostique sp\u00E9cifique","Japon","\u00E9tiologie pr\u00E9cise","enqu\u00EAtes \u00E9pid\u00E9miologiques men\u00E9es","major breakthrough","fratrie","progr\u00E8s majeur","year interval","vascularite f\u00E9brile","ann\u00E9es","traitement efficace","ans d\u0027intervalle","affection","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","preuve","observations"],"language":"fr"},

During infection, viruses trigger the host cell stress response, leading to changes in RNA translation and the assembly of large aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes, termed stress granules (SGs). Several reports demonstrate that flaviviruses modulate the assembly of stress granules (SG). As an emerging pathogen, little is known however about how ZIKV modulates the host cell stress response. In this work, we investigate how ZIKV modulates SG assembly. We demonstrate that ZIKV negatively impacts SG assembly under oxidative stress conditions induced by sodium arsenite (Ars), a treatment that leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1. By contrast, no measurable difference in SG assembly was observed between mock and ZIKV-infected cells treated with sodium selenite (Se) or Pateamine A (PatA), compounds that trigger eIF2\u03B1-independent SG assembly. Interestingly, ZIKV infection markedly impaired the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 triggered in Ars-treated infected cells, and the abrogation of SG assembly in ZIKV-infected cells is, at least in part, dependent on eIF2\u03B1 dephosphorylation. These data demonstrate that ZIKV elicits mechanisms to counteract host anti-viral stress responses to promote a cellular environment propitious for viral replication.","publish_time":"2017-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amorim, Raquel; Temzi, Abdelkrim; Griffin, Bryan D.; Mouland, Andrew J.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd45834afc3184d92957993038c6889353797fc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5531678.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","SG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assembly of stress granules","ZIKV infection","abrogation of SG assembly","ZIKV-infected cells","eIF2\u03B1-independent SG assembly","host cell stress response","termed stress granules","phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","oxidative stress conditions","host anti-viral stress responses","eIF2\u03B1 dephosphorylation","assembly of large aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes","RNA translation","sodium arsenite","sodium selenite","viral replication","emerging pathogen","recent emerging arbovirus","cellular environment propitious","mechanisms","changes","Pateamine","compounds","pandemic potential","PatA","member","SGs","measurable difference","flaviviruses","Flaviviridae family","treatment","contrast","Zika virus","reports","data","work"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the distribution of HBoV1 and determine the effect of meteorological conditions, hospitalized pediatric patients were studied in a subtropical region of China. METHODS: Samples from 11,399 hospitalized pediatric patients (\u226414 years old), with ARI were tested for HBoV1 and other common respiratory pathogens using real-time PCR, between July 2009 and June 2016. In addition, local meteorological data were collected. RESULTS: Of the 11,399 patients tested, 5606 (49.2%) were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Two hundred forty-eight of 11,399 (2.2%) were positive for HBoV1 infection. Co-infection was common in HBoV1-positive patients (45.2%, 112/248). A significant difference in the prevalence of HBoV1 was found in patients in different age groups (p \u003C 0.001), and the peak prevalence was found in patients aged 7\u201312 months (4.7%, 56/1203). Two HBoV1 prevalence peaks were found in summer (between June and September) and winter (between November and December). The prevalence of HBoV1 was significantly positively correlated with mean temperature and negatively correlated with mean relative humidity, and the mean temperature in the preceding month had better explanatory power than the current monthly temperature. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a better understanding of the characteristics of HBoV1 infection in children in subtropical regions. Data from this study provide useful information for the future control and prevention of HBoV1 infections.","publish_time":"2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wen-Kuan; Liu, Qian; Chen, De-Hui; Tan, Wei-Ping; Cai, Yong; Qiu, Shu-Yan; Xu, Duo; Li, Chi; Li, Xiao; Lin, Zheng-Shi; Zhou, Rong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2f78c95ab378a31bd35dc1de84e0ec75eb7ce1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6048719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012099/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3225-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of HBoV1","HBoV1-positive patients","distribution of HBoV1","characteristics of HBoV1 infection","HBoV1 prevalence peaks","prevention of HBoV1 infections","hospitalized pediatric patients","mean temperature","Co-infection","peak prevalence","effect of meteorological conditions","common respiratory pathogens","ARI","study","local meteorological data","mean relative humidity","current monthly temperature","subtropical regions","better understanding","important cause of acute respiratory illness","subtropical region of China","future control","explanatory power","useful information","preceding month","children","years old","different age groups","real-time PCR","Samples","epidemiology","METHODS","addition","BACKGROUND","Human bocavirus","significant difference","summer","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","months","winter"],"language":"en"},

Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells with methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD), a drug used to deplete cholesterol from cellular membrane, significantly reduced PRRSV infection in a dose-dependent manner.

In turn, response plans are focused on developing and/or increasing inventories of a strain-specific vaccine, antivirals, intensive care beds, mechanical ventilators, and so on. Yet, there is strong and consistent evidence of epidemiologically and clinically important interactions between influenza and secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens, including during the 1918 pandemic. Countermeasures (eg, vaccination against pneumococcal and meningococcal disease before a pandemic; mass uses of antibiotic(s) with broad spectrums of activity against common bacterial respiratory pathogens during local epidemics) designed to prevent or mitigate the effects of influenza-bacterial interactions should be major focuses of pandemic-related research, prevention, and response planning.","publish_time":"2006-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brundage, John F","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dec1cade89375bf8f754ecc6507502786a151e06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106411.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309906704662; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309906704662","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","pandemic strain","pandemic-related deaths","major focuses of pandemic","bacterial interactions","common bacterial respiratory pathogens","secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens","bacterial superinfections","effects of influenza","related research","acute respiratory distress syndrome","important interactions","meningococcal disease","fewer deaths","response planning","response plans","strain-specific vaccine","natural progression of disease","antivirals","intensive care beds","broad spectrums of activity","end states","primary viral pneumonias","antibiotic","mass","prevention","local epidemics","mechanical ventilators","vaccination","epidemiological characteristics","consistent evidence","inventories","subsequent pandemics","Countermeasures","turn","Determinative beliefs","Summary"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular properties and clinical characteristics of RSV infection. The study sample included 238 patients \u003C5 years old who were hospitalized with clinical symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (URTI or LRTI) in the Pediatric Department at the First People\u0027s Hospital of Chenzhou, South China in 2014. We subjected nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) or nasal swab (NS) samples from the patients to indirect fluorescence assay screens. RSV G genes were amplified by reverse transcription\u2010PCR (RT\u2010PCR) and sequenced. Of the 238 patients screened, 64 (26.8%) were confirmed to have RSV infections. Of those 64 confirmed RSV infection cases, 39 (60.9%) had subtype BA9, 13 (20.3%) had the recently identified subtype ON1, 11 (17.2%) had subtype NA1, and 1 (1.6%) had subtype GB2. The predominant presentation was LRTI with coughing, sputum production, fever, and wheezing. RSV subtype NA1 and BA9 infections were found mostly in infants, whereas the age distribution of subtype ON1 infections was more uniform across the age bands. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that, compared with the prototype strain A2, all ON1 and most NA1 isolates had lost one potential N\u2010glycosylation site at amino acid 251 and 249 due to T251K and N249Y substitution, respectively. These findings suggest that NA1, BA9, and ON1 are the dominant RSV subtypes causing respiratory tract infections in young children presenting to the hospital in South China. J. Med.

Genetic evolution analysis indicates that all swine influenza viruses (SIVs) possessed full-length PA-X prior to 1985, but since then SIVs with truncated PA-X have gradually increased and become dominant, implying that truncation of this protein may contribute to the adaptation of influenza virus in pigs. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed PA-X extended viruses in the background of a \u201Ctriple-reassortment\u201D H1N2 SIV with truncated PA-X, and evaluated their biological characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Compared with full-length PA-X, SIV with truncated PA-X had increased viral replication in porcine cells and swine respiratory tissues, along with enhanced pathogenicity, replication and transmissibility in pigs.

These molecules are able to directly inhibit many viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Dengue Virus, Ebola Virus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus through binding to envelope protein N-glycans. In the case of HIV, it has been shown that CBAs select for mutant viruses with N-glycosylation site deletions which are more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. In this study we aimed at evaluating the HCV resistance to CBAs in vitro. HCV was cultivated in the presence of increasing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cyanovirin-N, Concanavalin-A or Griffithsin concentrations, during more than eight weeks. At the end of lectin exposure, the genome of the isolated strains was sequenced and several potential resistance mutations in the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins were identified. The effect of these mutations on viral fitness as well as on sensitivity to inhibition by lectins, soluble CD81 or the 3/11 neutralizing antibody was assessed. Surprisingly, none of these mutations, alone or in combination, conferred resistance to CBAs. In contrast, we observed that some mutants were more sensitive to 3/11 or CD81-LEL inhibition. Additionally, several mutations were identified in the Core and the non-structural proteins. Thus, our results suggest that in contrast to HIV, HCV resistance to CBAs is not directly conferred by mutations in the envelope protein genes but could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins. Further investigations are needed to completely elucidate the underlying mechanisms.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Izquierdo, Laure; Oliveira, Catarina; Fournier, Carole; Descamps, V\u00E9ronique; Morel, Virginie; Dubuisson, Jean; Brochot, Etienne; Francois, Catherine; Castelain, Sandrine; Duverlie, Gilles; Helle, Francois","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad60294d191a68f9db374d7ec49f42c2303b3b00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752358.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26871442/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149064","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CBAs","HCV resistance","potential resistance mutations","conferred resistance","Ebola Virus","Dengue Virus","envelope protein N-glycans","Hepatitis C Virus","Human Immunodeficiency Virus","Cyanovirin-N","envelope protein genes","viral proteins","case of HIV","contrast","E1E2 envelope glycoproteins","CD81-LEL inhibition","N-glycosylation site deletions","mutant viruses","soluble CD81","viral fitness","natural lectins","non-structural proteins","neutralizing antibody","Carbohydrate binding agents","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","GNA","presence of increasing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin","genome","sensitivity","isolated strains","Concanavalin","indirect mechanism","combination","end of lectin exposure","Griffithsin concentrations","Core","effect","mutants","results","broad-spectrum antivirals","underlying mechanisms","molecules","weeks","antibodies","study","investigations"],"language":"en"},

The mechanism of this RA is not well understood. Objective We sought to explore the relationship between neutrophils and other biomarkers of RA. Method Sixty patients with RA, 30 patients with nonrefractory asthma (NRA), and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled. We performed a comprehensive characterization of these study subjects, which included laboratory and pulmonary function studies, chest computed tomography, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). We analyzed BAL fluid and serum for a total of 244 biomolecules using a multiplex assay and correlated them with clinical and other laboratory parameters. Results RA was significantly different from NRA with regard to pulmonary function indices, bronchial basement membrane thickness, and BAL fluid neutrophil and lymphocyte counts but not eosinophil counts. BAL fluid neutrophil counts negatively and positively correlated with forced vital capacity and age, respectively. Of the 244 biomolecules studied, 52 and 14 biomolecules from BAL fluid and serum, respectively, were significantly different among the study groups. Thirteen of these 52 molecules correlated with BAL fluid neutrophil counts. BAL fluid from 40% of patients with RA was positive for a pathogenic microbe. Infection-negative neutrophilic RA was associated with an increase in levels of select biomarkers of inflammation in the serum, suggesting the presence of systemic inflammation. Conclusions RA was associated with increased numbers of neutrophils and proneutrophilic biomolecules in the airways. Subclinical infection was present in 40% of patients with RA, which likely contributed to neutrophilic inflammation.

We show that for papain, replacing the terminal carboxylate group of a peptide inhibitor with a hydrogen atom decreases binding 3\u20134 fold while replacing an aldehyde or glyoxal group with a hydrogen atom decreases binding by 300,000\u20131,000,000 fold. Thiohemiacetal formation by papain with aldehyde or glyoxal inhibitors is shown to be ~ 10,000 times more effective than hemiacetal or hemiketal formation with chymotrypsin. It is shown using effective molarities, that for papain, thiohemiacetal stabilization is more effective with aldehyde inhibitors than with glyoxal inhibitors. The effective molarity obtained when papain is inhibited by an aldehyde inhibitor is similar to the effective molarity obtained when chymotrypsin is inhibited by glyoxal inhibitors showing that both enzymes can stabilize tetrahedral adducts by similar amounts. Therefore the greater potency of aldehyde and glyoxal inhibitors with papain is not due to greater thiohemiacetal stabilization by papain compared to the hemiketal and hemiacetal stabilization by chymotrypsin, instead it reflects the greater intrinsic reactivity of the catalytic thiol group of papain compared to the catalytic hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin. It is argued that while the hemiacetals and thiohemiacetals formed with the serine and cysteine proteases respectively can mimic the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate they are also analogues of the productive and non-productive acyl intermediates that can be formed with the cysteine and serine proteases.","publish_time":"2015-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cleary, Jennifer A.; Doherty, William; Evans, Paul; Malthouse, J.

Panther Fusion\u00AE Respiratory Assays (Fusion), which includes FluA/B/RSV (FFABR), Paraflu and AdV/hMPV/RV, offers a modular approach to syndromic testing on a fully automated platform while improving gene targets and expanding the test menu. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated Fusion using 275 consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens previously used in an analysis of five PCRs, as well as 225 archived specimens. RESULTS: Of the combined 500 specimens, 134 were positive for influenza A (FluA), 54 for FluB, 65 for RSV, 64 for parainfluenza (PIV), 24 for adenovirus (AdV), 21 for humanmetapneumovirus (hMPV), and 40 for rhinovirus (RV) with Fusion. Of the positive samples Fusion correlated with historical results for all but one, despite multiple freeze-thaws cycles of this collection. Fusion was positive for an additional 33 samples, including 11 FluAs, 7 RSVs, 3 PIV3s, 3 AdV, 6 hMPV and 3 RVs. These samples were retested with corresponding Prodesse (Pro) assays using quadruple sample volume. This resolver test confirmed Fusion results for an additional 4 FluAs, 4 RSVs, 1 PIV3 and 3 AdVs. The sensitivity and specificity ranges of Fusion were 99\u2013100% and 98\u2013100%. Limit of detection (LOD) analyses were performed on a variety of Flu isolates. The LODs ranged from 2.69 to 2.99 log copies/ml and demonstrated superior LOD as compared to previously published data for some assays or to concurrent analyses with two new commercial tests.","publish_time":"2019-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stellrecht, Kathleen A.; Cimino, Jesse L.; Wilson, Lisa I.; Maceira, Vincente P.; Butt, Shafiq A.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4cb5f051397c82c13605b8f3739e60f5adfcd37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172166.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219302343; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219302343; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.104204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31743836/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","FluA/B/RSV","LOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive samples Fusion","Panther Fusion","specificity ranges of Fusion","resolver test confirmed Fusion results","hMPV","Respiratory Assays","superior LOD","FluAs","historical results","RSVs","archived specimens","respiratory virus testing","consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens","syndromic testing","concurrent analyses","test menu","superior diagnostic accuracy","new commercial tests","Nucleic acid amplification tests","NAATs","gene targets","automated platform","faster turnaround time","FFABR","Paraflu","modular approach","corresponding Prodesse","quadruple sample volume","BACKGROUND","published data","PIV3s","multiple freeze-thaws cycles","collection","log copies","analysis","Limit of detection","STUDY DESIGN","sensitivity","rhinovirus","variety of Flu isolates","PCRs","OBJECTIVES","parainfluenza","AdVs","adenovirus","FluB","RVs","humanmetapneumovirus","LODs"],"language":"en"},

Viral infections trigger anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) responses by stimulating endosomal and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). However, viruses have also evolved many strategies to counteract IFN responses. Are there intracellular danger signals that enhance immune responses to viruses? During infection, viruses place a heavy demand on the protein folding machinery of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To survive ER stress, host cells mount an unfolded protein response (UPR) to decrease ER protein load and enhance protein-folding capacity. Viruses also directly elicit the UPR to enhance their replication. Increasing evidence supports an intersection between the host UPR and inflammation, in particular the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN. The UPR directly activates pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription factors and dramatically enhances cytokine production in response to viral PRR engagement. Additionally, viral PRR engagement may stimulate specific pathways within the UPR to enhance cytokine production. Through these mechanisms, viral detection via the UPR and inflammatory cytokine production are intertwined. Consequently, the UPR response is perfectly poised to act as an infection-triggered \u201Cdanger\u201D signal. The UPR may serve as an internal \u201Cco-stimulatory\u201D signal that (1) provides specificity and (2) critically augments responses to overcome viral subterfuge. Further work is needed to test this hypothesis during viral infections.","publish_time":"2014-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Judith A.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d968bbfddfa8eb4f1cad1f00ed121ec2c4a4df6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4032990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904537/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00222","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host UPR","UPR response","Viral infections","immune responses","IFN responses","viral detection","viral subterfuge","viruses","inflammatory cytokine production","viral PRR engagement","anti-viral type","appropriate responses","intracellular danger signals","unfolded protein response","ER protein load","combinations of signals","production of pro-inflammatory cytokines","pathogen specific signals","protein-folding capacity","pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription factors","host cells","immune strength","immune system","ER stress","host endoplasmic reticulum","context of co-stimulatory","specific pathways","machinery","interferon","cytosolic pattern recognition receptors","heavy demand","inflammation","PRRs","intersection","hypothesis","accuracy","mechanisms","strategies","evidence","work","specificity","replication"],"language":"en"},

However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the transmission dynamics within and between bat species, as well as from bats to other mammals. To better understand these processes, it is important to compare the phylogenetic relationships between different agents to that of their respective hosts. In this study, we analysed more than 950 urine, faeces and oral swab samples collected from 653 bats from mainly four species (Myotis nattereri, Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis daubentonii, and Plecotus auritus) for the presence of coronavirus, paramyxovirus and astrovirus related nucleic acids located in three different regions of Germany. Using hemi-nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR amplification of fragments within the highly conserved regions of the respective RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, we detected astrovirus sequences at an overall detection rate of 25.8% of the analysed animals, with a maximum of 65% in local populations. The detection rates for coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were distinctly lower, ranging between 1.4% and 3.1%. Interestingly, the sequence similarities in samples collected from the same bat species in different geographical areas were distinctly larger than the sequence similarities between samples from different species sampled at the same location. This indicates that host specificity may be more important than host ecology for the presence of certain viruses in bats.","publish_time":"2015-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, Kerstin; Zeus, Veronika; Kwasnitschka, Linda; Kerth, Gerald; Haase, Martin; Groschup, Martin H.; Balkema-Buschmann, Anne","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c865720daa05131ffead022ca3f59e074cc914f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106178.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26584511/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.11.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156713481530040X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713481530040X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["different species","different bat species","different agents","bats","different regions of Germany","different geographical areas","Myotis bechsteinii","Myotis daubentonii","Myotis nattereri","sequence similarities","oral swab samples","respective RNA dependent RNA polymerase","astrovirus sequences","presence of coronavirus","conserved regions","host ecology","respective hosts","infectious agents","detection rates","host specificity","analysed animals","presence of certain viruses","overall detection rate","RdRp","genes","nucleic acids","PCR amplification of fragments","Plecotus auritus","transmission dynamics","hemi-nested reverse transcriptase","zoonotic potential","maximum","coronaviruses","paramyxoviruses","urine","faeces","phylogenetic relationships","lack of knowledge","local populations","location","processes","mammals","study"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis of viral infections improved considerably during the 1990s, with the advent of highly sensitive techniques, such as enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and PCR, rendering TEM obsolete for this purpose.

OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the current research was to investigate the effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice root) on HSV-1. One of the objectives of the current research was to determine the efficacy and the effect of the elapsed incubation time of treating the Vero cells infected with HSV-1 by G. glabra. In addition, the effect of cells pretreatment with licorice root extract, preincubation of virus with licorice root extract, and the antiviral activity were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Vero cells were incubated after adding different concentrations of aqueous extracts of G. glabra. The cells were incubated during various time courses. Cytotoxicity assay, determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)), and incubation of HSV-1 with licorice root extract prior to viral infection were performed. RESULTS: Internal association among different experiment groups showed the significant difference in the efficacy of the extract with regard to incubation period between one and four hours, one and eight hours, four and 12 hours, and eight and 12 hours. Moreover, there was a significant difference with regard to efficacy among the pretreatment of cells with extract for two hours, incubation of virus with extract for one hour, incubation of virus with extract for two hours.

Intrathecal antibody (Ab) synthesis is well documented in humans afflicted by infections associated with neurological complications, as well as the demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. This review focuses on the origin, recruitment, maintenance, and biological relevance of Ab-secreting cells (ASC) found in the central nervous system (CNS) following experimental neurotropic RNA virus infections. We will summarize evidence for a highly dynamic, evolving humoral response characterized by temporal alterations in B cell subsets, proliferation, and differentiation. Overall local Ab plays a beneficial role via complement-independent control of virus replication, although cross or self-reactive Ab to CNS antigens may contribute to immune-mediated pathogenesis during some infections. Importantly, protective Ab exert anti-viral activity not only by direct neutralization, but also by binding to cell surface-expressed viral glycoproteins. Ab engagement of viral glycoproteins blocks budding and mediates intracellular signaling leading to restored homeostatic and innate functions. The sustained Ab production by local ASC, as well as chemokines and cytokines associated with ASC recruitment and retention, are highlighted as critical components of immune control.","publish_time":"2013-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phares, Timothy W.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb56f2e5caa4992c01aedc47943146ee81cac007.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3640523.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v5020732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23435240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASC","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["local Ab","self-reactive Ab","protective Ab","biological relevance of Ab","Ab engagement of viral glycoproteins blocks","sustained Ab production","ASC recruitment","acute encephalitic viral infections","local ASC","anti-viral activity","experimental neurotropic RNA virus infections","central nervous system","CNS antigens","cell surface","critical components of immune control","complement-independent control of virus replication","B cell subsets","immune-mediated pathogenesis","temporal alterations","beneficial role","target","proliferation","retention","binding","maintenance","secreting cells","chemokines","humoral response","direct neutralization","synthesis","cytokines","demyelinating disease","multiple sclerosis","innate functions","origin","differentiation","reservoir","neurological complications","humans","Intrathecal antibody","persisting viruses","review","evidence"],"language":"en"},

We sought to quantify the contribution of a wide range of infectious diseases to the overall infectious disease burden in a high-income setting. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used health-adjusted life years (HALYs), a composite measure comprising premature mortality and reduced functioning due to disease, to estimate the burden of 51 infectious diseases and associated syndromes in Ontario using 2005\u20132007 data. Deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. The 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost HALYs, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. The most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis C virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, Clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. The top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total infectious disease burden, respectively. Marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. The main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Infectious diseases continue to cause a substantial health burden in high-income settings such as Ontario. Most of this burden is attributable to a relatively small number of infectious agents, for which many effective interventions have been previously identified. Therefore, these findings should be used to guide public health policy, planning, and research.","publish_time":"2012-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwong, Jeffrey C.; Ratnasingham, Sujitha; Campitelli, Michael A.; Daneman, Nick; Deeks, Shelley L.; Manuel, Douglas G.; Allen, Vanessa G.; Bayoumi, Ahmed M.; Fazil, Aamir; Fisman, David N.; Gershon, Andrea S.; Gournis, Effie; Heathcote, E.

Unfortunately, the most potent adjuvants are often associated with toxicity and safety issues. Inulin, a plant-derived polysaccharide, has no immunological activity in its native soluble form but when crystallised into stable microparticles (delta inulin) acquires potent adjuvant activity. Delta inulin has been shown to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses against a broad range of co-administered viral, bacterial, parasitic and toxin antigens. Inulin normally crystallises as large heterogeneous particles with a broad size distribution and variable solubility temperatures. To ensure reproducible delta inulin particles with a consistent size distribution and temperature of solubility, a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) process was designed to produce Advax\u2122 adjuvant. In its cGMP form, Advax\u2122 adjuvant has proved successful in human trials of vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza, hepatitis B and insect sting anaphylaxis, enhancing antibody and T-cell responses while at the same time being safe and well tolerated.

Currently, vaccines derived from PEDV classical strains do not effectively prevent infection by virulent PEDV strains, and no specific drug is available to treat the disease. RNA interference (RNAi) is a novel and effective way to cure a wide range of viruses. We constructed three short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids (shR-N307, shR-N463, and shR-N1071) directed against nucleocapsid (N) and determined their antiviral activities in intestine epithelial cells infected with a classical CV777 strain and LNCT2. We verified that shR-N307, shR-N463, and shR-N1071 effectively inhibited the expression of the transfected N gene in vitro, comparable to the control shRNA. We further demonstrated the shRNAs markedly reduced PEDV CV777 and LNCT2 replication upon downregulation of N production.

Viruses purified from supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells contained prM protein and were unable to fuse C6/36 mosquito cells from without. When ammonium chloride was removed from the cells, both the processing of prM and the fusion activity of the purified viruses were partially restored. By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327. Since prM-containing viruses were up to 400-fold more resistant to a low pH environment, we conclude that the E-prM interaction might be necessary to protect the E protein from irreversible conformational changes caused by maturation into the acidic vesicles of the exocytic pathway.","publish_time":"1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guirakhoo, Farshad; Bolin, Richard A.; Roehrig, John T.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16aa672efa22f7191a6d18e74fa774103bb16cb7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290267S; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290267S","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Murray Valley"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prM protein","virus prM","processing of prM","E-prM interaction","membrane protein","glycoprotein of MVE virus","MVE virus particles","infected cells","mosquito cells","purified viruses","supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells","proteolytic processing","acidotropic agent ammonium chloride","virus replication cycle","flavivirus maturation","corresponding antibodies","monoclonal antibodies","amino acids","Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments","sequence-specific peptide antisera","Murray Valley encephalitis","irreversible conformational changes","envelope","fusion activity","acidic vesicles","low pH environment","fold","MAbs","C6","precursor","exocytic pathway","role","site","epitopes"],"language":"en"},

CD13 participates in several functions such as proteolytic regulation of bioactive peptides, viral receptor, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. CD13 has also been proposed to participate in cell adhesion, as crosslinking of CD13 by certain CD13-specific antibodies induces homotypic aggregation of monocytes and heterotypic adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs C and E) that block homotypic aggregation of U-937 monocytic cells induced by CD13-specific mAb 452. Moreover, the mAbs cause detachment of cells whose aggregation was induced by CD13 crosslinking. Both mAbs also inhibit heterotypic adhesion of U-937 monocytes to endothelial cells. mAbs C and E recognize membrane CD13 but bind to epitopes different from that recognized by mAb 452. Crosslinking of CD13 by mAb C or E is required to inhibit adhesion, as monovalent Fab fragments are not sufficient. Thus, C and E antibodies recognize a distinct epitope on CD13, and binding to this epitope interferes with both CD13-mediated cell adhesion and enzymatic activity. These antibodies may represent important tools to study cell-cell interactions mediated by CD13 in physiological and pathological conditions.","publish_time":"2018-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garay-Canales, Claudia A.; Licona-Lim\u00F3n, Ileana; Ortega, Enrique","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95375dac99b10d7628f9c154db3799825c2f101f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5896358.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789790/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4093435","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["crosslinking of CD13","CD13 crosslinking","membrane CD13","CD13-mediated cell adhesion","CD13-specific mAb","certain CD13-specific antibodies","endothelial cells","E antibodies","heterotypic adhesion of monocytes","cell-cell interactions","dendritic cells","myeloid cells","monocytic cells","mAb C","homotypic aggregation of monocytes","cell types","heterotypic adhesion of U","mAbs cause detachment of cells","monoclonal antibodies","homotypic aggregation of U","distinct epitope","aminopeptidase activity","membrane glycoprotein","enzymatic activity","viral receptor","angiogenesis","proteolytic regulation of bioactive peptides","important tools","monovalent Fab fragments","functions","macrophages","binding","epitopes different","tumor metastasis","pathological conditions","neutrophils"],"language":"en"},

This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis.","publish_time":"2007-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vogel, Leatrice N.; Roberts, Anjeanette; Paddock, Christopher D.; Genrich, Gillian L.; Lamirande, Elaine W.; Kapadia, Sagar U.; Rose, John K.; Zaki, Sherif R.; Subbarao, Kanta","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0aa98e80546e920ee739d0f7145031080a6af8f0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8e706c240839154f4fb123d28c5b57e078703bc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1847333.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06012515; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06012515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV challenge","SARS-CoV infections","aged BALB","c mouse model","lungs of aged mice","viral load","control strategies","preventive strategies","efficacy of vaccines","licensed vaccines","antibody titers sufficient","high level of viral replication","passive transfer of serum antibody","association","vaccination","clinical illness","evaluation","causative agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","disease","treatments","promise","histopathologic changes","extent of protection","utility","Potential prevention","weight loss","coronavirus","immunoprophylaxis","outbreak","study","elderly","animal models","approaches"],"language":"en"},

Comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke are strongly associated with the need of intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hrusak, Ondrej; Kalina, Tomas; Wolf, Joshua; Balduzzi, Adriana; Provenzi, Massimo; Rizzari, Carmelo; Rives, Susana; del Pozo Carlavilla, Mar\u00EDa; Valerio Alonso, Maria Eli; Dom\u00EDnguez Pinilla, Nerea; Bourquin, Jean-Pierre; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Grillner, Pernilla; Mellgren, Karin; Ten Bosch van der Werff, J.; Pieters, Rob; Brozou, Triantafyllia; Borkhardt, Arndt; Escherich, Gabriele; Lauten, Melchior; Stanulla, Martin; Smith, Owen; Juh Yeoh, Allen Eng; Elitzur, Sarah; Vora, Ajay; Li, Chi-Kong; Ariffin, Hany; Kolenova, Alexandra; Dallapozza, Luciano; Farah, Roula; Lazic, Jelena; Manabe, Atsushi; Styczynski, Jan; Kovacs, Gabor; Ottoffy, Gabor; Felice, Marisa; Buldini, Barbara; Conter, Valentino; Stary, Jan; Schrappe, Martin","journal":"Eur J Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141482.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305831/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe course of COVID","asymptomatic course of COVID","beginning of COVID","immunocompromised children","anticancer treatment","treatment options","oncological treatment","flash survey","need of intensive treatment","mild disease","elderly","risk","intensity of preventive measures","short web based survey","uneven age distribution","severity","Wuhan","China","COVID19 incidence","delays","possible explanation","anti-cancer chemotherapy","anecdotal information","hypertension","obstructions","dismal outcome","email","Comorbidities","particular diabetes","line","smoke","METHODS","young adults","cases","reports","countries","patients","weaker immunity","obesity","place","INTRODUCTION","pandemics","RESULTS","leukemia","Respondents","AIM","time","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

A number of enteroviruses, including echoviruses (EV) and group B coxsackieviruses (CVB), initiate infection by attaching to decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a molecule that is highly expressed on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. We previously observed that entry of DAF-binding CVB3 into polarized intestinal epithelial cells occurs by an unusual endocytic mechanism that requires caveolin but does not involve clathrin or dynamin. Here we examined the entry of a DAF-binding echovirus, EV7. We found that drugs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and dominant negative mutants that target factors required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including clathrin and dynamin, inhibited both EV7 infection and internalization of virions from the cell surface. Once virus had entered the cell, it colocalized with markers of early endosomes (EEA1) and then late endosomes (LAMP-2). Inhibition of endosomal maturation\u2014with siRNAs or dominant negative mutants targeting Rab5 and Rab7\u2014inhibited infection and prevented release of viral RNA into the cell. These results indicate that EV7 is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and then moves to early and late endosomes before releasing its RNA. Trafficking through endosomes is known to be important for viruses that depend on low pH or endosomal cathepsin proteases to complete the entry process. However, we found that EV7 infection required neither low pH nor cathepsins.","publish_time":"2012-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Chonsaeng; Bergelson, Jeffrey M.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff368c9be888417304869b18575ea6521dcc95b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3324788.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00304-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22496312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV7 infection","inhibited infection","entry of DAF","late endosomes","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","cell surface","markers of early endosomes","polarized intestinal epithelial cells","siRNAs","dominant negative mutants","low pH","DAF-binding echovirus","apical surface of polarized epithelial cells","entry process","polarized epithelium","dynamin","binding CVB3","intestinal mucosa","number of enteroviruses","endosomal cathepsin proteases","Inhibition of endosomal maturation","release of viral RNA","Rab7","Rab5","factors","group B coxsackieviruses","echoviruses","unusual endocytic mechanism","EEA1","internalization of virions","small interfering RNAs","drugs","caveolin","decay-accelerating factor","host","cathepsins","molecule","LAMP","Trafficking","results"],"language":"en"},

The literature has failed to consistently or adequately report subject age group, sex, ability level, and/or event-distance specialization. The demands of training and racing are relatively unquantified. Multiple definitions and reporting methods for injury and illness have been implemented. In general, risk factors for maladaptation have not been well-described. The data thus far collected indicate that the sport of triathlon is relatively safe for the well-prepared, well-supplied athlete. Most injuries \u2018causing cessation or reduction of training or seeking of medical aid\u2019 are not serious. However, as the extent to which they recur may be high and is undocumented, injury outcome is unclear. The sudden death rate for competition is 1.5 (0.9\u20132.5) [mostly swim-related] occurrences for every 100,000 participations. The sudden death rate is unknown for training, although stroke risk may be increased, in the long-term, in genetically susceptible athletes. During heavy training and up to 5 days post-competition, host protection against pathogens may also be compromised. The incidence of illness seems low, but its outcome is unclear. More prospective investigation of the immunological, oxidative stress-related and cardiovascular effects of triathlon training and competition is warranted. Training diaries may prove to be a promising method of monitoring negative adaptation and its potential risk factors. More longitudinal, medical-tent-based studies of the aetiology and treatment demands of race-related injury and illness are needed.

Normal exons are generally targeted to restore the dystrophin reading frame however, an appreciable subset of dystrophin mutations are intra-exonic and therefore have the potential to compromise oligomer efficiency, necessitating personalised oligomer design for some patients. Although antisense oligomers are easily personalised, it remains unclear whether all patient polymorphisms within antisense oligomer target sequences will require the costly process of producing and validating patient specific compounds. METHODS: Here we report preclinical testing of a panel of splice switching antisense oligomers, designed to excise exon 25 from the dystrophin transcript, in normal and dystrophic patient cells. These patient cells harbour a single base insertion in exon 25 that lies within the target sequence of an oligomer shown to be effective at removing exon 25. RESULTS: It was anticipated that such a mutation would compromise oligomer binding and efficiency. However, we show that, despite the mismatch an oligomer, designed and optimised to excise exon 25 from the normal dystrophin mRNA, removes the mutated exon 25 more efficiently than the mutation-specific oligomer. CONCLUSION: This raises the possibility that mismatched AOs could still be therapeutically applicable in some cases, negating the necessity to produce patient-specific compounds.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fragall, Clayton T; Adams, Abbie M; Johnsen, Russell D; Kole, Ryszard; Fletcher, Sue; Wilton, Steve D","journal":"BMC Med Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/612fc352956cba3b9e5e74179125dc5d9aadba23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3213239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22013876/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2350-12-141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Becker"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oligomer efficiency","mutation-specific oligomer","oligomer binding","antisense oligomer target sequences","personalised oligomer design","mutated exon","patient specific compounds","patient-specific compounds","patient polymorphisms","dystrophin transcript","dystrophin isoform","normal dystrophin mRNA","antisense oligomers","dystrophic patient cells","appreciable subset of dystrophin mutations","causative mutation","Normal exons","functional Becker muscular dystrophy","severity of Duchenne muscular dystrophy","splicing","pre-RNA processing","intra-exonic","panel of splice","costly process","single base insertion","preclinical testing","potential","necessity","frame","patients","BACKGROUND","possibility","AOs","cases","METHODS","CONCLUSION","mismatch","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We screened children \u003C 2 years old with acute respiratory tract infections admitted to an urban tertiary hospital for respiratory viruses from March 2008 through February 2010, using polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were identified in 378 (53%) of the 715 samples analyzed. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most commonly identified virus (52%), followed by adenovirus (27%) and Human metapneumovirus (12%). More than one virus was identified in 19% of specimens. Almost half of the samples (46%) were from children with underlying health conditions. We demonstrated that compared to the previously healthy group, those with comorbidities had a worse outcome in terms of severity, with prolonged hospital stay and more need of intensive care.

We aim to provide a platform exclusively for discussions of individual and age differences in susceptibility and immune responses to COVID caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and how to prevent or reduce severity of disease in older adults.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pawelec, Graham; Weng, Nan-ping","journal":"Immun Ageing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4392bbd0e9b8c44a244c798d69b93acea8fd0a34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148425.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00180-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32300370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","immunity","older adults","old people","younger people","context of SARS","infection","emergence of SARS","age differences","susceptibility","immune responses","mild symptoms","health care systems","severe challenges","systemic conditions","issues relevant","wellbeing of millions","ageing","COVID","discussions of individual","global economy","welcome papers","rapid spread","understanding","knowledge","severity of disease","platform","peer-review"],"language":"en"},

Recurrent viral respiratory infections and subsequent complications (e.g. acute otitis media (AOM)) are a burden for children, their families and society. Over the past decade, our knowledge on the significance of respiratory viruses has broadened remarkably. Viruses cause large variety of respiratory diseases and cause alone diseases, which previously have been assumed to be bacterial only (e.g. AOM and pneumonia). Methods for detection analysis of respiratory viruses are developing making both the diagnosis and epidemiological investigations of respiratory infections easier. Accurate diagnosis of respiratory infections and awareness of possible viral etiology could reduce the use of antibiotics.

Approximately 100 DUBs exist in human cells and are involved in key regulatory cellular processes, which drive many disease states, making them attractive therapeutic targets. Several aspects of DUB biology have been studied through genetic knock-out or knock-down, genomic, or proteomic studies. However, investigation of enzyme activation and regulation requires additional tools to monitor cellular and physiological dynamics. A comparison between genetic ablation and dominant-negative target validation with pharmacological inhibition often leads to striking discrepancies. Activity probes have been used to profile classes of enzymes, including DUBs, and allow functional and dynamic properties to be assigned to individual proteins. The ability to directly monitor DUB activity within a native biological system is essential for understanding the physiological and pathological role of individual DUBs. We will discuss the evolution of DUB activity probes, from in vitro assay development to their use in monitoring DUB activity in cells and in animal tissues, as well as recent progress and prospects for assessing DUB inhibition in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harrigan, Jeanine; Jacq, Xavier","journal":"Proteostasis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb4c355c9a6f64c442a8defda0ff7edb827b5ccd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DUB inhibition","monitoring DUB activity","evolution of DUB activity probes","aspects of DUB biology","pathological role of individual DUBs","class of enzymes","Deubiquitylating enzymes","classes of enzymes","genetic knock","pharmacological inhibition","genetic ablation","physiological dynamics","human cells","individual proteins","key regulatory cellular processes","dominant-negative target validation","additional tools","regulation","assay development","use","native biological system","disease states","polypeptide posttranslational modification ubiquitin","recent progress","animal tissues","investigation of enzyme activation","number of substrates","dynamic properties","prospects","attractive therapeutic targets","striking discrepancies","comparison","proteomic studies","ability"],"language":"en"},

Functions of the BRB are to regulate fluids and molecular movement between the ocular vascular beds and retinal tissues and to prevent leakage of macromolecules and other potentially harmful agents into the retina, keeping the microenvironment of the retina and retinal neurons. These functions are mainly attributed to absent fenestrations of RCECs, tight junctions, expression of a great diversity of transporters, and coverage of pericytes and glial cells. BRB existence also becomes a reason that systemic administration for some drugs is not suitable for the treatment of retinal diseases.

Cell fusion can be successfully applied by creating cellular therapeutic of donor \u2013 recipient chimeric cell (DRCC) in the field of solid organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA). Immunomodulatory DRCC therapy has the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for toxic, life-long immunosuppression and to prevent both acute and chronic rejection. This innovative VCA treatment is a combination of ex vivo created chimeric cell therapy with a short-term selective protocol of monoclonal antibody and Cyclosporine A. The utilization of short-term immunosuppressive protocol will provide the opportunity for chimeric cell engraftment, proliferation, and re-education of recipient\u2019s immune system resulting in prolongation of allograft survival. The use of chimeric cells, as a supportive treatment for VCA, would improve the conditions of severely disfigured patients by offering safe alternative approach and providing better functional and aesthetic results compared to standard reconstructive procedures.

Overactivity of RAAS promotes both systemic and regional glomerular capillary hypertension, which could induce hemodynamic injury to the glomerulus, leading to kidney damage and renal fibrosis via profibrotic and proinflammatory pathway. Therefore, the use of RAAS inhibitors (i.e., ACEIs, ARBs, and MRAs) as the optional therapy has been demonstrated to prevent proteinuria, and kidney fibrosis and slow the decline of renal function effectively in the process of kidney disease during the last few decades. Recently, several new components of the RAAS have been discovered, including ACE2 and the corresponding ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis, which are also present in the kidney. Besides the classic RAAS inhibitors target the angiotensin-AT1-aldosterone axis, with the expanding knowledge about RAAS, a number of potential therapeutic targets in this system is emerging. Newer agents that are more specific are being developed. The present chapter outlines the insights of the RAAS agents (classic RAAS antagonists/the new RAAS drugs), and discusses its clinical application in the combat of renal fibrosis.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ying-Ying; Yu, Ying; Yu, Chen","journal":"Renal Fibrosis: Mechanisms and Therapies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17ed615cc4dd1037a4c9cd722d2d0664c371ca97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzcwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RAAS agents","Overactivity of RAAS","classic RAAS inhibitors","classic RAAS antagonists","new RAAS drugs","use of RAAS inhibitors","kidney fibrosis","kidney damage","combat of renal fibrosis","aldosterone system","aldosterone axis","process of kidney disease","decline of renal function","angiotensin-AT1","corresponding ACE2","Newer agents","new components","Mas axis","present chapter","profibrotic","regional glomerular capillary hypertension","fluid volume","number of potential therapeutic targets","expanding knowledge","insights","MRAs","glomerulus","clinical application","proinflammatory pathway","ACEIs","blood pressure","sodium balance","hemodynamic injury","ARBs","rennin","proteinuria","optional therapy","decades"],"language":"en"},

Since the discovery of the archetype withaferin A in 1965, approximately 900 of these naturally occurring, polyoxygenated steroidal lactones with 28-carbon ergostane skeletons have been discovered across 24 diverse structural types. Subsequently, extensive pharmacologic research has identified multiple mechanisms of action across key inflammatory pathways. In this chapter we identify and describe the major withanolides with anti-inflammatory properties, illustrate their role within essential and supportive inflammatory pathways (including NF-\u03BAB, JAK/STAT, AP-1, PPAR\u03B3, Hsp90 Nrf2, and HIF-1), and then discuss the clinical application of these withanolides in inflammation-mediated chronic diseases (including arthritis, autoimmune, cancer, neurodegenerative, and neurobehavioral). These naturally derived compounds exhibit remarkable biologic activity across these complex disease processes, while showing minimal adverse effects.

Moreover, recent findings have documented a divergent group of arenaviruses in captive alethinophidian snakes. Human infections occur through mucosal exposure to aerosols or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials. Arenaviruses merit interest both as highly tractable experimental model systems to study acute and persistent infections and as clinically important human pathogens including Lassa (LASV) and Junin (JUNV) viruses, the causative agents of Lassa and Argentine hemorrhagic fevers (AHFs), respectively, for which there are no FDA-licensed vaccines, and current therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin (Rib) that has significant limitations. Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bi-segmented negative strand (NS) RNA genome. Each genome segment, L (ca 7.3 kb) and S (ca 3.5 kb), uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two polypeptides in opposite orientation, separated by a noncoding intergenic region (IGR). The S genomic RNA encodes the virus nucleoprotein (NP) and the precursor (GPC) of the virus surface glycoprotein that mediates virus receptor recognition and cell entry via endocytosis. The L genome RNA encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or L polymerase) and the small (ca 11 kDa) RING finger protein Z that has functions of a bona fide matrix protein including directing virus budding. Arenaviruses were thought to be relatively stable genetically with intra- and interspecies amino acid sequence identities of 90\u201395 % and 44\u201363 %, respectively. However, recent evidence has documented extensive arenavirus genetic variability in the field. Moreover, dramatic phenotypic differences have been documented among closely related LCMV isolates. These data provide strong evidence of viral quasispecies involvement in arenavirus adaptability and pathogenesis. Here, we will review several aspects of the molecular biology of arenaviruses, phylogeny and evolution, and quasispecies dynamics of arenavirus populations for a better understanding of arenavirus pathogenesis, as well as for the development of novel antiviral strategies to combat arenavirus infections.","publish_time":"2015-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grande-P\u00E9rez, Ana; Martin, Veronica; Moreno, Hector; de la Torre, Juan C.","journal":"Quasispecies: From Theory to Experimental Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b7d75592f76297286d31c1a5a2e9904a6f5c447.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzcxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Arenaviridae","LCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["arenavirus infections","RNA genome","genome RNA","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","arenavirus adaptability","Arenaviruses merit","S genomic RNA","virus nucleoprotein","directing virus","Human infections","viral species","divergent group of arenaviruses","molecular biology of arenaviruses","quasispecies dynamics of arenavirus populations","better understanding of arenavirus pathogenesis","virus receptor recognition","virus surface glycoprotein","extensive arenavirus genetic variability","persistent infections","recent evidence","genome segment","strong evidence of viral quasispecies involvement","enveloped viruses","matrix protein","recent findings","causative agents of Lassa","important human pathogens","main rodent species","RING finger protein Z","direct contact of abraded skin","bi-segmented negative strand","synthesis","LASV","functions","kDa","aerosols","phylogeny","evolution","Argentine hemorrhagic fevers","tractable experimental model systems","natural reservoir","interspecies amino acid sequence identities","mucosal exposure","JUNV","GPC","cell entry","NP","RdRp","captive alethinophidian snakes","opposite orientation","infectious materials","development of novel antiviral strategies","noncoding intergenic region","case","endocytosis","AHFs","precursor","Junin","field","data","FDA-licensed vaccines","current therapy","label use of ribavirin","ambisense coding strategy","IGR","polypeptides","aspects","significant limitations","phyllostomid bats","family Arenaviridae","dramatic phenotypic differences","related LCMV isolates"],"language":"en"},

This chapter summarizes the current knowledge of the entry pathway and the role of the fusion protein of influenza virus, hemagglutinin, in this process. Hemagglutinin (HA) is a trimeric glycoprotein that is present in multiple copies in the membrane envelope of influenza virus. HA contains a fusion peptide, a receptor binding site, a metastable structural motif, and the transmembrane domain. The first step of influenza virus entry is the recognition of the host cell receptor molecule, terminal \u03B1-sialic acid, by HA. This multivalent attachment by multiple copies of trimetric HA triggers endocytosis of influenza virus that is contained in the endosome. The endosome-trapped virus traffics via a unidirectional pathway to near the nucleus. At this location, the interior pH of the endosome becomes acidic that induces a dramatic conformational change in HA to insert the fusion peptide into the host membrane, induce juxtaposition of the two membranes, and form a fusion pore that allows the release of the genome segments of influenza virus. HA plays a key role in the entire entry pathway. Inhibitors of virus entry are potentially effective antiviral drugs of influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2011-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Ming","journal":"Viral Molecular Machines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb7ec5664ac9fdb6abc2ff80826d6e8acb5f701e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123407.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123407/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hemagglutinin"],"organizations":["HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of influenza viruses","step of influenza virus entry","fusion protein of influenza virus","Inhibitors of virus entry","membrane envelope of influenza virus","genome segments of influenza virus","endosome-trapped virus","multiple copies of trimetric HA triggers endocytosis of influenza virus","fusion peptide","entire entry pathway","effective antiviral drugs of influenza viruses","host membrane","fusion pore","host cell receptor molecule","host cell infection","unidirectional pathway","enveloped viruses","hemagglutinin","key role","receptor binding site","recognition","terminal \u03B1-sialic acid","metastable structural motif","number of steps","release","trimeric glycoprotein","dramatic conformational change","multivalent attachment","interior pH","current knowledge","transmembrane domain","membranes","juxtaposition","location","chapter","nucleus","process"],"language":"en"},

Colostrum-deprived (CD) calves, or calves receiving one dose of pooled control colostrum (CC) or immune colostrum (IC), containing an IgG1 titer to bovine rotavirus (BRV) of 1:16,384 or 1:262,144, respectively, were orally inoculated with 10(5.5) FFU of IND (P[5]G6) BRV at 2 days of age. Calves were monitored daily for diarrhea, virus shedding and anti-BRV Abs in feces by ELISA. Anti-rotavirus Ab titers in serum were evaluated weekly by isotype-specific ELISA and virus neutralization (VN). At 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), all animals were euthanized and the number of anti-BRV antibody secreting cells (ASC) in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues were evaluated by ELISPOT. After colostrum intake, IC calves had significantly higher IgG1 serum titers (GMT=28,526) than CC (GMT=1195) or CD calves (GMT\u003C4). After BRV inoculation, all animals became infected with a mean duration of virus shedding between 6 and 10 days. However, IC calves had significantly fewer days of diarrhea (0.8 days) compared to CD and CC calves (11 and 7 days, respectively). In both groups receiving colostrum there was a delay in the onset of diarrhea and virus shedding associated with IgG1 in feces. In serum and feces, CD and CC calves had peak anti-BRV IgM titers at 7 dpi, but IgA and IgG1 responses were significantly lower in CC calves. Antibody titers detected in serum and feces were associated with circulation of ASC of the same isotype in blood. The IC calves had only an IgM response in feces. At 21 dpi, anti-BRV ASC responses were observed in all analyzed tissues of the three groups, except bone marrow. The intestine was the main site of ASC response against BRV and highest IgA ASC numbers. There was an inverse relationship between passive IgG1 titers and magnitude of ASC responses, with fewer IgG1 ASC in CC calves and significantly lower ASC numbers of all isotypes in IC calves. Thus, passive anti-BRV IgG1 negatively affects active immune responses in a dose-dependent manner. In ileal Peyer\u2019s patches, IgM ASC predominated in calves receiving colostrum; IgG1 ASC predominated in CD calves. The presence in IC calves of IgG1 in feces in the absence of an IgG1 ASC response is consistent with the transfer of serum IgG1 back into the gut contributing to the protection of the intestinal mucosa.","publish_time":"2004-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parre\u00F1o, V; B\u00E9jar, C; Vagnozzi, A; Barrandeguy, M; Costantini, V; Craig, M.I; Yuan, L; Hodgins, D; Saif, L; Fern\u00E1ndez, F","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23a54086dd25b8152833b28fe8ab19126409f8ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127479.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127479/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRV","ELISPOT","CC","ASC","IC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IC calves of IgG1","CC calves","CD calves","neonatal calves","IgG1 ASC response","fewer IgG1 ASC","IgG1 responses","anti-BRV ASC responses","passive anti-BRV IgG1","IgM ASC","passive IgG1 titers","circulation of ASC","feces","magnitude of ASC responses","anti-BRV Abs","transfer of serum IgG1","higher IgG1 serum titers","BRV inoculation","lower ASC numbers","immune colostrum","peak anti-BRV IgM titers","highest IgA ASC numbers","main site of ASC response","colostrum intake","Anti-rotavirus Ab titers","fewer days of diarrhea","Antibody titers","virus shedding","days of age","number of anti-BRV antibody secreting cells","active immune responses","mucosal immune responses","IgM response","GMT","days post-inoculation","dose of pooled control colostrum","virus neutralization","passive protection","bovine rotavirus","mean duration of virus","onset of diarrhea","animals","groups","isotype-specific ELISA","systemic lymphoid tissues","development of systemic","analyzed tissues","intestinal mucosa","dose-dependent manner","isotypes","absence","inverse relationship","ileal Peyer\u2019s patches","effect of colostral maternal antibodies","VN","delay","G6","ELISPOT","intestine","gut","presence","FFU of IND","bone marrow","blood"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to explore the impact of bacterial colonization on the severity of virus-induced wheezing, and accompanying airway inflammation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 68 hospitalized children with bronchiolitis and 85 children with recurrent wheezing were obtained. Eleven common respiratory viruses were sought by PCR and/or direct fluorescence assay. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Cell numbers and concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in the NPAs were measured, and nucleated cells were characterized. The frequency of bacterial colonization in children with recurrent wheezing was significantly higher than in children with an initial attack of bronchiolitis. Bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection had no effect on clinical manifestations, duration of hospitalization, concentrations of cytokines/chemokines (except interleukin-10 (IL-10)) or cellularity in the children with bronchiolitis; however, among the children with recurrent wheezing, those who had coexistent non-invasive bacterial colonization and virus infection presented more frequent cyanosis, longer duration of hospitalization, a higher concentration of IL-10 and a higher percentage of neutrophils in NPAs than those with virus infection but without bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization was common in children with virus-induced wheezing, particularly in the situation of recurrent wheezing. To some extent, bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection may contribute to the severity of the wheezing because of its impact on airway inflammation.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, D.; Wei, L.; Zhengxiu, L.; Jian, L.; Lijia, W.; Wei, L.; Xiqiang, Y.; Xiaodong, Z.; Zhou, F.; Enmei, L.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20174a0a241b83eafe67f99aed68cb0f165b9f11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128791.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzIy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasopharyngeal"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of bacterial colonization","frequency of bacterial colonization","virus-induced wheezing","virus infection","severity of virus","coexistent non-invasive bacterial colonization","situation of recurrent wheezing","hospitalized children","NPAs","severity of subsequent wheezing","accompanying airway inflammation","concentrations of cytokines","higher concentration of IL","chemokines","longer duration of hospitalization","higher percentage of neutrophils","initial attack of bronchiolitis","common respiratory viruses","frequent cyanosis","PCR","clinical manifestations","effect","likelihood","neonates","extent","Cell numbers","routine culture methods","direct fluorescence assay","interleukin","childhood","cellularity","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","nucleated cells","study"],"language":"en"},

In the presented study, a double-sandwich ELISA (pH1N1 ELISA), based on two monoclonal antibodies against haemagglutinin (HA) of the pH1N1 virus, was developed. After laboratory determination of the sensitivity and specificity characteristics, the performance of this assay was evaluated in a cohort of 904 patients with influenza-like illness. All seven strains of pH1N1 virus tested were positive by pH1N1 ELISA, with an average lower detection limit of 10(3.0 \u00B1 0.4) tissue culture infective dose (TCID)(50)/mL (or 0.009 \u00B1 0.005 HA titre). Cross-reaction of the assay with seasonal influenza virus and other common respiratory pathogens was rare. In pH1N1-infected patients, the sensitivity of the pH1N1 ELISA was 92.3% (84/91, 95% CI 84.8\u201396.9%), which is significantly higher than that of the BD Directigen EZ Flu A \u002B B test (70.3%, p \u003C0.01). The specificity of pH1N1 ELISA in seasonal influenza A patients was 100.0% (171/171, 95% CI 97.9\u2013100.0%), similar to that in non-influenza A patients (640/642, 99.7%, 95% CI 98.9\u2013100.0%). The positive predictive value for pH1N1 ELISA was 97.7% and the negative predictive value was 99.1% in this study population with a pH1N1 prevalence of 10.1%.

Drug-eluting stenting (DES), including paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES) and sirolimus-eluting stenting (SES), has been proven to have a lower restenotic rate. However, to date, few studies have investigated the clinical and angiographic results of DES in premature CAD patients. METHODS: Between February 2004 and October 2005, premature CAD patients, defined as those younger than 50 years ofage, who were treated with DES in our medical center were all retrospectively enrolled. Their baseline clinical characteristics, clinical outcome and angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients (M/F: 23/3) were enrolled, with a mean age of 44 \u00B16 years (range, 24\u201350 years). Conventional atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent in this study group, including diabetes mellitus (35%), hypertension (35%), hyperlipidemia (54%) and smoking (73%). Moreover, there was 1 homozygous and 1 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia case in our study group. In terms of angiographic results, there were 40 target lesions in 34 target vessels. Forty DES (39 PES, 1 SES) were implanted with a median stent diameter of 3 mm and median length of 24 mm. The clinical follow-up was counted up to May 2006, with a mean follow-up duration of 540 \u00B1168 days; 11 (42%) patients had a second angiogram during the follow-up period (200 \u00B198 days after DES). None of the patients had target lesion revascularization (TLR). In addition, there was no difference in TLR or stent thrombosis between patients with or without acute coronary syndrome. CONCLUSION: Based on our single-center experience, DES had good short-term follow-up results for a premature CAD group with diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.","publish_time":"2008-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ming-Hsiung; Lee, Wen-Lieng; Wang, Kuo-Yang; Hsieh, Yu-Cheng; Liu, Tsun-Jui; Lin, I-Hsiang; Lin, Wei-Wen; Ting, Chih-Tai; Liang, Kae-Woei","journal":"J Chin Med Assoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f18485c8eb332e4a939d0486ee1b0f58364bc13.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozkw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["premature CAD patients","angiographic results of DES","clinical follow-up","premature CAD group","angiographic follow-up results","family history of premature CAD","good short-term follow-up results","terms of angiographic results","follow-up period","multiple atherosclerotic risk factors","mean follow-up duration","study group","clinical outcome","Conventional atherosclerotic risk factors","multiple coexistent atherosclerotic risk factors","sirolimus-eluting stenting","paclitaxel-eluting stenting","Drug-eluting stenting","Premature coronary artery disease","baseline clinical characteristics","target lesions","TLR","PES","target vessels","SES","days","years ofage","target lesion revascularization","median stent diameter","heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia case","stent thrombosis","median length","medical center","mean age","single-center experience","acute coronary syndrome","strong link","special entity","difference","BACKGROUND","diabetes mellitus","studies","angiogram","hyperlipidemia","lower restenotic rate","hypertension","range","total","smoking","date","addition","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The results suggest that BW001 could be developed into a medication with the potential to treat CVB3 infectious diseases by inducing natural mixed IFNs.","publish_time":"2007-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cong, Zhongyi; Wan, Min; Wu, Xiuli; Wang, Li; Hu, Xiaoping; Yang, Fenglei; Bao, Musheng; Zhang, Xuesong; Chen, Jianzhu; Wang, Liying; Yu, Yongli","journal":"FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2713015d04c5e3c9d3d90f031021c78790524cec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2ce4ec238e2ea149cb20a1952334f4b8589e1ffc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110351.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzI2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxsackie"],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03C9","subtypes of IFN","BW001","anti-CVB3 activity","human PBMCs","CVB3 infectious diseases","induced IFNs","express mRNAs of multiple types of interferon","natural mixed IFNs","human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","C-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide","myocarditis","humans","antiviral therapy","significant pathogen","potential","early stages","Coxsackie B3 virus","medication","evidence","results"],"language":"en"},

Serum levels of ATG peaked on days 4 to 6 after initiation of therapy and became undetectable by day 13 as a result of canine antibody responses to ATG. ATG prolonged allogeneic skin graft survival to 14 days (n = 5), compared with 8 days in control dogs (P = .0003). Five dogs were given marrow transplants after ATG (3.5\u20135 mg/kg) and 1 Gy of TBI. Posttransplantation immunosuppression consisted of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. All dogs showed initial engraftment, with maximum donor chimerism levels of 25%. However, only 1 dog achieved sustained engraftment, and 4 rejected their grafts. The duration of engraftment ranged from 8 to \u226536 weeks (median, 11 weeks), and this is comparable to that in 6 historical controls not given ATG (range, 3\u201312 weeks; median, 10 weeks; P = .20).

Here, we present a detailed analysis of a previously proposed model that combines heterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network structure in response to a disease. We show that in this model, qualitative changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic description, one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation, whereas the other one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are accessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region, exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade, despite every agent returning to the susceptible class. We argue that this behaviour and the associated phase transitions can be expected to occur in a wide class of models of sufficient complexity.","publish_time":"2016-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Hui; Rogers, Tim; Gross, Thilo","journal":"Chaos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ece4fb9b8431ca574d59e769e79bd1353dbf1be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzM2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-local bifurcation","non-local heteroclinic bifurcation","bifurcation points","system","network structure","proposed model","behaviour","network inoculation","disease","associated phase transitions","macro-level dynamics","adaptive rewiring","mathematical analysis","heterogeneous networks","detailed analysis","susceptible class","wide class of models","exposure","heterogeneity","individuals","sufficient complexity","response","respective parameter region","rare example","pathogen","agent","epidemiological modelling","onset","qualitative changes","outbreak","configuration","macroscopic description"],"language":"en"},

JHM virus, LPS and AP are all capable of inducing Ia molecules on astrocytes, however, in a pattern and kinetics distinct from recombinant rat gamma interferon (\u03B3-IFN). Whereas \u03B3-IFN induced Ia expression on astrocytes and all macrophages after 48 h treatment, JHM virus, LPS and AP required 4\u20137 days for maximal induction of Ia on astrocytes, but had little to no effect on the macrophage population. This indicates that astrocytes are uniquely reactive to components derived from infectious agents and that these components are immunoregulatory with respect to Ia expression on astrocytes. We have also attempted to determine possible mechanisms by which these agents induce astrocyte Ia and show that phorbol myristate acetate and Ca(2\u002B) ionophore A23187 have similar effects.

Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4(\u002B)/CD8(\u002B) T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice. EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared. Entry of perivascular CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1(\u002B) cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1(\u002B) cells and a few CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) cells. Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase. SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4(\u002B)/CD8(\u002B) ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7. We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4(\u002B)/CD8(\u002B) T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice. SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Er\u00E4linna, J.P.; Soilu-H\u00E4nninen, M.; R\u00F6ytt\u00E4, M.; Ilonen, J.; M\u00E4kel\u00E4, M.; Salmi, A.; Salonen, R.","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119656/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAE","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of EAE","CD8","entry of inflammatory cells","irradiation prior EAE induction","histological signs of EAE","acute phase of EAE","SFV-A7 infection","resistant strain of mice","Entry of perivascular CD4","disease induction","T cell ratio","resistant mouse strain","CNS infiltrates","c mouse strain","resistant BALB","c mice","rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells","spleen of BALB","untreated mice","increase","Similar perivascular cell influx","onset of clinical signs","avirulent strain of Semliki Forest virus","cellular infiltrates","appearance of MAC","recovery phase","development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis","early crucial events","decrease","total number of lymphocytes","effect","central nervous system","natural resistance","mechanisms","immunoregulatory changes","combination"],"language":"en"},

It was confirmed that antibodies found satisfactory in these tests were suitable for a wide range of use including radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rod\u00E1k, L.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgM","IgA immunoglobulins","Class-specific antibodies","use of purified immunoglobulins","radioimmunological methods","class specificity","wide range of use","double antibody sandwich radioimmunoassay","IgG2","bovine IgG1","porcine IgG","radioimmunoelectrophoresis","tests","enzyme","immunosorbent assay","colostrum","normal serum"],"language":"en"},

However, the time trends for Th1 and Th2 immune responses during these phenomena have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To identify possible mechanisms underlying the link between respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 40 adults aged 21-58 years for 4 groups. A. Healthy, B. Healthy with viral infection, C. Mild to moderate asthma and D. Same as C, but with viral infection. Th1 and Th2 cytokines in induced sputum samples during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic individuals were monitored. IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-\u03B3 were assayed by ELISA. Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: IL-4 and IL-5 levels in groups C and D were higher than in groups A and B. IFN-\u03B3 levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group B spiked by day 2 and rapidly declined by day 7, while in group D, IFN-\u03B3 and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later (days 3-5) and slowly declined. The ratios of IL-4 and IL-5 to IFN-\u03B3 in group D were significantly higher than in group C. CONCLUSIONS: Infection-induced asthma exacerbations may be due to impaired anti-viral Th1-immune responses. There appears to be a critical window of 3-5 days for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2010-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ding; Xia, Jingwen; Chen, Xiaodong","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e833e12d4fb0a4ac62b2a2397747bd7fe2c5d733.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzE1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

All seven piglets infected with PRRSV showed a distinct, positive signal, scattered throughout the alveolar septa and spaces.

One-half of the pigs in each group were orally infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; the remaining pigs served as controls. Threeday-old control pigs concentrated the nonabsorbable fluid marker twelve f old along the small and large intestine, indicating an efficiency of about 95% in absorption of the exogenous daily fluid load presented to the intestine. In contrast, the marker concentration in infected pigs showed no change whatsoever along either the small or large intestine, indicating a complete absence of net fluid absorption or secretion in these animals. Three-week-old control pigs concentrated the marker similarly to the 3-day-old group, with the bulk of the fluid absorption occurring in the small intestine. Infected pigs in the 3-wk-old group had marked net fluid secretion in the proximal small intestine, so that about twice the fluid load was presented to the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs as compared to the 3-day-old infected group. However, in contrast to the 3-day-old infected group, the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs increased fluid absorption some six times over the control, and this compensatory response prevented diarrhea in these older animals. Analysis of luminal contents indicated that in the older pigs, unabsorbed carbohydrate was almost completely fermented to short-chain fatty acids in the colon, whereas in the younger pigs the carbohydrate passed through the colon unchanged. These results demonstrate that development of microbial digestion, together with rapid short-chain fatty acid absorption, is a primary feature responsible for the colonic compensation in the older pigs with transmissible gastroenteritis.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Argenzio, R.A.; Moon, H.W.; Kemeny, L.J.; Whipp, S.C.","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130427/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["older pigs","wk-old infected pigs","remaining pigs","large intestine","younger pigs","wkold pigs","Threeday-old control pigs","week-old control pigs","day-old infected group","wk-old group","proximal small intestine","day-old group","nonabsorbable fluid marker","net fluid secretion","Absorption of water","f old","complete absence of net fluid absorption","exogenous daily fluid load","marker concentration","older animals","rapid short-chain fatty acid absorption","nonabsorbable marker technique","contrast","short-chain fatty acids","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","unabsorbed carbohydrate","colon unchanged","colonic compensation","primary feature responsible","electrolytes","compensatory response","development of microbial digestion","diarrhea","bulk","times","results","Analysis of luminal contents","efficiency","controls"],"language":"en"},

From 1983 to 1990, we have necropsied 45 well preserved carcasses out of a total of 120 beluga whales reported dead over this period. Of these 45 animals, nine were affected by 10 malignant neoplasms. Fifteen animals (33%) were affected by pneumonia. Milk production was compromised in eight of 17 mature females (41%), by inflammatory changes (seven animals) and cancer (one animal) which affected the mammary glands. Opportunistic bacteria were found in pure culture, and/or in significant amounts in at least two organs in 20 belugas (44%). The concentrations of both total PCBs and highly chlorinated PCB congeners were much higher in St. Lawrence animals than in Arctic beluga whales. OC-induced immunosuppression has been repeatedly demonstrated in a wide variety of animal species. Therefore, it is probable that the immune functions of St. Lawrence beluga whales are impaired. Benzo[\u03B1]pyrene adducts were detected in 10 of the 11 St. Lawrence beluga whales of which tissues (six livers, 10/11 brains) were analyzed by a method based on HPLC. No such adducts were found in four Arctic animals. Since benzo[\u03B1]pyrene is one of the most potent chemical carcinogens known to man, these compounds might be responsible for some of the cancers observed in that population. Overall, our findings contrast vividly with those of others who found that cancers are exceedingly rare in free-ranging odontocete populations and that the major causes for mortalities in these populations are bacteria, parasites, and trauma.","publish_time":"1994-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martineau, D.; De Guise, S.; Fournier, M.; Shugart, L.; Girard, C.; Lagac\u00E9, A.; B\u00E9land, P.","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131023/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["St. Lawrence Estuary","PCB"],"locations":["Arctic"],"keyphrases":["Lawrence beluga whales","Lawrence animals","Arctic beluga whales","Arctic animals","Lawrence Estuary","cancers","pyrene","Benzo","organochlorinated compounds","odontocete populations","total PCBs","Opportunistic bacteria","indigenous population","OC-induced immunosuppression","wide variety of animal species","complex mixture of industrial pollutants","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","chlorinated PCB congeners","PAH","man","major causes","tissues","immune functions of","Delphinapterus leucas","mortalities","potent chemical carcinogens","heavy metals","pure culture","organs","brains","years","parasites","livers","period","significant amounts","inflammatory changes","method","mammary glands","trauma","preserved carcasses","concentrations","malignant neoplasms","Milk production","mature females","HPLC","belugas","pneumonia","findings"],"language":"en"},

The use of EIA is an extension of previously used serological tests, using enzyme-labeled antibody or antigen to determine antibody content. Direct detection of antigen by EIA represents a more dramatic departure from previous methods based on culture. Also, the method has enabled detection of infectious agents that are difficult to cultivate, such as hepatitis A virus and rotavirus, or agents that cannot be cultivated, such as hepatitis B. The use of EIA tests for detection of microbial antigens provides an alternative to culture as a means for direct identification of a specific microbial agent. It also provides a means to detect microbial agents which have not been successfully propagated. The detection of circulating antigen or detection of antigen in other body fluids by EIA is more difficult than detection of antibody because of the sensitivity required, and because of interfering substances in specimens such as feces and respiratory secretions. For this reason, very few antigen detection assays have the sensitivity and specificity required to be used as a primary diagnostic test. The number of tests that have been developed, however, is impressive and because of the possibilities for rapid, specific diagnosis, the interest in antigen detection by EIA remains high.","publish_time":"2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herrmann, John E.","journal":"Adv Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131335/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQ0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of antibody","Direct detection of antigen","antigen detection assays","detection of circulating antigen","detection of microbial antigens","detection of infectious agents","use of EIA tests","microbial agents","culture","specific microbial agent","sensitivity","means","serological tests","antibody content","number of tests","hepatitis","enzyme-immunoassay","direct identification","specific diagnosis","histochemical staining procedures","specimens","feces","enzymes","dramatic departure","alternative","body fluids","possibilities","interfering substances","previous methods","extension","respiratory secretions","rotavirus","specificity","reason","primary diagnostic test","Antibodies"],"language":"en"},

The role of CTL escape mutants in the viral evasion of the immune system and subsequent disease progression in non-CNS infections are summarized. The immune response in the CNS is similar to the response in extraneural tissue, but several aspects of the activation of the immune response, cellular trafficking, and antigen presentation are unique to the CNS. Although the CNS has classically been considered a site of immune privilege, surveillance of the normal CNS by circulating, activated lymphocytes occurs, with a limited number of lymphocytes being present in the normal CNS at any given time. In mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus and in some humans persistently infected with human immunodeficiency virus type1, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, CTL escape mutants play an important role in virus amplification and disease progression.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, Stanley; Wu, Gregory F.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131566/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQ4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cytotoxic CD8 T","CTL","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["normal CNS","virus amplification","variant virus","immune response","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis C virus","mouse hepatitis virus","immune system","non-CNS infections","human immunodeficiency virus type1","role of CTL escape mutants","Cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes","CTL epitope","site of immune privilege","infected cells","subsequent disease progression","limited number of lymphocytes","unique features of cytotoxic CD8 T cell function","important role","central nervous system","clearance of noncytopathic viruses","viral evasion","cellular trafficking","CTLs","humans","antigen presentation","surveillance","extraneural tissue","aspects","activation","sequence","recognition","given time","mice","chapter","mechanism","selection"],"language":"en"},

Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva (100 \u03BCl ml(\u22121)) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro. This suppressive effect of saliva may contribute to the lowerresponsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Antibody production by tick-infested cattle was examined during the third and fourth heavy tick infestation. Tick-infested cattle showed a diminished response against ovalbumin after the second immunization. The immunosuppressive effects of tick infestation may play an important role in tick survival or in the transmission of tick-borne diseases in the field.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inokuma, H.; Kerlin, R.L.; Kemp, D.H.; Willadsen, P.","journal":"Vet Parasitol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tick-infested cattle","stages of tick infestation","heavy tick infestation","tick-free cattle","tick survival","immunosuppressive effects of tick infestation","non-infested control cattle","response of PBL","response of bovine PBL","immunosuppressive effect of experimental Boophilus microplus infestation","lowerresponsiveness of PBL","Boophilus microplus saliva","percentage of T lymphocytes","percentage of B lymphocytes","diminished response","week","ovalbumin","PHA","larvae","bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes","host antibody production","suppressive effect of saliva","peak of adult engorgement","marginal decrease","middle","protein antigen","important role","transmission of tick-borne diseases","phytohemagglutinin","field","\u03BCl","ticks","immunization","end","noteworthy differences"],"language":"en"},

Other viruses, using similar mechanisms, are mentioned only briefly and tangentially. Retroviruses are a unique class of viruses that have been found in all classes of vertebrates but not in other organisms. Perhaps, their most distinctive properties are the flow of information from RNA to DNA early in the infectious process, and the subsequent integration of the viral DNA into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell. Retroviruses are the causative agents of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and of a variety of neoplastic diseases in man and domestic animals. Elements with striking similarities to retroviruses, termed retrotransposons, occur in yeast and many other eukaryotes; elements sharing some characteristics with retroviruses have also recently been observed in prokaryotes. Because of the apparent relationship between retroviruses and retrotransposons, this chapter discusses of retrotransposons as well as retroviruses. Though all retroviruses utilize translational suppression in pol-protein synthesis, different groups of retroviruses use two completely distinct types of translational suppression. One of these is in-frame or readthrough suppression and the other is ribosomal frameshifting.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatfield, Dolph L.; Levin, Judith G.; Rein, Alan; Oroszlan, Stephen","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131785/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different groups of retroviruses","readthrough suppression","distinct types of translational suppression","chromosomal DNA","viral DNA","termed retrotransposons","Elements","chapter","unique class of viruses","pol-protein synthesis","present state of knowledge","man","flow of information","subsequent integration","striking similarities","variety of neoplastic diseases","infectious process","causative agents","AIDS","immunodeficiency syndrome","domestic animals","RNA","yeast","distinctive properties","eukaryotes","host cell","characteristics","apparent relationship","ribosomal frameshifting","similar mechanisms","classes of vertebrates","organisms","prokaryotes"],"language":"en"},

To obtain information on the receptor binding site(s) several synthetic peptides derived from Ad2 and Ad3 fiber head sequences and their antisera were tested for interference with virus attachment to HeLa and FL cells and cell adhesion to viruses. The anti-peptide sera were also evaluated in ELISA and virus neutralisation test. Ad2 (of subgroup C) and Ad3 (of subgroup B) attachment was not significantly inhibited by peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 535\u2013554, 555\u2013573, 562\u2013582 of Ad2 fiber or 210\u2013225, 267\u2013283, 291\u2013306 and 300\u2013319 of Ad3 fiber. However, microplate pre-adsorbed Ad3 fiber residues 210\u2013225 and 267\u2013283 could bind FL and HeLa cells, and 1 mg/ml of Ad3 fiber residues 267\u2013283 inhibited the cell adhesion to Ad3 virus to approximately 90%. This peptide may participate in the receptor binding site of Ad3 fiber. ELISA reactive anti-peptide antibodies against the homologous peptide and virus did not significantly reduce the cell adhesion to the immobilised virus or the virus attachment to cells, but in the neutralisation assay antibodies raised to Ad2 fiber residues 555\u2013573 and 562\u2013582 and Ad3 fiber residues 210\u2013225 caused neutralisation of the homologous virus at serum dilutions of 1:500 and 1:32, respectively.

Five respiratory pathogenic viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were used as inducers. Cells from every child responded to at least three out of the six inducers by interferon production. As a group, cultures prepared from patient cells showed decreased production of IFN when stimulated with adeno, rhino, corona or RS viruses or with the mycoplasma. Similar trend between the two groups of children was seen as regards influenza A virus induced IFN production in leukocyte cultures. These results corroborate our previous findings that relative deficiency in interferon production appears to be inducer-specific, and suggest that this phenomenon may have a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2002-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pitk\u00E4ranta, Anne; Karma, Pekka; Hovi, Tapani","journal":"Clin Diagn Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozg5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interferon production","decreased production of IFN","virus induced IFN production","patient cells","pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections","respiratory pathogenic viruses","groups of children","healthy children","inducers","recurrent upper respiratory tract infections","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","leukocyte cultures","RS viruses","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","previous findings","relative deficiency","rhino","adeno","influenza","corona","role","results","inducer-specific","Similar trend","phenomenon"],"language":"en"},

Subsequent work on the protein map of BVDV and polyprotein processing pathways paved the way for the interpretation of many other virologic and immunologic studies. Discovery of a correlation between genotype II and virulence (hemorrhagic syndrome) will help to clarify previously controversial data and to improve disease control. Description of multiple pathways of p80 expression in CP-BVDV offered insight into the pathogenesis of mucosal disease. Identification of gp53/E2 as the target of neutralizing antibodies and source of antigenic hypervariability helped us to understand immunity to BVDV.

Onset of resistance normally becomes evident by the 10th day when inoculation is made with 10(6) pfu or less. The resistance could be abrogated in 15 day old animals by increasing the dose two-fold, but with rare exceptions, in 35 day old rats an 80-fold increase in pfu fails to surmount resistance. However, treatment with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) abolished resistance, whereby rats challenged at 35 days of age were susceptible to JHMV. The histopathological evidence and disease symptoms in the CsA treated group resembled closely those observed in our previous study with athymic, nude rats. Microscopic examination of the CNS from untreated, infected rats revealed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by perivascular cuffing and mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile. The parallel CsA treated group showed that inflammatory responses of this type in the CNS were either minimal or absent. From the present evidence, we conclude that JHMV infection, which involves both neuronal and oligodendrocytic elements, is kept in check by the cellular immune system. When cellular immunity is suppressed or absent the disease process is altered from one in which white matter demyelination predominates to another form of disease in which neuronal involvement is prominent.","publish_time":"2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmer, Mitchell J.; Dales, Samuel","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135175/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozk2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["CNS","JHMV","CsA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS disease","day old rats","infected rats","nude rats","form of disease","disease symptoms","disease process","cellular immunity","Onset of resistance","JHMV infection","parallel CsA","day old animals","present study","group","present evidence","pfu","extensive inflammatory responses","cellular immune system","days of age","fold increase","neuronal involvement","previous study","histopathological evidence","age related effects of inoculum size","perivascular cuffing","Wistar Lewis","JHM virus","check","mononuclear infiltrates","rare exceptions","immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin","athymic","dose","type","WL","white matter demyelination","treatment","neuropile","oligodendrocytic elements","Microscopic examination","inoculation"],"language":"en"},

Substantial reductions in hospitalization could be achieved with smaller antiviral stockpiles if drugs are reserved for persons at high risk.","publish_time":"2005-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gani, Raymond; Hughes, Helen; Fleming, Douglas; Griffin, Thomas; Medlock, Jolyon; Leach, Steve","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44ca543f5528ca4d7b33b401623cc1bf0afb84c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3371825.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3371825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza","pandemic use","smaller antiviral stockpiles","hospitalization rates","Substantial reductions","different antiviral stockpile sizes","pathogenic strains of avian influenza","drugs","neuraminidase inhibitors","persons","infection","countries","treatment available","threat","recent spread","effect","high risk","early phases","clinical cases","population","hospitalizations"],"language":"en"},

The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated.

Despite improvements in detection methods, a significant diagnostic gap still remains. Human bocavirus (HBoV)s, which are associated with respiratory infections, have also frequently been detected in stool samples in cases of gastroenteritis, and a tentative association between HBoVs, and in particular type-2 HBoVs, and gastroenteritis has previously been made. The aim of this study was to determine the role of HBoVs in gastroenteritis, using archived DNA samples from the case-control Infectious Intestinal Disease Study (IID). DNA extracted from stool samples from 2,256 cases and 2,124 controls were tested for the presence of HBoV DNA. All samples were screened in a real time PCR pan-HBoV assay, and positive samples were then tested in genotype 1 to 3-specific assays. HBoV was detected in 7.4% but no significantly different prevalence was observed between cases and controls. In the genotype-specific assays 106 of the 324 HBoV-positive samples were genotyped, with HBoV-1 predominantly found in controls whilst HBoV-2 was more frequently associated with cases of gastroenteritis (p\u003C0.01). A significant proportion of HBoV positives could not be typed using the type specific assays, 67% of the total positives, and this was most likely due to low viral loads being present in the samples. However, the distribution of the untyped HBoV strains was no different between cases and controls. In conclusion, HBoVs, including HBoV-2 do not appear to be a significant cause of gastroenteritis in the UK population.","publish_time":"2012-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nawaz, Sameena; Allen, David J.; Aladin, Farah; Gallimore, Christopher; Iturriza-G\u00F3mara, Miren","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3053729be9dadd6180b0b30ed2048dec12bd0401.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3404102.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404102/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infectious Intestinal Disease Study","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV-positive samples","cases of gastroenteritis","presence of HBoV DNA","stool samples","untyped HBoV strains","significant proportion of HBoV positives","controls","archived DNA samples","significant cause of gastroenteritis","type specific assays","genotype-specific assays","real time PCR pan-HBoV assay","role of HBoVs","significant diagnostic gap","particular type","different prevalence","total positives","case-control Infectious Intestinal Disease Study","IID","detection methods","common illness","considerable morbidity","mortality","tentative association","low viral loads","UK population","improvements","Human bocavirus","distribution","conclusion","respiratory infections","aim"],"language":"en"},

However, to use this type of data for such purposes it has to be transformed into a coded format to make it computable. Because the cause of death in the certificates is reported as free text, encoding the data is currently the single largest barrier of using death certificates for surveillance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a pipeline, composed of a detection rule and a natural language processor, for the real time encoding of death certificates using the identification of pneumonia and influenza cases as an example and demonstrating that its accuracy is comparable to existing methods. RESULTS: A Death Certificates Pipeline (DCP) was developed to automatically code death certificates and identify pneumonia and influenza cases. The pipeline used MetaMap to code death certificates from the Utah Department of Health for the year 2008. The output of MetaMap was then accessed by detection rules which flagged pneumonia and influenza cases based on the Centers of Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition. The output from the DCP was compared with the current method used by the CDC and with a keyword search. Recall, precision, positive predictive value and F-measure with respect to the CDC method were calculated for the two other methods considered here. The two different techniques compared here with the CDC method showed the following recall/ precision results: DCP: 0.998/0.98 and keyword searching: 0.96/0.96. The F-measure were 0.99 and 0.96 respectively (DCP and keyword searching). Both the keyword and the DCP can run in interactive form with modest computer resources, but DCP showed superior performance. CONCLUSION: The pipeline proposed here for coding death certificates and the detection of cases is feasible and can be extended to other conditions. This method provides an alternative that allows for coding free-text death certificates in real time that may increase its utilization not only in the public health domain but also for biomedical researchers and developers.

In addition to cochlear structures, there is strong expression of alpha7GFP by cells of the central auditory pathways including the ventral posterior cochlear nucleus, lateral lemniscus, central inferior colliculus, and the medial geniculate nucleus.

Currently, little is known about the nature of the immune response stimulated by the presence of these cysts or how they are able to propagate. Here we establish a novel chitinase-dependent mechanism of cyst control in the infected brain. Despite a dominant Th1 immune response during Toxoplasma infection there exists a population of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM\u00D8) in the infected CNS. These cells are capable of cyst lysis via the production of AMCase as revealed by live imaging, and this chitinase is necessary for protective immunity within the CNS.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the imaging findings of patients with documented H1N1 infection referred to our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (16 men) with documented H1N1 infection were included in our study. The initial radiography obtained from the patients was reviewed regarding pattern (consolidation, ground glass, nodules and reticulation), distribution (focal, multifocal, and diffuse) and the lung zones involved. Computed tomography (CT) scans were also reviewed for the same abnormalities. The patient files were studied for their possible underlying diseases. RESULTS: The mean age was 37.97 \u00B1 13.9 years. Seventeen (54.8%) patients had co-existing condition (eight respiratory, five cardiovascular, two immunodeficiency, two cancer, four others). Twelve (38.7%) patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Five (16.1%) patients died. (25.8%) had normal initial radiographs. The most common abnormality was consolidation (12/31; 38.7%) in the peripheral region (11/31; 35.5%) followed by peribronchovascular areas (10/31; 32.3%) which was most commonly observed in the lower zone. The patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have two or more lung zones involved (P = 0.005).

Isolation of antibodies by the hybridoma technology is a cumbersome process with fewer yields. Further, the loss of unstable or slowly growing clones which may have unique binding specificities often occurs during cloning and propagation and the strongly positive clones are often lost. This has been avoided by the process described in this paper, wherein, by combining the strategy of EBV transformation and recombinant DNA technology, we constructed human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) against the third variable region (V3) of the clade C HIV-1 envelope. RESULTS: An antigen specific phage library of 7000 clones was constructed from the enriched V3- positive antibody secreting EBV transformed cells. By ligation of the digested scFv DNA into phagemid vector and bio panning against the HIV-1 consensus C and B V3 peptides followed by random selection of 40 clones, we identified 15 clones that showed V3 reactivity in phage ELISA. DNA fingerprinting analysis and sequencing showed that 13 out of the 15 clones were distinct. Expression of the positive clones was tested by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. All the 13 anti-V3 scFvs showed cross-reactivity against both the clade C and B V3 peptides and did not show any reactivity against other unrelated peptides in ELISA. Preliminary neutralization assays indicated varying degrees of neutralization of clade C and B viruses. EBV transformation, followed by antigen selection of lines to identify specific binders, enabled the selection of phage from un-cloned lines for scFv generation, thus avoiding the problems of hybridoma technology. Moreover, as the clones were pretested for antigen binding, a comparatively small library sufficed for the selection of a considerable number of unique antigen binding phage. After selection, the phage clones were propagated in a clonal manner. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy can be efficiently used and is cost effective for the generation of diverse recombinant antibodies. This is the first study to generate anti-V3 scFvs against HIV-1 Clade C.","publish_time":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Rajesh; Andrabi, Raiees; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Prakash, Somi Sankaran; Wig, Naveet; Dutta, Durgashree; Sankhyan, Anurag; Khan, Lubina; Sinha, Subrata; Luthra, Kalpana","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef64fa65c77a221698f7cf13acdcf801ed2d554b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3536577.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3536577/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Clade C."],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phage clones","positive clones","V3 reactivity","selection of phage","growing clones","B V3 peptides","anti-V3 scFvs","clade C HIV","antigen selection of lines","phage ELISA","antigen specific phage library","random selection","recombinant DNA technology","considerable number of unique antigen binding phage","enriched V3- positive antibody secreting EBV","consensus C","Isolation of antibodies","strategy of EBV transformation","generation of diverse recombinant antibodies","digested scFv DNA","scFv generation","unique binding specificities","Production of human monoclonal antibodies","B viruses","cross-reactivity","problems of hybridoma technology","unrelated peptides","DNA fingerprinting analysis","specific binders","small library","variable region","cumbersome process","human single chain variable fragments","varying degrees of neutralization","Preliminary neutralization assays","un-cloned lines","phagemid vector","cloning","bio","SDS-PAGE","neutralizing activity","BACKGROUND","cells","propagation","RESULTS","fewer yields","Western blot","sequencing","ligation","loss of unstable","study","envelope","clonal manner","infection","Expression","CONCLUSIONS","paper","date"],"language":"en"},

Probiotic microorganisms and other health improving food supplements have been given increasing attention in recent years, but, no information on the effects of probiotics on swine influenza virus is available. Here we address this question by assessing the inhibitory potential of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (E. faecium) on the replication of two porcine strains of influenza virus (H1N1 and H3N2 strain) in a continuous porcine macrophage cell line (3D4/21) and in MDBK cells. Cell cultures were treated with E. faecium at the non-toxic concentration of 1\u00D710(6) CFU/ml in growth medium for 60 to 90 min before, during and after SwIV infection. After further incubation of cultures in probiotic-free growth medium, cell viability and virus propagation were determined at 48 h or 96 h post infection. The results obtained reveal an almost complete recovery of viability of SwIV infected cells and an inhibition of virus multiplication by up to four log units in the E. faecium treated cells. In both 3D4/21- and MDBK-cells a 60 min treatment with E. faecium stimulated nitric oxide (NO) release which is in line with published evidence for an antiviral function of NO. Furthermore, E. faecium caused a modified cellular expression of selected mediators of defence in 3D4-cells: while the expression of TNF-\u03B1, TLR-3 and IL-6 were decreased in the SwIV-infected and probiotic treated cells, IL-10 was found to be increased. Since we obtained experimental evidence for the direct adsorptive trapping of SwIV through E. faecium, this probiotic microorganism inhibits influenza viruses by at least two mechanisms, direct physical interaction and strengthening of innate defence at the cellular level.","publish_time":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zhenya; Chai, Weidong; Burwinkel, Michael; Twardziok, Sven; Wrede, Paul; Palissa, Christiane; Esch, Bettina; Schmidt, Michael F.

Nine cases of diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the gravid uterus have been reported, most of which diffusely involved the myometrium. These vascular malformations are clinically significant, and may cause pronounced bleeding resulting in maternal or fetal demise. Thrombosis of cavernous hemangiomas of the uterus has been previously reported. We here report the first case in which a thrombosed cavernous hemangioma of the myometrium resulted in a fatal pulmonary embolism in a post-partum woman. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old obese African-American woman who had one pregnancy and was delivered of twins by cesarean section was admitted 1 week after the successful delivery. The 12-day clinical course included ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, systemic hypertension, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum, leukocytosis and asystole. A transabdominal ultrasound examination showed heterogeneous thickened and irregular products in the endometrial canal. The laboratory values were relevant for an increased prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, ferritin and a decrease in hemoglobin. The clinical cause of death was cited as acute respiratory distress syndrome. At autopsy, a 400g spongy, hemorrhagic uterus with multiple cystic spaces measuring approximately 0.5 \u00D7 0.4cm filled with thrombi within the myometrium was identified. Immunohistological examination with a CD31 stain for vascular endothelium associated antigen confirmed several endothelium-lined vessels, some of which contained thrombi. These histological features were consistent with cavernous hemangioma of the myometrium. A histological examination of the lungs revealed multiple fresh thromboemboli in small- and medium-sized pulmonary arteries in the right upper and lower lobes without organization, but with adjacent areas of fresh hemorrhagic infarction. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion in a pregnant or post-partum woman presenting with respiratory symptoms. Thrombosis of the cavernous hemangiomas of the gravid or post-partum uterus is a rare entity. This case is of interest because it indicates that this condition can be fatally complicated by embolization of the thrombi in the cavernous myometrial hemangiomas. Although delivery by conservative methods, as well as cesarean section, is possible without resorting to hysterectomy, occasionally, the consequences could be fatal as in this case.","publish_time":"2012-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhavsar, Tapan; Wurzel, John; Duker, Nahum","journal":"J Med Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4bb401840392d9be7bd9f2b5215fb219957d4f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3543180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Thrombosis of cavernous hemangiomas","cavernous myometrial hemangiomas","myometrium","post-partum uterus","thrombosed cavernous hemangioma","hemorrhagic uterus","gravid uterus","post-partum woman","cases of diffuse cavernous hemangioma","CASE PRESENTATION","vascular endothelium","respiratory symptoms","Immunohistological examination","vascular malformations","cesarean section","rare benign vascular lesions","multiple fresh thromboemboli","fatal pulmonary embolism","transabdominal ultrasound examination","clinical cause of death","ventilator-dependent respiratory failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","rare entity","histological features","successful delivery","adjacent areas of fresh hemorrhagic infarction","year-old obese African-American woman","increased prothrombin time","partial thromboplastin time","multiple cystic spaces","day clinical course","endothelium-lined vessels","medium-sized pulmonary arteries","systemic hypertension","antigen","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","irregular products","organization","CD31 stain","lungs","g spongy","sputum","lower lobes","ferritin","high index of suspicion","importance","pronounced bleeding","leukocytosis","decrease","week","embolization","fetal demise","laboratory values","endometrial canal","conservative methods","pregnancy","twins","INTRODUCTION","hysterectomy","condition","asystole","hemoglobin","autopsy","consequences","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern based on digital high-speed videomicroscopy analysis has been proposed in the diagnosis process of PCD. Although this evaluation is easy in typical cases, it becomes difficult when ciliary beating is partially maintained. We postulated that a quantitative analysis of beat pattern would improve PCD diagnosis. We compared quantitative parameters with the qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern in patients in whom the diagnosis of PCD was confirmed or excluded. METHODS: Nasal nitric oxide measurement, nasal brushings and biopsies were performed prospectively in 34 patients with suspected PCD. In combination with qualitative analysis, 12 quantitative parameters of ciliary beat pattern were determined on high-speed videomicroscopy recordings of beating ciliated edges. The combination of ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities on transmission electron microscopy analysis with low nasal nitric oxide levels was the \u201Cgold standard\u201D used to establish the diagnosis of PCD. RESULTS: This \u201Cgold standard\u201D excluded PCD in 15 patients (non-PCD patients), confirmed PCD in 10 patients (PCD patients) and was inconclusive in 9 patients. Among the 12 parameters, the distance traveled by the cilium tip weighted by the percentage of beating ciliated edges presented 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis were concordant in non-PCD patients. In 9/10 PCD patients, quantitative analysis was concordant with the \u201Cgold standard\u201D, while the qualitative evaluation was discordant with the \u201Cgold standard\u201D in 3/10 cases. Among the patients with an inconclusive \u201Cgold standard\u201D, the use of quantitative parameters supported PCD diagnosis in 4/9 patients (confirmed by the identification of disease-causing mutations in one patient) and PCD exclusion in 2/9 patients. CONCLUSIONS: When the beat pattern is normal or virtually immotile, the qualitative evaluation is adequate to study ciliary beating in patients suspected for PCD. However, when cilia are still beating but with moderate alterations (more than 40% of patients suspected for PCD), quantitative analysis is required to precise the diagnosis and can be proposed to select patients eligible for TEM.","publish_time":"2012-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papon, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Bassinet, Laurence; Cariou-Patron, Gwena\u00EBlle; Zerah-Lancner, Francoise; Vojtek, Anne-Marie; Blanchon, Sylvain; Crestani, Bruno; Amselem, Serge; Coste, Andre; Housset, Bruno; Escudier, Estelle; Louis, Bruno","journal":"Orphanet J Rare Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a65ed49e9217467923e8db733109be6e54b0bd09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3562218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3562218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-PCD patients","PCD diagnosis","diagnosis of PCD","suspected PCD","PCD exclusion","patients eligible","diagnosis process of PCD","qualitative analysis","ciliary beating","quantitative analysis of beat pattern","Qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern","quantitative parameters of ciliary beat pattern","gold standard","use of quantitative parameters","abnormal ciliary motility","Primary ciliary dyskinesia","digital high-speed videomicroscopy analysis","combination of ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities","transmission electron microscopy analysis","Nasal nitric oxide measurement","nasal brushings","ciliated edges","low nasal nitric oxide levels","high-speed videomicroscopy recordings","typical cases","rare congenital respiratory disorder","biopsies","chronic airway infections","percentage","METHODS","BACKGROUND","identification of disease-causing mutations","cilium tip","sensitivity","distance","TEM","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","moderate alterations","specificity"],"language":"en"},

One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population\u0027s contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R(0), epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population\u0027s unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R(0), turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.","publish_time":"2013-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stack, J.

HCV is an important cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to the need for liver transplantation. In this study, curcumin, a constituent used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been evaluated for its anti-HCV activity and mechanism, using a human hepatoma cell line containing the HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon. Below the concentration of 20% cytotoxicity, curcumin dose-dependently inhibited HCV replication by luciferase reporter gene assay, HCV RNA detection and HCV protein analysis. Under the same conditions, curcumin also dose-dependently induced heme oxygenase-1 with the highest induction at 24 h. Hemin, a heme oxygenase-1 inducer, also inhibited HCV protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. The knockdown of heme oxygenase-1 partially reversed the curcumin-inhibited HCV protein expression. In addition to the heme oxygenase-1 induction, signaling molecule activities of AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) were inhibited by curcumin. Using specific inhibitors of PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK and NF-\u03BAB, the results suggested that only PI3K-AKT inhibition is positively involved in curcumin-inhibited HCV replication. Inhibition of ERK and NF-\u03BAB was likely to promote HCV protein expression. In summary, curcumin inhibited HCV replication by heme oxygenase-1 induction and AKT pathway inhibition. Although curcumin also inhibits ERK and NF-\u03BAB activities, it slightly increased the HCV protein expression. This result may provide information when curcumin is used as an adjuvant in anti-HCV therapy.","publish_time":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHEN, MING-HO; LEE, MING-YANG; CHUANG, JING-JING; LI, YI-ZHEN; NING, SIN-TZU; CHEN, JUNG-CHOU; LIU, YI-WEN","journal":"Int J Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70fefc54856d09f01cb983932a860dc4dacb9f46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3573749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["h.

In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKC\u03B5/JNK/c-Jun and PKC\u03B1/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN-\u03B1 signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.","publish_time":"2013-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yanni; Chen, Junbo; Wang, Hui; Shi, Jingjing; Wu, Kailang; Liu, Shi; Liu, Yingle; Wu, Jianguo","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a98026855729dd7aa175ca9ed534a73c7fd9a84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3635988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","HCV replication","HCV-triggered type","HCV-induced type","HCV-mediated activation of miR","IFN production","IFN-\u03B1","recognition of viral components","MyD88","IRAK1","pathways","hepatitis C virus","pattern recognition receptors","c-Fos cascades","viral proteins","transcription factor","myeloid differentiation factor","inappropriate cellular response","retinoic acid-inducible gene","TLRs","novel mechanism","interleukin","important factors","ERK","PKC\u03B1","expression","JNK","PKC\u03B5","induction","potential therapeutic target","receptor-associated kinase","antiviral intervention","host","viruses","targets","immune surveillance system","toll","interferon","turn","proinflammatory cytokines","microRNA","helicases","study","cells","results"],"language":"en"},

We are now looking for ways to improve the vaccination strategy and enhance protection. One limitation of homologous vaccinations (sequential doses of the same vector) is induction of anti-vector immune response that blocks cell transduction, restricts transgene expression and, consequently, compromises the overall outcome of vaccination. One way to avert the effects of anti-vector response is to use different viruses in prime and boost (heterologous vaccination). Bearing this in mind, we generated a modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara encoding SAG1 (MVASAG1), to be tested as boost agent after prime with AdSAG1. Although minor differences were observed in the magnitude of the anti-SAG1 immune response induced by each vaccination protocol, the heterologous immunization with AdSAG1 followed by MVASAG1 resulted in improved capacity to control brain cyst formation in a model of chronic toxoplasmosis in C57BL/6 mice.","publish_time":"2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendes, \u00C9rica Ara\u00FAjo; Fonseca, Flavio G.; Cas\u00E9rio, B\u00E1rbara M.; Colina, Jana\u00EDna P.; Gazzinelli, Ricardo Tostes; Caetano, Braulia C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fcc000ecf39dd1da69d94d8cd764790ce96aaba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3654925.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-SAG1 immune response","heterologous vaccination","AdSAG1","induction of anti-vector immune response","effects of anti-vector response","vaccination protocol","vaccination strategy","MVASAG1","protein SAG1","overall outcome of vaccination","gondii antigens","heterologous immunization","boost agent","protected mice","model of chronic toxoplasmosis","use of recombinant viral vectors","cell transduction","brain cyst formation","magnitude","different viruses","improved capacity","efficient approach","modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara","sequential doses","parasite","valuable tool","limitation of homologous vaccinations","animals","C57BL","adenovirus","vaccine development","transgene expression","minor differences","mind","ways","protection"],"language":"en"},

Despite the obvious clinical implications associated with the presence of circulating RNA, its pathological effects on endothelial cells and the governing molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. We analyzed the effects of double stranded RNA on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs). The effect of natural and synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) on hPAECs was investigated using trans-endothelial electric resistance, molecule trafficking, calcium (Ca(2\u002B)) homeostasis, gene expression and proliferation studies. Furthermore, the morphology and mechanical changes of the cells caused by synthetic dsRNA was followed by in-situ atomic force microscopy, by vascular-endothelial cadherin and F-actin staining. Our results indicated that exposure of hPAECs to synthetic dsRNA led to functional deficits. This was reflected by morphological and mechanical changes and an increase in the permeability of the endothelial monolayer. hPAECs treated with synthetic dsRNA accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the proliferation rate of the cells in the presence of synthetic dsRNA was significantly decreased. Furthermore, we found that natural and synthetic dsRNA modulated Ca(2\u002B) signaling in hPAECs by inhibiting the sarco-endoplasmic Ca(2\u002B)-ATPase (SERCA) which is involved in the regulation of the intracellular Ca(2\u002B) homeostasis and thus cell growth. Even upon synthetic dsRNA stimulation silencing of SERCA3 preserved the endothelial monolayer integrity.

In addition to using sumoylation to regulate their own proteins, several viral pathogens have been shown to modulate overall host sumoylation levels. Given the large number of cellular targets for SUMO addition and the breadth of critical cellular processes that are regulated via sumoylation, viral modulation of overall sumoylation presumably alters the cellular environment to ensure that it is favorable for viral reproduction and/or persistence. Like some viruses, certain bacterial plant pathogens also target the sumoylation system, usually decreasing sumoylation to disrupt host anti-pathogen responses. The recent demonstration that Listeria monocytogenes also disrupts host sumoylation, and that this is required for efficient infection, extends the plant pathogen observations to a human pathogen and suggests that pathogen modulation of host sumoylation may be more widespread than previously appreciated.

JEV NS1-specific antibody responses could be a target in the differential diagnosis of different flavivirus infections. However, the epitopes on JEV NS1 are poorly characterized. The present study describes the full mapping of linear B-cell epitopes in JEV NS1. We generated eleven NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with recombinant NS1. For epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies, a set of 51 partially-overlapping peptides covering the entire NS1 protein were expressed with a GST-tag and then screened using monoclonal antibodies. Through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), five linear epitope-containing peptides were identified. By sequentially removing amino acid residues from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptides, the minimal units of the five linear epitopes were identified and confirmed using monoclonal antibodies. Five linear epitopes are located in amino acids residues (5)AIDITRK(11), (72)RDELNVL(78), (251)KSKHNRREGY(260), (269)DENGIVLD(276), and (341)DETTLVRS(348). Furthermore, it was found that the epitopes are highly conserved among JEV strains through sequence alignment. Notably, none of the homologous regions on NS1 proteins from other flaviviruses reacted with the MAbs when they were tested for cross-reactivity, and all five epitope peptides were not recognized by sera against West Nile virus or Dengue virus. These novel virus-specific linear B-cell epitopes of JEV NS1 would benefit the development of new vaccines and diagnostic assays.","publish_time":"2013-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Rong-Hong; Liu, Li-Ke; Chen, Zhen-Shi; Li, Ye-Nan; Bu, Zhi-Gao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11a3797796973b32b0763f8127b908f4783e5734.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3688998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3688998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["linear epitopes","NS1 proteins","recombinant NS1","NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies","novel virus-specific linear B-cell epitopes of JEV NS1","JEV NS1-specific antibody responses","entire NS1 protein","JEV strains","epitope peptides","mapping of linear B-cell epitopes","epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies","Dengue virus","virus replication","amino terminal of peptides","West Nile virus","Japanese encephalitis virus","amino acids residues","amino acid residues","non-structural protein","protective immune responses","target","ELISA","sera","mice","minimal units","development of new vaccines","differential diagnosis of different flavivirus infections","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","diagnostic assays","sequence alignment","flaviviruses","set","homologous regions","AIDITRK","GST-tag","cross-reactivity","present study","MAbs","RDELNVL","KSKHNRREGY","DENGIVLD","DETTLVRS"],"language":"en"},

Funding providers, researchers and policymakers rely on the best available evidence to strategically plan programs, new research directions and interventions. We aimed to describe the current landscape of recent pneumonia etiology studies in children under 5 years of age in the developed and developing world, as ascertained by a literature review of relevant studies with data since the year 2000 and a survey of researchers in the field of childhood pneumonia. We collected information on the study population, study design, case definitions, laboratory samples and methods and identified pathogens. A literature review identified 88 studies with child pneumonia etiology results. As of June 2010, our survey of researchers identified an additional 65 ongoing and recently completed child pneumonia etiology studies. This demonstrates the broad existing context into which the PERCH study must be placed. However, the landscape analysis also reveals a multiplicity of case definitions, levels of clinician involvement, facility types, specimen collection, and laboratory techniques.

In this case study, we repeatedly sampled a mammalian wildlife host known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens (the Indian Flying Fox, Pteropus giganteus) and used PCR with degenerate viral family-level primers to discover and analyze the occurrence patterns of 55 viruses from nine viral families. We then adapted statistical techniques used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants and estimated the total viral richness of these nine families in P. giganteus to be 58 viruses. Our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept of a strategy for estimating viral richness and provide the first statistically supported estimate of the number of undiscovered viruses in a mammalian host. We used a simple extrapolation to estimate that there are a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses awaiting discovery within these nine families, assuming all species harbor a similar number of viruses, with minimal turnover between host species. We estimate the cost of discovering these viruses to be ~$6.3 billion (or ~$1.4 billion for 85% of the total diversity), which if annualized over a 10-year study time frame would represent a small fraction of the cost of many pandemic zoonoses.","publish_time":"2013-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anthony, Simon J.; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Murray, Kris A.; Navarrete-Macias, Isamara; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos M.; Solovyov, Alexander; Ojeda-Flores, Rafael; Arrigo, Nicole C.; Islam, Ariful; Ali Khan, Shahneaz; Hosseini, Parviez; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Olival, Kevin J.; Sanchez-Leon, Maria D.; Karesh, William B.; Goldstein, Tracey; Luby, Stephen P.; Morse, Stephen S.; Mazet, Jonna A.

This process involves rearrangement and destruction of actin filaments, while microtubules become protected throughout the infection. Here the focus is on the intracellular egress pathway, as well as its impact on the properties and release of progeny virions. By colocalization with cellular marker proteins and specific modulation of the pathways through over-expression of variant effector genes transduced by recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors, we show that progeny PV particles become engulfed into COPII-vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported through the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Besides known factors like sar1, sec24, rab1, the ERM family proteins, radixin and moesin play (an) essential role(s) in the formation/loading and targeting of virus-containing COPII-vesicles. These proteins also contribute to the transport through ER and Golgi of the well described analogue of cellular proteins, the secreted Gaussia luciferase in absence of virus infection. It is therefore likely that radixin and moesin also serve for a more general function in cellular exocytosis. Finally, parvovirus egress via ER and Golgi appears to be necessary for virions to gain full infectivity through post-assembly modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). While not being absolutely required for cytolysis and progeny virus release, vesicular transport of parvoviruses through ER and Golgi significantly accelerates these processes pointing to a regulatory role of this transport pathway.","publish_time":"2013-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00E4r, S\u00E9verine; Rommelaere, Jean; N\u00FCesch, J\u00FCrg P.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sample from the BV patient underwent total RNA extraction, followed by physical subtraction of human rRNA and whole transcriptome amplification. The metatranscriptome was sequenced using Roche 454 titanium chemistry. The bioinformatics pipeline MG-RAST and desktop DNA analysis platforms were utilised to analyse results. Bacteria of the genus Prevotella (predominately P. amnii) constituted 36% of the 16S rRNA reads, followed by Megasphaera (19%), Leptotrichia/Sneathia (8%) and Fusobacterium (8%). Comparison of the abundances of several bacteria to quantitative PCR (qPCR) screening of extracted DNA revealed comparable relative abundances. This suggests a correlation between what was present and transcriptionally active in this sample: however distinct differences were seen when compared to the microbiome determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. To assess the presence of P. amnii in a larger pool of samples, 90 sexually active women were screened using qPCR. This bacterium was found to be strongly associated with BV (P\u003C0.001, OR 23.3 (95%CI:2.9\u2013190.7)) among the 90 women. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlighted the potential of metatranscriptomics as a tool for characterising metabolically active microbiota and identifying targets for further screening.

The vector potential of the other serotypes was unknown. In the present study, we evaluated nine different biologically- or recombinantly-derived APMV strains for the ability to replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaque model. Five of the viruses were: biologically-derived wild type (wt) APMV-2, -3, -5, -7 and -9. Another virus was a recombinant (r) version of wt APMV-4. The remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4 and -7 in which the F cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic. Rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease, virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and seroconversion. Virus shedding was not detected for wt APMV-5. Very limited shedding was detected for wt rAPMV-4 and modified rAPMV-4, and only in a subset of animals. Shedding by the other viruses was detected in every infected animal, and usually from both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In particular, shedding over a number of days in every animal was observed for modified rAPMV-2, wt APMV-7, and modified rAPMV-7. Modification of the F protein cleavage site appeared to increase shedding by wt rAPMV-2 and marginally by wt rAPMV-4. All APMVs except wt APMV-5 induced a virus-specific serum antibody response in all infected animals. None of the animals exhibited any clinical disease signs. These results indicate that APMVs 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are competent to infect non-human primates, but are moderately-to-highly restricted, depending on the serotype. This suggests that they are not likely to significantly infect primates in nature, and represent promising attenuated candidates for vector development.","publish_time":"2013-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khattar, Sunil K.; Nayak, Baibaswata; Kim, Shin-Hee; Xiao, Sa; Samal, Sweety; Paldurai, Anandan; Buchholz, Ursula J.; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70943b05f17f2b7620ca6cc063b95ba2d7e8aab3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3794941.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794941/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["version of wt APMV","versions of wt rAPMV","modified rAPMV","Virus shedding","derived APMV strains","limited shedding","Newcastle disease virus","non-human primates","cause disease","infected animals","clinical disease signs","F cleavage site","lower respiratory tract","serotypes","vector development","vector potential","candidate human vaccine vector","subset of animals","APMVs","virus-specific serum antibody response","F protein cleavage site","derived wild type","wild birds","Rhesus macaques","promising attenuated candidates","rhesus macaque model","nature","ability","NDV","Modification","recombinant","seroconversion","Avian paramyxoviruses","number of days","present study","results"],"language":"en"},

We define it as the systematic comparative genomics and aim to develop the methodology. RESULTS: First, we create a method, GenomeFingerprinter, to unambiguously produce a set of three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections, to illustrate the genome fingerprint of a given genome sequence. Second, we develop a set of concepts and tools, and thereby establish a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA). Particularly, we define the total genetic component configuration (TGCC) (including chromosome, plasmid, and phage) for describing a strain as a systematic unit, the universal genome fingerprint map (UGFM) of TGCC for differentiating strains as a universal system, and the systematic comparative genomics (SCG) for comparing a set of genomes crossing genetic components and biological categories. Third, we construct a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. Specifically, we define the geometric center and its geometric mean for a given genome fingerprint map, followed by the Euclidean distance, the differentiate rate, and the weighted differentiate rate to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison. Moreover, we demonstrate the applications through case studies on various genome sequences, giving tremendous insights into the critical issues in microbial genomics and taxonomy. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a method, GenomeFingerprinter, for rapidly computing, geometrically visualizing, intuitively comparing a set of genomes at genome fingerprint level, and hence established a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis, as well as developed a method of quantitative analysis of the outcome dataset. These have set up the methodology of systematic comparative genomics based on the genome fingerprint analysis.","publish_time":"2013-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ai, Yuncan; Ai, Hannan; Meng, Fanmei; Zhao, Lei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c57fb53010f62a669421b0f4894a26e22e0e496c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3812135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3812135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["universal genome fingerprint analysis","genome fingerprint level","set of genome sequences","universal genome fingerprint map","outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis","given genome fingerprint map","given genome sequence","set of genomes","various genome sequences","method of quantitative analysis","set of concepts","methodology of systematic comparative genomics","set of three-dimensional coordinates","genetic components","universal system","microbial genomics","systematic unit","genomes of comparison","TGCC","biological categories","rate","GenomeFingerprinter","geometric mean","total genetic component configuration","three-dimensional plot","geometric center","far divergence","UGFM","tremendous insights","critical issues","large size range","differentiating strains","two-dimensional trajectory projections","case studies","chromosome","taxonomy","applications","SCG","UGFA","Euclidean distance","phage","plasmid","difference","tools","BACKGROUND","attention","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we carried out a targeted siRNA screen of 54 ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) and identified USP25 as a negative regulator of the virus-triggered type I IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression of USP25 inhibited virus-induced activation of IFN-\u03B2, interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB), as well as the phosphorylation of IRF3 and NF-\u03BAB subunit p65. Furthermore, Knockdown of USP25 potentiated virus-induced induction of the IFN-\u03B2. In addition, detailed analysis demonstrated that USP25 cleaved lysine 48- and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo, and its deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity, were dependent on a cysteine residue (Cys178) and a histidine residue (His607). USP25 mutants lacking DUB activity lost the ability to block virus-induced type I IFN to some degree. Mechanistically, USP25 deubiquitinated retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), tumornecrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and TRAF6 to inhibit RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling. Our findings suggest that USP25 is a novel DUB negatively regulating virus-induced type I IFN production.","publish_time":"2013-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Huijuan; Wang, Dang; Fang, Liurong; Zhang, Huan; Luo, Rui; Shang, Min; Ouyang, Chao; Ouyang, Haiping; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/810749401200c77f19d5a7950070e0c2d4d2629e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3832446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-induced type","IFN-\u03B2","virus-triggered type","USP25 mutants","IFN production","Overexpression of USP25 inhibited virus-induced activation of IFN","Knockdown of USP25 potentiated virus-induced induction","USP25 cleaved lysine","receptor-mediated IFN","tumornecrosis factor","DUB activity","interferon regulation factor","receptor-associated factor","novel DUB","induction pathway","nuclear factor-kappa B","phosphorylation of IRF3","NF-\u03BAB subunit p65","histidine residue","cysteine residue","ability","ubiquitin-specific proteases","critical regulatory processes","Cys178","detailed analysis","TNF","retinoic acid-inducible gene","targeted siRNA screen","negative regulator","deubiquitination","USPs","TRAF2","linked polyubiquitin chains","addition","deubiquitinating enzyme","degree","His607","TRAF6","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

The many antiviral functions of the IFN-I include direct suppression of viral replication and activation of the immune response against viruses. In addition to their antiviral effects, IFN-I are also protective against several extracellular bacterial infections, in part, by promoting the induction of TNF-\u03B1 and nitric oxide. In contrast, there is a negative effect of IFN-I on host resistance during chronic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and acute infections with intracellular bacteria. In the case of LCMV, chronic IFN-I signaling induces adaptive immune system suppression. Blockade of IFN-I signaling removes the suppression and allows CD4 T-cell- and IFN-\u03B3-mediated resolution of the infection. During acute intracellular bacterial infection, IFN-I suppress innate immunity by at least two defined mechanisms. During Francisella infection, IFN-I prevent IL-17 upregulation on \u03B3\u03B4 T cells and neutrophil recruitment. Following Listeria infection, IFN-I promote the cell death of macrophages and lymphocytes, which leads to innate immune suppression. These divergent findings for the role of IFN-I on pathogen control emphasize the complexity of the interferons system and force more mechanistic evaluation of its role in pathogenesis. This review evaluates IFN-I during infection with an emphasis on work carried out IFN-I-receptor-deficient mice.","publish_time":"2013-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrero, Javier Antonio","journal":"International Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9af080e7508ef52bd7c9b68cf0bd6136d8ca2c3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3839063.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/intimm/article-pdf/25/12/663/2038704/dxt050.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic IFN","role of IFN","IFN-\u03B3","Blockade of IFN","negative effect of IFN","chronic infection","Francisella infection","Listeria infection","acute intracellular bacterial infection","innate immune suppression","acute infections","viral infections","adaptive immune system suppression","extracellular bacterial infections","direct suppression of viral replication","immune response","interferons system","antiviral effects","antiviral functions","decreased host resistance","CD4 T-cell","potent antiviral agents","case of LCMV","innate immunity","defined mechanisms","\u03B3\u03B4 T cells","cell death of macrophages","activation","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","mechanistic evaluation","force","upregulation","complexity","lymphocytes","neutrophil recruitment","pathogen control","mediated resolution","induction of TNF","nitric oxide","pathogenesis","viruses","divergent findings","addition","emphasis","work","receptor-deficient mice","contrast","review"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: From December 2005 to February 2006 a random sample of 1020 adults received a questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of transmission and prevention about AI, attitudes towards AI, behaviors regarding use of preventive measures and food-handling practices, and sources of information about AI. RESULTS: A response rate of 67% was achieved. Those in higher socioeconomic classes were more likely to identify the modes of transmission and the animals\u0027 vehicles for AI. Those older, who knew the modes of transmission and the animals\u0027 vehicles for AI, and who still need information, were more likely to know that washing hands soap before and after touching raw poultry meat and using gloves is recommended to avoid spreading of AI through food.

Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time.","publish_time":"2008-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bettencourt, Lu\u00EDs M.

Alterations in cell metabolism as well as side-effects of antiviral responses contribute to symptoms development and virulence. Sometimes, a virus may spill over from its usual host species into a novel one, where usually will fail to successfully infect and further transmit to new host. However, in some cases, the virus transmits and persists after fixing beneficial mutations that allow for a better exploitation of the new host. This situation would represent a case for a new emerging virus. Here we report results from an evolution experiment in which a plant virus was allowed to infect and evolve on a na\u00EFve host. After 17 serial passages, the viral genome has accumulated only five changes, three of which were non-synonymous. An amino acid substitution in the viral VPg protein was responsible for the appearance of symptoms, whereas one substitution in the viral P3 protein the epistatically contributed to exacerbate severity. DNA microarray analyses show that the evolved and ancestral viruses affect the global patterns of host gene expression in radically different ways. A major difference is that genes involved in stress and pathogen response are not activated upon infection with the evolved virus, suggesting that selection has favored viral strategies to escape from host defenses.","publish_time":"2008-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agudelo-Romero, Patricia; Carbonell, Pablo; Perez-Amador, Miguel A.; Elena, Santiago F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ace931a12cf4c36b131fcf16b49bf36eb15f8e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2398778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2398778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new host","evolved virus","host defenses","na\u00EFve host","plant virus","new emerging virus","usual host species","viral genome","viral strategies","viral VPg protein","viral P3 protein","global patterns of host gene expression","cellular metabolism","appearance of symptoms","symptoms development","ancestral viruses","cell metabolism","amino acid substitution","genes","evading defense mechanisms","side-effects of antiviral responses","better exploitation","stress","pathogen response","hosts","evolution experiment","different ways","infection","selection","DNA microarray analyses","virulence","beneficial mutations","severity","changes","serial passages","major difference","results","Alterations","benefit","situation","cases"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly the codon usages between begomoviruses from the Old and the New Worlds are apparently different, which supports the idea that the bipartite begomoviruses of the New World might originate from bipartite ones of the Old World, whereas the latter evolve from the Old World monopartite begomoviruses.","publish_time":"2008-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xiao-zhong; Liu, Qing-po; Fan, Long-jiang; Cui, Xiao-feng; Zhou, Xue-ping","journal":"Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb5b202baa650dfcaaf4a1c863b67b2c36e0fd0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2528880.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2528880?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New World"],"keyphrases":["bipartite begomoviruses","Old World monopartite begomoviruses","codon usage bias of AV1","codon usages","protein-coding genes of begomoviruses","synonymous codon usage variations","comparison of codon usage patterns","BV1 genes","bipartite ones","lowly expressed genes","New Worlds","mutation bias","translational optimal ones","severe diseases","single-stranded DNA viruses","major crop plants","expressions","Base composition analysis","current genome sequence analyses","codons","idea"],"language":"en"},

Epitope enhancement can elicit more potent T cell responses and can subsequently lead to a stronger memory pool; however, the molecular basis of such enhancement is unclear. We used the consensus peptide-binding motif for the Major Histocompatibility Complex molecule H-2K(b) to design a heteroclitic version of the mouse hepatitis virus-specific subdominant S598 determinant. We demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution at a secondary anchor residue (Q to Y at position 3) increased the stability of the engineered determinant in complex with H-2K(b). The structural basis for this enhanced stability was associated with local alterations in the pMHC conformation as a result of the Q to Y substitution. Recombinant viruses encoding this engineered determinant primed CTL responses that also reacted to the wildtype epitope with significantly higher functional avidity, and protected against selection of virus mutated at a second CTL determinant and consequent disease progression in persistently infected mice. Collectively, our findings provide a basis for the enhanced immunogenicity of an engineered determinant that will serve as a template for guiding the development of heteroclitic T cell determinants with applications in prevention of CTL escape in chronic viral infections as well as in tumor immunity.","publish_time":"2008-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butler, Noah S.; Theodossis, Alex; Webb, Andrew I.; Nastovska, Roza; Ramarathinam, Sri Harsha; Dunstone, Michelle A.; Rossjohn, Jamie; Purcell, Anthony W.; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daffb9a10450c4d9217cf3819a559c31cd49970c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2563037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CTL determinant","engineered determinant primed CTL responses","potent T cell responses","enhanced stability","Y substitution","molecular basis","Epitope enhancement","structural basis","mouse hepatitis virus-specific subdominant S598 determinant","development of heteroclitic T cell determinants","prevention of CTL escape","protective immune responses","High affinity antigen-specific T cells","heteroclitic version","selection of virus","enhanced immunogenicity","wildtype epitope","Major Histocompatibility Complex molecule H","single amino acid substitution","secondary anchor residue","critical role","applications","consequent disease progression","chronic viral infections","consensus peptide-binding motif","local alterations","result","higher functional avidity","pMHC conformation","Recombinant viruses","infected mice","position","stronger memory pool","template","tumor immunity","findings"],"language":"en"},

Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species. ORMA represents a significant improvement from other contexts where enzyme-based techniques have been employed on already known mutations of a single base or on entire subsequences.","publish_time":"2009-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Severgnini, Marco; Cremonesi, Paola; Consolandi, Clarissa; Caredda, Giada; De Bellis, Gianluca; Castiglioni, Bianca","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67595d2304315ae4af47ec96fbd42c55bd6855e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2760787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ligase Detection Reaction","LDR","ORMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["set of LDR probe pairs","new set of probe pairs","S rRNA sequences","set of scripts","candidate probe pairs","S rRNA gene","cyanobacteria","milk pathogenic-related species","different species","set of homologous ones","Molecular Applications","LDR assay","present ORMA","species phylogenesis issues","microbiological-related contexts","perfect discrimination","single base","identification of single","bovine milk","enzyme-based techniques","selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes","preferred targets","nucleotide variations capable","performance","Ligase Detection Reaction","significant improvement","pathogens","discriminating positions","assays","entire subsequences","dataset","mutations","samples","Results","software","previous study"],"language":"en"},

Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 (\u0022Swine flu\u0022) in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses. METHODS: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148). Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption RESULTS: 26% of the respondents were \u0027very concerned\u0027 about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p \u003C .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p \u003C .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p \u003C .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p \u003C .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p \u003C .001). Groups seen as at \u0027high risk\u0027 of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened. CONCLUSION: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic. Europeans underestimated mortality of seasonal flu, and require more information about the protection given by seasonal flu inoculation.","publish_time":"2009-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodwin, Robin; Haque, Shamsul; Neto, Felix; Myers, Lynn B","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ffa106061fd815e4bb93389274819e640dfb840.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2765446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2765446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["pandemic flu","Swine Flu","mortality of seasonal flu","seasonal flu inoculation","flu victim","mortality rates of seasonal flu","effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination","Particular groups","Influenza","Malaysians","perceived risk groups","respondents","Europeans","pandemic alert level","Initial responses","victimisation of particular population groups","indicators of anxiety","changes","H1N1","estimated mortality rates","protection","attitudinal responses","greater risk","high risk","friends","prostitutes","reduced public transport use","purchase of preparatory goods","large regional differences","existing anxiety levels","boycotting of particular foods","pork consumption RESULTS","stockpiling of goods","transport usage","cancellation of travel","preparatory materials","face masks","paper-based questionnaire study","cross-sectional Internet","health services","infection","family","days","homosexuals","outbreak","information","major challenge","increased prejudice","world","viral drugs","home","Measures","CONCLUSION","Previous pandemics","pig farmers","elderly","Discussions","METHODS","flight cancellations","BACKGROUND","data"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of a group of 26 adult recipients of allogeneic HSCTs was conducted. Serum samples taken before transplant were examined for the presence of specific anti-HHV-6 IgM and IgG antibodies. After transplantation, quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine viral load in plasma samples from days 0\u201380 post-transplant. RESULTS: HHV-6 DNA was detected in plasma samples in 8 (30%) of the 26 recipients between days 18 and 40 after transplantation. All of them developed fever of unknown origin and over 50% had graft-versus-host disease features. Three individuals from this group died during detectable HHV-6 viremia. Another two recipients showed a single positive PCR result at a later time. Infection with HHV-6 was thus confirmed in 10 (38.5%) of the 26 graft recipients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high frequency of detectable HHV-6 viral load in stem cell transplant recipients in Poland. Further investigation to monitor HHV-6 reactivation in graft recipients will be important to improve outcome for these patients.","publish_time":"2008-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dzieci\u0105tkowski, Tomasz; Przybylski, Maciej; Torosian, Tigran; Tomaszewska, Agnieszka; \u0141uczak, Miros\u0142aw","journal":"Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ac1d58169e0874fd6d21618f8c249b3c70ef716.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2766496.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2766496/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graft recipients","stem cell transplant recipients","high frequency of detectable HHV","post-transplant","presence of specific anti-HHV","adult recipients of allogeneic HSCTs","plasma samples","hemopoietic stem cell transplant","viral load","group","days","Serum samples","transplantation","quantitative real-time PCR","fever of unknown origin","single positive PCR result","bone marrow suppression","skin rash","IgM","significant pathogen","reactivation","retrospective review","later time","DNA","Poland","IgG antibodies","MATERIALS","METHODS","encephalitis","host disease features","INTRODUCTION","Human herpesvirus","outcome","Different clinical manifestations","patients","CONCLUSIONS","individuals","RESULTS","investigation","viremia","Infection"],"language":"en"},

Setting Cross sectional population based anonymous survey. Participants Random sample of 301 adults interviewed by telephone (response rate 80%). Main outcome measure Intention to take up vaccination against influenza A/H1N1 under five hypothetical scenarios: vaccination is free; vaccination per dosage costs less than $HK100 (\u00A38; \u20AC9; $13), $HK101-200, or more than $HK200; and no data are available on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Results 45% (n=135) of the participants reported that they would be highly likely take up vaccination if it was free. When vaccination incurred a cost, however, the prevalence of uptake decreased: 36% (n=108) would take up vaccination if it cost less than $HK100, 24% (n=72) if it cost $HK101-200, and 15% (n=45) if it cost more than $HK200; and in absence of proved efficacy and safety decreased to 5% (n=14). Moreover, 32% (n=95) considered universal A/H1N1 vaccination unnecessary. Overall, 39% (n=117) of participants believed that A/H1N1 vaccination would prevent the virus being contracted; 63% (n=189) erroneously believed that efficacy of the vaccine had been confirmed by clinical trials, and 16% (n=49) believed that it is necessary for everyone in Hong Kong to take up vaccination against influenza A/H1N1. Conclusions The uptake of vaccination against influenza A/H1N1 by the general population of Hong Kong is unlikely to be high and would be sensitive to personal cost. Evidence about safety and efficacy is critical in determining the prevalence of uptake of vaccination.","publish_time":"2009-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Joseph T F; Yeung, Nelson C Y; Choi, K C; Cheng, Mabel Y M; Tsui, H Y; Griffiths, Sian","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c64fdedbafa647d17c84faa5a8853c5d824a6f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2768779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["uptake of vaccination","H1N1 vaccination unnecessary","influenza","efficacy","safety","personal cost","general population of Hong Kong","Hong Kong general population","prevalence of uptake","vaccine","HK200","HK100","HK101","Cross sectional population","Participants Random sample","Main outcome measure Intention","adults","hypothetical scenarios","dosage costs","telephone","anonymous survey","response rate","data","Evidence","absence","Conclusions","clinical trials","virus","Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

While uptake per se in most cases does not represent the main obstacle of nucleic acid delivery in vitro, it becomes increasingly apparent that intracellular trafficking is the bottleneck. As a consequence, in order to optimize a given delivery system, a side-by-side analysis of nucleic acid cargo internalized and the corresponding biological effect is required to determine the overall efficacy. In this review, we will concentrate on peptide-mediated delivery of siRNAs and steric block oligonucleotides and discuss different methods for quantitative assessment of the amount of cargo taken up and how to correlate those numbers with biological effects by applying easy to handle reporter systems.

In this process, following translation of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) and termination at the stop codon, a proportion of 40S subunits remain associated with the mRNA and reinitiate at the AUG of a downstream ORF, which is typically in close proximity. Consistent with this, the VP2 start codon (AUG) of MNV overlaps the stop codon of the upstream VP1 ORF (UAA) in the pentanucleotide UAA UG. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we confirm that MNV VP2 expression is regulated by termination-reinitiation and define the mRNA sequence requirements. Efficient reintiation is dependent upon 43 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG site. Chemical and enzymatic probing revealed that the RNA in this region is not highly structured and includes an essential stretch of bases complementary to 18S rRNA helix 26 (Motif 1). The relative position of Motif 1 with respect to the UAA UG site impacts upon the efficiency of the process. Termination-reinitiation in MNV was also found to be relatively insensitive to the initiation inhibitor edeine. CONCLUSIONS: The termination-reinitiation signal of MNV most closely resembles that of influenza BM2. Similar to other viruses that use this strategy, base-pairing between mRNA and rRNA is likely to play a role in tethering the 40S subunit to the mRNA following termination at the VP1 stop codon. Our data also indicate that accurate recognition of the VP2 ORF AUG is not a pre-requisite for efficient reinitiation of translation in this system.","publish_time":"2009-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Napthine, Sawsan; Lever, Robert A.; Powell, Michael L.; Jackson, Richard J.; Brown, T.

METHODS: We searched modeling publications through PubMed and associated references from 1990 to 30 September 2009. Inclusion criteria were modeling papers quantifying the effectiveness of combination strategies, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical. RESULTS: Nineteen modeling papers on combination strategies were selected. Four studies examined combination strategies on a global scale, 14 on single countries, and one on a small community. Stochastic individual-based modeling was used in nine studies, stochastic meta-population modeling in five, and deterministic compartmental modeling in another five. As part of combination strategies, vaccination was explored in eight studies, antiviral prophylaxis and/or treatment in 16, area or household quarantine in eight, case isolation in six, social distancing measures in 10 and air travel restriction in six studies. Two studies suggested a high probability of successful influenza epicenter containment with combination strategies under favorable conditions. During a pandemic, combination strategies delayed spread, reduced overall number of cases, and delayed and reduced peak attack rate more than individual strategies. Combination strategies remained effective at high reproductive numbers compared with single strategy. Global cooperative strategies, including redistribution of antiviral drugs, were effective in reducing the global impact and attack rates of pandemic influenza.

However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated; although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights. Here we present the first quantitative risk assessment to assess the potential for within-flight transmission of H1N1. METHODS: We model airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1 within a Boeing 747 using methodology from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment. RESULTS: The risk of catching H1N1 will essentially be confined to passengers travelling in the same cabin as the source case. Not surprisingly, we find that the longer the flight the greater the number of infections that can be expected. We calculate that H1N1, even during long flights, poses a low to moderate within-flight transmission risk if the source case travels First Class. Specifically, 0-1 infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 1-3 during an 11 hour flight and 2-5 during a 17 hour flight. However, within-flight transmission could be significant, particularly during long flights, if the source case travels in Economy Class. Specifically, two to five infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 5-10 during an 11 hour flight and 7-17 during a 17 hour flight. If the aircraft is only partially loaded, under certain conditions more infections could occur in First Class than in Economy Class. During a 17 hour flight, a greater number of infections would occur in First Class than in Economy if the First Class Cabin is fully occupied, but Economy class is less than 30% full. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights into the potential utility of air travel restrictions on controlling influenza pandemics in the winter of 2009/2010. They show travel by one infectious individual, rather than causing a single outbreak of H1N1, could cause several simultaneous outbreaks. These results imply that, during a pandemic, quarantining passengers who travel in Economy on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy. Notably, our results show that quarantining passengers who travel First Class would be unlikely to be an effective control strategy.","publish_time":"2009-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wagner, Bradley G; Coburn, Brian J; Blower, Sally","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8b5de09c002605e9748e653b5ca827a23e83cf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2813231.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2813231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Boeing","First Class Cabin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hour flight","flight transmission of H1N1","flight transmission risk","Economy Class","Class Cabin","risk of catching H1N1","RESULTS","airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1","long flights","single outbreak of H1N1","greater number of infections","source case travels","quantitative risk assessment","long-haul flights","commercial flights","quarantining passengers","potential utility of air travel restrictions","seasonal influenza","field of quantitative microbial risk assessment","infectious individuals","controlling influenza pandemics","important control strategy","effective control strategy","tuberculosis","SARS","Boeing","methodology","insights","measles","smallpox","geographic location","winter","CONCLUSIONS","certain conditions","METHODS","simultaneous outbreaks","possibility","BACKGROUND","aircraft"],"language":"en"},

We show that, when contact network structure is considered in addition to contact tracing, standard \u201Cmass action\u201D models are generally inadequate. To consider the impact of mutual contacts (specifically clustering) we develop an improvement to existing pairwise network models, which we use to demonstrate that ceteris paribus, clustering improves the efficacy of contact tracing for a large region of parameter space. This result is sometimes reversed, however, for the case of highly effective contact tracing. We also develop stochastic simulations for comparison, using simple re-wiring methods that allow the generation of appropriate comparator networks.

Prediction of a pseudoknotted minimum free energy structure is an NP-complete problem. Practical algorithms for RNA structure prediction including restricted classes of pseudoknots suffer from high runtime and poor accuracy for longer sequences. A heuristic approach is to search for promising pseudoknot candidates in a sequence and verify those. Afterwards, the detected pseudoknots can be further analysed using bioinformatics or laboratory techniques. We present a novel pseudoknot detection method called DotKnot that extracts stem regions from the secondary structure probability dot plot and assembles pseudoknot candidates in a constructive fashion. We evaluate pseudoknot free energies using novel parameters, which have recently become available. We show that the conventional probability dot plot makes a wide class of pseudoknots including those with bulged stems manageable in an explicit fashion. The energy parameters now become the limiting factor in pseudoknot prediction. DotKnot is an efficient method for long sequences, which finds pseudoknots with higher accuracy compared to other known prediction algorithms.

Half of the twelve isolates were similar to the KM91 RFLP pattern, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three more isolates were related to the Arkansas strain pattern, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variant RFLP patterns.

The dependence of viruses on cellular factors provides a weak-spot in the viral multiplication strategy and a means to interfere with viral multiplication. RESULTS: Using a motif-based search strategy for antiviral targets we identified caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a putative cellular interaction partner of human influenza A viruses, including the pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) strains of swine origin circulating from spring 2009 on. The influence of Cav-1 on human influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus replication was determined in inhibition and competition experiments. RNAi-mediated Cav-1 knock-down as well as transfection of a dominant-negative Cav-1 mutant results in a decrease in virus titre in infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), a cell line commonly used in basic influenza research as well as in virus vaccine production. To understand the molecular basis of the phenomenon we focussed on the putative caveolin-1 binding domain (CBD) located in the lumenal, juxtamembranal portion of the M2 matrix protein which has been identified in the motif-based search. Pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that caveolin-1 binds to M2. The data suggest, that Cav-1 modulates influenza virus A replication presumably based on M2/Cav-1 interaction. CONCLUSION: As Cav-1 is involved in the human influenza A virus life cycle, the multifunctional protein and its interaction with M2 protein of human influenza A viruses represent a promising starting point for the search for antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2010-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Lijing; Hemg\u00E5rd, Gun-Viol; Susanto, Sony A; Wirth, Manfred","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8843a16da82f4b658269759cbf5ee1e307fc4fd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2889940.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889940/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","M2 protein of human influenza","pandemic influenza","virus replication","influence of Cav","virus titre","basic influenza research","putative cellular interaction partner of human influenza","dominant-negative Cav","RNAi-mediated Cav","threat of recurring influenza pandemics","motif-based search strategy","virus life cycle","M2 matrix protein","virus vaccine production","putative caveolin","viral multiplication strategy","multifunctional protein","new viral strains","dependence of viruses","H1N1","antiviral targets","cellular factors","mutant results","antiviral agents","competition experiments","strains of swine origin","co-immunoprecipitation experiments","potent therapeutic targets","infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells","MDCK","decrease","occurrence of escape mutants","weak-spot","promising starting point","cell line","juxtamembranal portion","means","Pull-down assays","CBD","lumenal","knock","transfection","phenomenon","binding domain","inhibition","spring","BACKGROUND","binds","molecular basis","data","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

For serodiagnosis of echinococcosis, especially cystic disease, most screening tests rely on crude or purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid. To resolve limitations associated with native antigens in serological tests, the use of standardized and highly pure antigens produced by chemical synthesis offers considerable advantages, provided appropriate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is achieved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Making use of the growing collection of genomic and proteomic data, we applied a set of bioinformatic selection criteria to a collection of protein sequences including conceptually translated nucleotide sequence data of two related tapeworms, Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus. Our approach targeted alpha-helical coiled-coils and intrinsically unstructured regions of parasite proteins potentially exposed to the host immune system. From 6 proteins of E. multilocularis and 5 proteins of E. granulosus, 45 peptides between 24 and 30 amino acids in length were designed. These peptides were chemically synthesized, spotted on microarrays and screened for reactivity with sera from infected humans. Peptides reacting above the cut-off were validated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Peptides identified failed to differentiate between E. multilocularis and E. granulosus infection. The peptide performing best reached 57% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This candidate derived from Echinococcus multilocularis antigen B8/1 and showed strong reactivity to sera from patients infected either with E. multilocularis or E. granulosus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides proof of principle for the discovery of diagnostically relevant peptides by bioinformatic selection complemented with screening on a high-throughput microarray platform. Our data showed that a single peptide cannot provide sufficient diagnostic sensitivity whereas pooling several peptide antigens improved sensitivity; thus combinations of several peptides may lead the way to new diagnostic tests that replace, or at least complement conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis. Our strategy could prove useful for diagnostic developments in other pathogens.","publish_time":"2010-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"List, Claudia; Qi, Weihong; Maag, Eva; Gottstein, Bruno; M\u00FCller, Norbert; Felger, Ingrid","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08174b668145c88e0e719dac2a03b30fb68f5de5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2914747.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2914747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Echinococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relevant peptides","peptide antigens improved sensitivity","appropriate diagnostic sensitivity","sufficient diagnostic sensitivity","proteins of","granulosus infection","Echinococcus multilocularis antigen B8","new diagnostic tests","pure antigens","screening tests","diagnostic developments","Production of native antigens","purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid","serological tests","proteomic data","single peptide","serodiagnosis of echinococcosis","sera","specificity","translated nucleotide sequence data","use of standardized","set of bioinformatic selection criteria","unstructured regions of parasite proteins","strong reactivity","batch variation","infected humans","collection of protein sequences","growing collection of genomic","serodiagnosis of helminthic infections","conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis","related tapeworms","crude","considerable advantages","approach targeted alpha-helical coiled-coils","chemical synthesis","discovery","cystic disease","combinations","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","study","ELISA","proof of principle","high-throughput microarray platform","candidate","patients","way","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","SIGNIFICANCE","host immune system","METHODOLOGY","strategy","pathogens","amino acids","cut-off","BACKGROUND","limitations","CONCLUSIONS","length","microarrays"],"language":"en"},

A new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that the quantity [Image: see text] is a valid predictor in structured populations only when size is infinite. In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on [Image: see text] as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size. CONCLUSION: An epidemiological analysis based on entropy is shown to explain empirical observations regarding the emergence of less pathogenic strains of human influenza during the antigenic drift phase. Furthermore, we exploit the entropy perspective to discuss certain epidemiological patterns of the current H1N1 swine \u0027flu outbreak.","publish_time":"2010-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rhodes, Christopher J.; Demetrius, Lloyd","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e077bb756a7a9e4df0cdcc18f2e1cd509e4a3993.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2944876.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population size","new theory","Standard epidemiological theory claims","epidemiological analysis","entropic selection theory","evolutionary entropy","text","Image","entropy perspective","population of infectives","certain epidemiological patterns","individual strains","standard model","structured populations competition","multiple pathogen strains","dynamics of infection","pathogenic strains of human influenza","stochastic process","duration of infection","deterministic process","empirical study","valid predictor","empirical observations","predictor of success","multi-strain pathogens","information theoretic measure","measure of selective advantage","current H1N1 swine","simulation","uncertainty","emergence","robustness","outcome","limit","demographic stability","approximation","infinity","validity","infected parent","antigenic drift phase","infectious age","flu outbreak","BACKGROUND","basic reproduction number","quantitative index","pathogenicity","statistical parameter","quantity","CONCLUSION","article","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Bortezomib inhibits the activity of the 26S proteasome and induces cell death in a variety of tumor cells; however, the mechanism of cytotoxicity is not well understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the differential phosphoproteome upon proteasome inhibition by using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with phosphoprotein enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis. In total 233 phosphoproteins were identified and 72 phosphoproteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment. The phosphoproteins with expression alterations encompass all major protein classes, including a large number of nucleic acid binding proteins. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser38 phosphorylation on stathmin increased upon bortezomib treatment, suggesting new mechanisms associated to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Further studies demonstrated that stathmin phosphorylation profile was modified in response to bortezomib treatment and the regulation of stathmin by phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr residues participated in the cellular response induced by bortezomib.

A vaccine is greatly needed to prevent this disease. The purpose of this study was to use an immmunosense approach to develop a foundation for development of vaccines to protect humans with the HLA-A03 supertype. Three peptides had been identified with high binding scores for HLA-A03 supertypes using bioinformatic algorhythms, high measured binding affinity for HLA-A03 supertype molecules, and ability to elicit IFN-\u03B3 production by human HLA-A03 supertype peripheral blood CD8(\u002B )T cells from seropositive but not seronegative persons. RESULTS: Herein, when these peptides were administered with the universal CD4(\u002B)T cell epitope PADRE (AKFVAAWTLKAAA) and formulated as lipopeptides, or administered with GLA-SE either alone, or with Pam(2)Cys added, we found we successfully created preparations that induced IFN-\u03B3 and reduced parasite burden in HLA-A*1101(an HLA-A03 supertype allele) transgenic mice. GLA-SE is a novel emulsified synthetic TLR4 ligand that is known to facilitate development of T Helper 1 cell (TH1) responses. Then, so our peptides would include those expressed in tachyzoites, bradyzoites and sporozoites from both Type I and II parasites, we used our approaches which had identified the initial peptides. We identified additional peptides using bioinformatics, binding affinity assays, and study of responses of HLA-A03 human cells. Lastly, we found that immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice with all the pooled peptides administered with PADRE, GLA-SE, and Pam(2)Cys is an effective way to elicit IFN-\u03B3 producing CD8(\u002B )splenic T cells and protection. Immunizations included the following peptides together: KSFKDILPK (SAG1(224-232)); AMLTAFFLR (GRA6(164-172)); RSFKDLLKK (GRA7(134-142)); STFWPCLLR (SAG2C(13-21)); SSAYVFSVK((SPA250-258)); and AVVSLLRLLK(SPA(89-98)). This immunization elicited robust protection, measured as reduced parasite burden using a luciferase transfected parasite, luciferin, this novel, HLA transgenic mouse model, and imaging with a Xenogen camera. CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasma gondii peptides elicit HLA-A03 restricted, IFN-\u03B3 producing, CD8(\u002B )T cells in humans and mice. These peptides administered with adjuvants reduce parasite burden in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice. This work provides a foundation for immunosense based vaccines.

An immunoassay with the potential for the detection of influenza was developed and tested using hemagglutinin (HA), a commonly studied glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza virions. Gold nanoparticles were synthesized, which present multiple peptide epitopes, including the HA epitope, in order to increase the gravimetric response achieved with the use of a QCM immunosensor for influenza. Specifically, epitopes associated with HA and FLAG peptides were affixed to gold nanoparticles by a six-mer PEG spacer between the epitope and the terminal cysteine. The PEG spacer was shown to enhance the probability for interaction with antibodies by increasing the distance the epitope extends from the gold surface. These nanoparticles were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight, and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies were adhered to the surface of a QCM, and the response of each antibody upon exposure to HA, FLAG, and dual functionalized nanoparticles was compared with binding of Au\u2013tiopronin nanoparticles and H5 HA proteins from influenza virus (H5N1). Results demonstrate that the immunoassay was capable of differentiating between nanoparticles presenting orthogonal epitopes in real-time with minimal nonspecific binding. The detection of H5 HA protein demonstrates the logical extension of using these nanoparticle mimics as a safe positive control in the detection of influenza, making this a vital step in improving influenza detection methodology.

Marama cotyledon ethanolic extract (MCE) and cotyledon water extract (MCW) without RV were not cytotoxic to all cells tested, while seed coat and tuber extracts showed variable levels of cytotoxicity.

All marama extracts used significantly enhanced nitric oxide release from H4 cells and enhanced TER (\u03A9/cm(2)) of enterocyte barriers after coincubation with RV.

Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals \u2014 analogous to \u2018transmissible immunization\u2019 that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multi-scale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV gene-therapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by \u223C30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by \u003C2-fold over 50 years. The TIP\u0027s efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.","publish_time":"2011-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metzger, Vincent T.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Weinberger, Leor S.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40400327bbd828910ba0e013d9de71c012b4d4e1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c44a9d064faca56bd284971828e4db13e656365c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3060167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower HIV","disease control","population-level disease prevalence","Infectious disease treatments","pathogen eradication","AIDS prevalence","viral resistance","robust disease suppression","evolution of pathogen resistance","great majority of disease spread","behavioral disinhibition","recent HIV gene-therapy trial","analyses of HIV field data","superspreader populations","risk disinhibition","viral infectious diseases","fold","years","behavioral barriers","host population","universal challenges","individual patient viral loads","effect of TIPs","risk factors","TIP\u0027s efficacy","TIP concept","difficulty of targeting treatments","optimistic antiretroviral therapy","single-cell level","vaccination campaigns","sub-Saharan Africa","face","poor compliance","new paradigm","potential","transmissible immunization","contrast","individuals","exploitation","Therapeutic Interfering Particles","properties","multi-scale model","live-attenuated vaccines","reversion","virulence","current therapies","proposed intervention","results","presence"],"language":"en"},

The amino acid residue frequency appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level was determined and used to identify \u201Chot spots\u201D or antigenically important regions.

RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. RODS was used during the 2002 Winter Olympics and currently operates in two states\u2014Pennsylvania and Utah. It has been and continues to be a resource for implementing, evaluating, and applying new methods of public health surveillance.","publish_time":"2003-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsui, Fu-Chiang; Espino, Jeremy U.; Dato, Virginia M.; Gesteland, Per H.; Hutman, Judith; Wagner, Michael M.","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b44feca5d6ffaaeb66501fa84cc6dd44d06660a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC212776.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-pdf/10/5/399/2352016/10-5-399.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance","RODS"],"locations":["Pennsylvania","Utah"],"keyphrases":["RODS data","data warehousing techniques","public health surveillance system","Health Level","Disease Surveillance","new methods of public health surveillance","RODS processes sales of over-the-counter health care products","multivariate statistical detection algorithms","early detection of disease outbreaks","syndrome categories","syndrome counts","Web-based user interface","clinical encounters","virtual private networks","leased lines","similar manner","Real-time Outbreak","computer","temporal","visit","implementation","analysis","anomalous patterns","batch mode","design","HL7","registration chief complaint","alerts users","Hospitals","spatial analyses","message protocol","daily basis","relational database","states","Bayesian classifiers","Pennsylvania","Utah","report","Winter Olympics","real time","resource"],"language":"en"},

Overexpression of hnRNP A1 accelerated the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis, whereas the expression in the cytoplasm of a dominant-negative hnRNP A1 mutant that lacks the nuclear transport domain significantly delayed it. The hnRNP A1 mutant caused a global inhibition of viral mRNA transcription and genomic replication, and also a preferential inhibition of the replication of defective-interfering RNAs. Similar to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the hnRNP A1 mutant complexed with an MHV polymerase gene product, the nucleocapsid protein and the viral RNA. However, in contrast to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the mutant protein failed to bind a 250 kDa cellular protein, suggesting that the recruitment of cellular proteins by hnRNP A1 is important for MHV RNA synthesis.

By now the putative pathogen of SARS has been identified as a new coronavirus, a single positive-strand RNA virus. RNA viruses commonly have a high rate of genetic mutation. It is therefore important to know the mutation rate of the SARS coronavirus as it spreads through the population. Moreover, finding a date for the last common ancestor of SARS coronavirus strains would be useful for understanding the circumstances surrounding the emergence of the SARS pandemic and the rate at which SARS coronavirus diverge. METHODS: We propose a mathematical model to estimate the evolution rate of the SARS coronavirus genome and the time of the last common ancestor of the sequenced SARS strains. Under some common assumptions and justifiable simplifications, a few simple equations incorporating the evolution rate (K) and time of the last common ancestor of the strains (T(0)) can be deduced. We then implemented the least square method to estimate K and T(0 )from the dataset of sequences and corresponding times. Monte Carlo stimulation was employed to discuss the results. RESULTS: Based on 6 strains with accurate dates of host death, we estimated the time of the last common ancestor to be about August or September 2002, and the evolution rate to be about 0.16 base/day, that is, the SARS coronavirus would on average change a base every seven days. We validated our method by dividing the strains into two groups, which coincided with the results from comparative genomics. CONCLUSION: The applied method is simple to implement and avoid the difficulty and subjectivity of choosing the root of phylogenetic tree. Based on 6 strains with accurate date of host death, we estimated a time of the last common ancestor, which is coincident with epidemic investigations, and an evolution rate in the same range as that reported for the HIV-1 virus.","publish_time":"2004-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Hongchao; Zhao, Yi; Zhang, Jingfen; Wang, Yuelan; Li, Wei; Zhu, Xiaopeng; Sun, Shiwei; Xu, Jingyi; Ling, Lunjiang; Cai, Lun; Bu, Dongbo; Chen, Runsheng","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3af2ca43010f59c3d1bb731abd011e3dd0fc51c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC516801.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC516801/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common ancestor of SARS coronavirus strains","evolution rate","SARS coronavirus genome","sequenced SARS strains","SARS pandemic","mutation rate","new coronavirus","putative pathogen of SARS","common assumptions","results","high rate of genetic mutation","accurate date of host death","base","applied method","square method","new respiratory infectious epidemic","accurate dates of host death","epidemic investigations","simple equations","RNA viruses","single positive-strand RNA virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","justifiable simplifications","BACKGROUND","mathematical model","average","dataset of sequences","root of phylogenetic tree","subjectivity","corresponding times","difficulty","CONCLUSION","circumstances","emergence","range","Monte Carlo stimulation","METHODS","HIV","days","comparative genomics","groups","population","world"],"language":"en"},

The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations. METHODS: We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues (SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847, SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1, SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated. Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates. RESULTS: Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before 14(th )October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 \u00D7 10(-6 )nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17 mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square = 0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no non-synonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic proteins and consistent deletions in the 3\u0027 \u2013 most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.","publish_time":"2004-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vega, Vinsensius B; Ruan, Yijun; Liu, Jianjun; Lee, Wah Heng; Wei, Chia Lin; Se-Thoe, Su Yun; Tang, Kin Fai; Zhang, Tao; Kolatkar, Prasanna R; Ooi, Eng Eong; Ling, Ai Ee; Stanton, Lawrence W; Long, Philip M; Liu, Edison T","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/def1cf77e1ef84f4373a342e23145be05ec5e226.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC517714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["North China","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV isolates","SARS epidemic","putative SARS-CoV","human transmission","human passage","analysis of human","human populations","paired human","cell culture isolates","SARS coronavirus","SIN2774 isolate","complete SARS-CoV genomes","Singapore isolates","primary human tissues","Non-synonymous mutations","multiple Vero cell passages","consecutive Vero cell passages","cultured isolates","contact isolates","mutation rates","constant mutation rate model","genome sequence","putative ORFs","refined mutation filtering scheme","viral genome","antigenic proteins","antigenic genes","consistent deletions","non-essential ORFs","day","transmission patterns","recent emergence","Taiwan isolate","RESULTS","putative origin","individual tissue samples","individual patient samples","recent estimate","specific selection","North China","Phylogenetic analysis","polymerase genes","certain selection pressures","greater sequence divergence","possible date of emergence","SIN3725V","P1","SIN849","SIN847","SIN845","different quasipecies","SIN846","SIN842","SIN848","SIN3765V","P3","P2","order","SIN850","careful tracing","new pathogen","SIN3408L","functional nature","roots","P4","P5","co-infection","adjusted R-square","etiologic agent","mutational dynamics","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","SIN852","immediate Hotel","site","cases","Close examination","major genetic groups","molecular relationships","nucleotide substitutions","estimates","RNA viruses","exploration","CLpro","ability","palm civet","portion","geographical groupings","BACKGROUND","METHODS","patients","growth","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

It is necessary to define the hybridization properties of these latter probes in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of disease-related genes. Here, we compare and contrast the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of 25mer probes complementary to all possible single nucleotide substitutions and insertions, and one and two base deletions in the 9168 bp coding region of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene. Over 68 different dye-labeled single-stranded nucleic acid targets representing all ATM coding exons were applied to these microarrays. We assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to ATM sequences to those containing mismatches. Probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions, single base deletions and single base insertions. In all the cases, hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra- and intermolecular probe and/or target structure. Furthermore, single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions, two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions. Overall, these studies provide valuable empirical data that can be used to more accurately model the hybridization properties of insertion and deletion probes and improve the design and interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray-based resequencing and mutational analysis.","publish_time":"2005-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karaman, Mazen W.; Groshen, Susan; Lee, Chi-Chiang; Pike, Brian L.; Hacia, Joseph G.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/867e1b0f6ca8757f2a32a625d99b23888ab40d49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC549431.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC549431/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single base deletions","single base substitutions","single base insertions","hybridization properties of probes complementary","single nucleotide insertions","single nucleotide substitution probes","possible single nucleotide substitutions","hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays","deletion probes","hybridization properties of insertion","consistent hybridization specificity data","relative hybridization signals","sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray","small insertions","interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray-based resequencing","highest average specificity","microarray-based screens","ATM coding exons","ATM sequences","mutational analysis of disease","bp coding region","valuable empirical data","intermolecular probe","sequence context","nucleic acid targets","design","mer","ataxia telangiectasia","related genes","genetic variation","order","target structure","studies","different dye","mismatches","cases"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we sought to estimate the influence of pregnant women\u0027s fears of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on their choice of provider, mode of childbirth, and length of stay (LOS) for the delivery during and after the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. METHODS: The National Health Insurance data from January 01, 2002 to December 31, 2003 were used. A population-based descriptive analysis was conducted to assess the changes in volume, market share, cesarean rate, and average LOS for each of the 4 provider levels, before, during and after the SARS epidemic. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-SARS period, medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5.2% and 4.1% in market share for childbirth services during the peak SARS period, while district hospitals and clinics increased 2.1% and 7.1%, respectively. For changes in cesarean rates, only a significantly larger increase was observed in medical centers (2.2%) during the peak SARS period. In terms of LOS, significant reductions in average LOS were observed in all hospital levels except for clinics. Average LOS was shortened by 0.21 days in medical centers (5.6%), 0.21 days in regional hospitals (5.8%), and 0.13 days in district hospitals (3.8%). CONCLUSION: The large amount of patients shifting from the maternity wards of more advanced hospitals to those of less advanced hospitals, coupled with the substantial reduction in their length of maternity stay due to their fears of SARS could also lead to serious concerns for quality of care, especially regarding a patient\u0027s accessibility to quality providers and continuity of care.","publish_time":"2005-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Cheng-Hua; Huang, Nicole; Chang, Hong-Jen; Hsu, Yea-Jen; Wang, Mei-Chu; Chou, Yiing-Jenq","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d619c3ceec4db4f3f350c3d5fb3842bd83f04a80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1084353.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1084353/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","peak SARS period","advanced hospitals","district hospitals","regional hospitals","pre-SARS period","average LOS","public\u0027s overwhelming fears of SARS","quality of care","terms of LOS","medical centers","days","routine care","interrupt patient\u0027s continuity of care","patients","market share","length of maternity","changes","length of stay","provider levels","clinics","influence of pregnant women\u0027s fears of severe acute respiratory syndrome","childbirth services","mode of childbirth","patient\u0027s accessibility","cesarean rates","quality providers","maternity wards","choice of provider","hospital levels","emerging infectious disease","volume","significant reductions","larger increase","substantial reduction","METHODS","National Health Insurance data","serious concerns","delivery","BACKGROUND","descriptive analysis","population","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Taiwan","study"],"language":"en"},

A recent study has suggested that the deletion allele (D allele) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients. Moreover, the ACE D allele has been shown to be more prevalent in patients suffering from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a previous study. Thus, we have investigated the association between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the progression to ARDS or requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. METHOD: One hundred and forty genetically unrelated Chinese SARS patients and 326 healthy volunteers were recruited. The ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: There is no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and the allelic frequencies of the ACE I/D polymorphism between the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects. Moreover, there is also no evidence that ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with the progression to ARDS or the requirement of intensive care in the SARS patients. In multivariate logistic analysis, age is the only factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independent factors associated with the requirement of intensive care. CONCLUSION: The ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and is not associated with poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection.","publish_time":"2005-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, KC Allen; Tang, Nelson LS; Hui, David SC; Chung, Grace TY; Wu, Alan KL; Chim, Stephen SC; Chiu, Rossa WK; Lee, Nelson; Choi, KW; Sung, YM; Chan, Paul KS; Tong, YK; Lai, ST; Yu, WC; Tsang, Owen; Lo, YM Dennis","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6008b68c8b16e3a6a48a2cb892bac5c9353df86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1090578.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1090578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ACE D","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE D allele","D polymorphism","SARS-coronavirus infection","unrelated Chinese SARS patients","D genotypes","ACE insertion","requirement of intensive care","development of ARDS","deletion allele","age","progression","increased susceptibility","healthy volunteers","poor outcomes","disease outcomes","previous study","recent study","healthy control subjects","polymerase chain reaction","adult respiratory distress syndrome","male sex","independent factors","genotypic distributions","agarose gel electrophoresis","angiotensin","allelic frequencies","significant difference","enzyme","hypoxemia","multivariate logistic analysis","association","evidence","genetic predisposition","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHOD","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Nucleotide replacement experiments indicated that m1G37 is critical for leucylation activity. This finding was supported by the fact that the tRNA(Ser)CAGs possessing the leucylation activity always have m1G37, whereas that of Candida cylindracea, which possesses no leucylation activity, has A37. Quantification of defined aminoacetylated tRNAs in cells demonstrated that 3% of the tRNA(Ser)CAGs possessing m1G37 were, in fact, charged with leucine in vivo. A genetic approach using an auxotroph mutant of C.maltosa possessing this type of tRNA(Ser)CAG also suggested that the URA3 gene inactivated due to the translation of CUG as serine was rescued by a slight incorporation of leucine into the polypeptide, which demonstrated that the tRNA charged with multiple amino acids could participate in the translation.

However, within each species, it is unknown whether multiple paralogs have been selected for diversification of function, or for increased dosage of monofunctional PSG. We analysed the evolution of the mouse PSG sequences, and compared them to rat, human and baboon PSGs to attempt to understand the evolution of this complex gene family. RESULTS: Phylogenetic tree analyses indicate that the primate N domains and the rodent N1 domains exhibit a higher degree of conservation than that observed in a comparison of the mouse N1 and N2 domains, or mouse N1 and N3 domains. Compared to human and baboon PSG N domain exons, mouse and rat PSG N domain exons have undergone less sequence homogenisation. The high non-synonymous substitution rates observed in the CFG face of the mouse N1 domain, within a context of overall conservation, suggests divergence of function of mouse PSGs. The rat PSG family appears to have undergone less expansion than the mouse, exhibits lower divergence rates and increased sequence homogenisation in the CFG face of the N1 domain. In contrast to most primate PSG N domains, rodent PSG N1 domains do not contain an RGD tri-peptide motif, but do contain RGD-like sequences, which are not conserved in rodent N2 and N3 domains. CONCLUSION: Relative conservation of primate N domains and rodent N1 domains suggests that, despite independent gene family expansions and structural diversification, mouse and human PSGs retain conserved functions. Human PSG gene family expansion and homogenisation suggests that evolution occurred in a concerted manner that maintains similar functions of PSGs, whilst increasing gene dosage of the family as a whole. In the mouse, gene family expansion, coupled with local diversification of the CFG face, suggests selection both for increased gene dosage and diversification of function. Partial conservation of RGD and RGD-like tri-peptides in primate and rodent N and N1 domains, respectively, supports a role for these motifs in PSG function.","publish_time":"2005-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"McLellan, Andrew S; Zimmermann, Wolfgang; Moore, Tom","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e68ed59a0acf6df0c5ce5a4716b907367fed3f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1185527.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1185527/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSG","PSG N","CFG","RGD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rodent PSG N1 domains","rodent N1 domains","primate PSG N domains","mouse N1 domain","mouse PSG sequences","PSG function","mouse PSGs","rat PSG family","N2 domains","N3 domains","Human PSG gene family expansion","Relative conservation of primate N domains","rat PSG N domain exons","baboon PSG N domain exons","complex gene family","increased gene dosage","increased dosage of monofunctional PSG","rodent N2","gene families","diversification of function","human PSGs","independent gene family expansions","CFG face","divergence of function","Partial conservation of RGD","baboon PSGs","evolution","increased sequence homogenisation","structural diversification","local diversification","similar functions of PSGs","primate pregnancy-specific glycoprotein","context of overall conservation","higher degree of conservation","RGD tri-peptide motif","conserved functions","lower divergence rates","tri-peptides","high non-synonymous substitution rates","Phylogenetic tree analyses","selection","concerted manner","CONCLUSION","role","comparison","contrast","multiple paralogs","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","motifs","species","common ancestor","placental trophoblasts"],"language":"en"},

When the airway mucus layer interacts with high-speed airflow, droplets are expelled as aerosol; their concentration and size distribution may each play an important role in disease transmission. Our goal is to reduce the aerosolizability of respiratory secretions while interfering only minimally with normal mucus clearance using agents capable of increasing crosslinking in the mucin glycoprotein network. METHODS: We exposed mucus simulants (MS) to airflow in a simulated cough machine (SCM). The MS ranged from non-viscous, non-elastic substances (water) to MS of varying degrees of viscosity and elasticity. Mucociliary clearance of the MS was assessed on the frog palate, elasticity in the Filancemeter and the aerosol pattern in a \u0022bulls-eye\u0022 target. The sample loaded was weighed before and after each cough maneuver. We tested two mucomodulators: sodium tetraborate (XL\u0022B\u0022) and calcium chloride (XL \u0022C\u0022). RESULTS: Mucociliary transport was close to normal speed in viscoelastic samples compared to non-elastic, non-viscous or viscous-only samples. Spinnability ranged from 2.5 \u00B1 0.6 to 50.9 \u00B1 6.9 cm, and the amount of MS expelled from the SCM increased from 47 % to 96 % adding 1.5 \u03BCL to 150 \u03BCL of XL \u0022B\u0022. Concurrently, particles were inversely reduced to almost disappear from the aerosolization pattern. CONCLUSION: The aerosolizability of MS was modified by increasing its cohesivity, thereby reducing the number of particles expelled from the SCM while interfering minimally with its clearance on the frog palate.

Certain simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpz, SIVsm) have demonstrated tremendous success in infecting new species, including humans, resulting in the HIV-1 and HIV-2 epidemics. Although SIV diversification has been studied on a population level, the essential substrates for cross-species transmission, namely SIV sequence diversity and the types and extent of viral diversification present in individual reservoir animals have not been elucidated. To characterize this intra-host SIV diversity, we performed sequence analyses of clonal viral envelope (env) V1V2 and gag p27 variants present in individual SIVsm-infected sooty mangabeys over time. RESULTS: SIVsm demonstrated extensive intra-animal V1V2 length variation and amino acid diversity (le38%), and continual variation in V1V2 N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence frequency and location. Positive selection was the predominant evolutionary force. Temporal sequence shifts suggested continual selection, likely due to evolving antibody responses. In contrast, gag p27 was predominantly under purifying selection. SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversification is at least as great as that in HIV-1 infected humans, indicating that extensive viral diversification in and of itself does not inevitably lead to AIDS. CONCLUSION: Positive diversifying selection in this natural reservoir host is the engine that has driven the evolution of the uniquely adaptable SIV/HIV envelope protein. These studies emphasize the importance of retroviral diversification within individual host reservoir animals as a critical substrate in facilitating cross-species transmission.","publish_time":"2006-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demma, LJ; Vanderford, TH; Logsdon, JM; Feinberg, MB; Staprans, SI","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1431560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1431560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversification","SIV diversification","SIV sequence diversity","extensive viral diversification","intra-host SIV diversity","extent of viral diversification present","continual selection","Positive selection","individual host reservoir animals","individual reservoir animals","infecting new species","diversity of pathogen variants present","purifying selection","adaptable SIV","sequence analyses of clonal viral envelope","natural reservoir host","Temporal sequence shifts","Positive diversifying selection","importance of retroviral diversification","HIV envelope protein","gag p27 variants present","facilitating cross-species transmission","individual SIVsm-infected sooty mangabeys","extensive intra-animal V1V2 length variation","V1V2 N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence frequency","continual variation","amino acid diversity","infected humans","new environments","ability of emerging pathogens","critical substrate","existing reservoirs","types","SIVcpz","essential substrates","le38","tremendous success","location","Certain simian immunodeficiency viruses","degree of genomic plasticity","population level","evolving antibody responses","predominant evolutionary force","time","engine","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","studies","CONCLUSION","contrast","epidemics","AIDS"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of effective therapies for Ebola virus infection, the development of a vaccine becomes an important strategy to contain outbreaks. Immunization with DNA and/or replication-defective adenoviral vectors (rAd) encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) has been previously shown to confer specific protective immunity in nonhuman primates. GP can exert cytopathic effects on transfected cells in vitro, and multiple GP forms have been identified in nature, raising the question of which would be optimal for a human vaccine. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this question, we have explored the efficacy of mutant GPs from multiple Ebola virus strains with reduced in vitro cytopathicity and analyzed their protective effects in the primate challenge model, with or without NP. Deletion of the GP transmembrane domain eliminated in vitro cytopathicity but reduced its protective efficacy by at least one order of magnitude. In contrast, a point mutation was identified that abolished this cytopathicity but retained immunogenicity and conferred immune protection in the absence of NP. The minimal effective rAd dose was established at 10(10) particles, two logs lower than that used previously. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of specific GPs alone vectored by rAd are sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge in a relevant nonhuman primate model. Elimination of NP from the vaccine and dose reductions to 10(10) rAd particles do not diminish protection and simplify the vaccine, providing the basis for selection of a human vaccine candidate.","publish_time":"2006-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sullivan, Nancy J; Geisbert, Thomas W; Geisbert, Joan B; Shedlock, Devon J; Xu, Ling; Lamoreaux, Laurie; Custers, Jerome H.

Autotransporters have recently emerged as a good tool for bacterial surface display. These proteins are composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a passenger domain and a translocator domain that mediates the outer membrane translocation of the passenger. The natural passenger domain of autotransporters can be replaced by heterologous proteins that become displayed at the bacterial surface by the translocator domain. The simplicity and versatility of this system has made it very attractive and it has been used to display functional enzymes, vaccine antigens as well as polypeptides libraries. The recent advances in the study of the translocation mechanism of autotransporters have raised several controversial issues with implications for their use as display systems. These issues include the requirement for the displayed polypeptides to remain in a translocation-competent state in the periplasm, the requirement for specific signal sequences and \u0022autochaperone\u0022 domains, and the influence of the genetic background of the expression host strain. It is therefore important to better understand the mechanism of translocation of autotransporters in order to employ them to their full potential.

The protocol was rapidly and effectively instituted by teamwork training using high-fidelity simulation. METHODS: Phase 1 was a curriculum design of a SARS-specific cardiac arrest protocol in three steps: planning the new protocol, repeated simulations of this protocol in a classroom, and a subsequent simulation of a cardiac arrest on a hospital ward. Phase 2 was the training of 275 healthcare workers (HCWs) using the new protocol. Training involved a seminar, practice in wearing the mandatory personal protection system (PPS), and cardiac arrest simulations with subsequent debriefing. RESULTS: Simulation provided insights that had not been considered in earlier phases of development. For example, a single person can don a PPS worn for the SARS patient in 1 1/2 minutes. However, when multiple members of a cardiac arrest team were dressing simultaneously, the time to don the PPS increased to between 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 minutes. Errors in infection control as well as in medical management of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) were corrected. CONCLUSION: During the SARS crisis, real-time use of a high-fidelity simulator allowed the training of 275 HCWs in 2 weeks, with debriefing and error management. HCWs were required to manage the SARS cardiac arrest wearing unfamiliar equipment and following a modified ACLS protocol. The insight gained from this experience will be valuable for future infectious disease challenges in critical care.","publish_time":"2005-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abrahamson, Simon D; Canzian, Sonya; Brunet, Fabrice","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aecd12a815bf5fd6486b92bc8fb631d00fef541f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1550819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1550819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ACLS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS cardiac arrest","SARS-specific cardiac arrest protocol","cardiac arrest simulations","new protocol","cardiac arrest team","SARS crisis","SARS patient","modified ACLS protocol","PPS","HCWs","high-fidelity simulation","subsequent simulation","teamwork training","medical management of advanced cardiac life support","subsequent debriefing","minutes","repeated simulations","high-fidelity simulator","error management","future infectious disease challenges","unfamiliar equipment","steps","mandatory personal protection system","severe acute respiratory syndrome","critical care","practice","real-time use","curriculum design","weeks","experience","multiple members","classroom","infection control","healthcare workers","single person","seminar","hospital ward","earlier phases of development","example","Errors","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","RESULTS","insights","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second RdRp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5\u2032-(G/U)CC-3\u2032 trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of \u003C6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C-terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus RdRps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 RdRp and cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 RdRp produces primers utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp.","publish_time":"2006-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imbert, Isabelle; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Bourhis, Jean-Marie; Bussetta, C\u00E9cile; Coutard, Bruno; Egloff, Marie-Pierre; Ferron, Fran\u00E7ois; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Canard, Bruno","journal":"The EMBO Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d9e41392d9817eeb79b994908433088e3aabff6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1618104.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1618104?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp8 RdRp","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA viruses","RNA coronaviruses","RNA templates","RdRp domain","primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp","cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases","C-terminal domain of nsp8","coronavirus RdRps","catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps","different sets of catalytic residues","non-structural protein","SARS coronavirus","common origin","polarities","activity","subgenome-size RNAs","cognate membrane","Distant structural homology","CC","trinucleotides","replication","transcription","primers","synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides","enzymatic complex","reaction","fidelity","giant"],"language":"en"},

A substantial literature exists on the estimation of k, but most attention has focused on datasets that are not highly overdispersed (i.e., those with k\u22651), and the accuracy of confidence intervals estimated for k is typically not explored. METHODOLOGY: This article presents a simulation study exploring the bias, precision, and confidence interval coverage of maximum-likelihood estimates of k from highly overdispersed distributions. In addition to exploring small-sample bias on negative binomial estimates, the study addresses estimation from datasets influenced by two types of event under-counting, and from disease transmission data subject to selection bias for successful outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that maximum likelihood estimates of k can be biased upward by small sample size or under-reporting of zero-class events, but are not biased downward by any of the factors considered. Confidence intervals estimated from the asymptotic sampling variance tend to exhibit coverage below the nominal level, with overestimates of k comprising the great majority of coverage errors. Estimation from outbreak datasets does not increase the bias of k estimates, but can add significant upward bias to estimates of the mean. Because k varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion, these findings show that overestimation of the degree of overdispersion is very rare for these datasets.","publish_time":"2007-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lloyd-Smith, James O.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/247d3262ad1b15f331a89f70eec56b34dbe6b8b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1791715.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1791715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative binomial estimates","selection bias","small-sample bias","maximum likelihood estimates","significant upward bias","outbreak datasets","negative binomial distribution","confidence interval coverage of maximum","negative binomial dispersion parameter","study addresses estimation","overdispersed count data","attention","degree of overdispersion","accuracy of confidence intervals","overdispersed distributions","small sample size","under-reporting","simulation study","great majority of coverage errors","disease transmission data subject","types of event under-counting","precision","biology","asymptotic sampling variance","substantial literature","successful outbreaks","overestimates","model","findings","overestimation","Results","article","class events","nominal level","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","addition","METHODOLOGY","mean","factors"],"language":"en"},

However, for many researchers not familiar with microarrays, current articles and reviews often address neither the fundamental principles behind the technology nor the proper designing of experiments. Although, microarray technology is relatively simple, conceptually, its practice does require careful planning and detailed understanding of the limitations inherently present. Without these considerations, it can be exceedingly difficult to ascertain valuable information from microarray data. Therefore, this text aims to outline key features in microarray technology, paying particular attention to current applications as outlined in recent publications, experimental design, statistical methods, and potential uses. Furthermore, this review is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather substantive; highlighting important concepts and detailing steps necessary to conduct and interpret microarray experiments.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm reproductive number for HPAI. The reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4, with the maximum farm-based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number, but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time.

Research has to date rather focused on producing predictions for certain localities or under specific conditions, than on designing a publicly available planning tool which can be applied by public health administrations. Here, we provide such a tool which is reproducible by an explicitly formulated structure and designed to operate with an optimal combination of the competing requirements of precision, realism and generality. RESULTS: InfluSim is a deterministic compartment model based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model by clinical and demographic parameters relevant for pandemic preparedness planning. It allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses, hospitalizations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness, all of which may be associated with economic aspects. The software is programmed in Java, operates platform independent and can be executed on regular desktop computers. CONCLUSION: InfluSim is an online available software which efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza. It can reproduce the infection dynamics of pandemic influenza like complex computer simulations while offering at the same time reproducibility, higher computational performance and better operability.","publish_time":"2007-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eichner, Martin; Schwehm, Markus; Duerr, Hans-Peter; Brockmann, Stefan O","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3f471d10a36a7a28e9050c10bd4dfd680cba17b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1832202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1832202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic preparedness planning","infection dynamics of pandemic influenza","public health responses","public health planners","public health administrations","available planning tool","InfluSim","cumulative numbers of influenza cases","online available software","optimal interventions","time reproducibility","time courses","optimal combination","classic SEIR model","deterministic compartment model","demographic parameters relevant","outpatient visits","antiviral treatment doses","hospitalizations","deaths","higher computational performance","competing requirements of precision","complex computer simulations","certain localities","system","predictive models","work days","better operability","differential equations","predictions","realism","impact of different intervention strategies","specific conditions","generality","Java","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","platform independent","regular desktop computers","formulated structure","sickness","economic aspects","Research"],"language":"en"},

The SLC11A1 (or NRAMP1) gene has been studied extensively for genetic association with TB, but with inconsistent findings. In addition, no study has yet looked into the effect of sex and age on the relationship between SLC11A1 polymorphisms and TB. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted. In total, 278 pulmonary TB patients and 282 sex- and age-matched controls without TB were recruited. All subjects were ethnic Chinese. On the basis of linkage disequilibrium pattern, three genetic markers from SLC11A1 and one from the nearby IL8RB locus were selected and examined for association with TB susceptibility. These markers were genotyped using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis or fragment analysis of amplified products. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in allele (P = 0.0165, OR = 1.51) and genotype (P = 0.0163, OR = 1.59) frequencies of the linked markers SLC6a/b (classically called D543N and 3\u0027UTR) of the SLC11A1 locus were found between patients and controls. With stratification by sex, positive associations were identified in the female group for both allele (P = 0.0049, OR = 2.54) and genotype (P = 0.0075, OR = 2.74) frequencies. With stratification by age, positive associations were demonstrated in the young age group (age \u226465 years) for both allele (P = 0.0047, OR = 2.52) and genotype (P = 0.0031, OR = 2.92) frequencies. All positive findings remained significant even after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant differences were noted in either the male group or the older age group. No significant differences were found for the other markers (one SLC11A1 marker and one IL8RB marker) either. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the association between SLC11A1 and TB susceptibility and demonstrated for the first time that the association was restricted to females and the young age group.","publish_time":"2007-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Kim Hung; Yip, Shea Ping; Wong, Wa Sang; Yiu, Lap San; Chan, Kam Keung; Lai, Wai Man; Chow, Eudora YD; Lin, Che Kit; Yam, Wing Cheong; Chan, Kin Sang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0094b25e2500306fadbdfb41d520f2970bb086d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1847518.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1847518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["young age group","TB susceptibility","older age group","SLC11A1 locus","SLC11A1 marker","genetic markers","genetic association","SLC11A1 polymorphisms","significant differences","age-matched controls","pulmonary TB patients","female group","allele","frequencies","genotype","positive associations","positive findings","linked markers SLC6a","effect of sex","IL8RB marker","stratification","Host genetic factors","nearby IL8RB locus","case-control study","inconsistent findings","fragment analysis of amplified products","single strand conformation polymorphism analysis","important determinants","tuberculosis","correction","basis of linkage disequilibrium pattern","relationship","years","BACKGROUND","females","D543N","METHODS","multiple comparisons","UTR","total","RESULTS","subjects","ethnic Chinese","NRAMP1","time","CONCLUSION","addition"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to determine if the period of these infection control measures was associated with changes in overall population mortality due to causes other than SARS. METHODS: Observational study of death registry data, using Poisson regression and interrupted time-series analysis to examine all-cause mortality rates (excluding deaths due to SARS) before, during, and after the SARS outbreak. The population of Ontario was grouped into the Greater Toronto Area (N = 2.9 million) and the rest of Ontario (N = 9.3 million) based upon the level of restrictions on delivery of clinical services during the SARS outbreak. RESULTS: There was no significant change in mortality in the Greater Toronto Area before, during, and after the period of the SARS outbreak in 2003 compared to the corresponding time periods in 2002 and 2001. The rate ratio for all-cause mortality during the SARS outbreak was 0.99 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.93\u20131.06] compared to 2002 and 0.96 [95% CI 0.90\u20131.03] compared to 2001. An interrupted time series analysis found no significant change in mortality rates in the Greater Toronto Area associated with the period of the SARS outbreak. CONCLUSION: Limitations on access to medical services during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto had no observable impact on short-term population mortality. Effects on morbidity and long-term mortality were not assessed. Efforts to contain future infectious disease outbreaks due to influenza or other agents must consider effects on access to essential health care services.","publish_time":"2007-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Stephen W; Cheung, Angela M; Moineddin, Rahim; Bell, Chaim M","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d508ee56bf2773ed13b19b85295c8e8709781bb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1894965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1894965/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Greater Toronto","Toronto"],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","Greater Toronto Area","long-term mortality","short-term population mortality","overall population mortality","all-cause mortality rates","access","medical services","population of Ontario","interrupted time-series analysis","interrupted time series analysis","medical care","significant change","Effects","CI","Extraordinary infection control measures","essential health care services","delivery of clinical services","corresponding time periods","rest of Ontario","Observational study of death registry data","Poisson regression","observable impact","influenza","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","changes","future infectious disease outbreaks","deaths","Efforts","METHODS","agents","BACKGROUND","Limitations","rate ratio","level of restrictions","CONCLUSION","morbidity","Confidence Interval","RESULTS","objective"],"language":"en"},

The usefulness of outbreak detection strategies depends on their specificity; the false alarm rate affects the interpretation of alarms. RESULTS: We evaluate the specificity of five traditional models: autoregressive, Serfling, trimmed seasonal, wavelet-based, and generalized linear. We apply each to 12 years of emergency department visits for respiratory infection syndromes at a pediatric hospital, finding that the specificity of the five models was almost always a non-constant function of the day of the week, month, and year of the study (p \u003C 0.05). We develop an outbreak detection method, called the expectation-variance model, based on generalized additive modeling to achieve a constant specificity by accounting for not only the expected number of visits, but also the variance of the number of visits. The expectation-variance model achieves constant specificity on all three time scales, as well as earlier detection and improved sensitivity compared to traditional methods in most circumstances. CONCLUSION: Modeling the variance of visit patterns enables real-time detection with known, constant specificity at all times. With constant specificity, public health practitioners can better interpret the alarms and better evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surveillance systems.","publish_time":"2007-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wieland, Shannon C; Brownstein, John S; Berger, Bonnie; Mandl, Kenneth D","journal":"BMC Med Inform Decis Mak","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ddd50da1dd398931c5db3d1734948ef27b705bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1919360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1919360/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["constant specificity","real-time detection","earlier detection","outbreak detection method","expectation-variance model","variance of visit patterns","detection of abnormal disease patterns","traditional models","non-constant function","usefulness of outbreak detection strategies","expected number of visits","real time surveillance","generalized additive modeling","models of historical data","time scales","years of emergency department visits","traditional methods","interpretation of alarms","cost-effectiveness of surveillance systems","respiratory infection syndromes","day","Serfling","pediatric hospital","improved sensitivity","false alarm rate","public health practitioners","month","week","accounting","wavelet","study","BACKGROUND","difference","times","circumstances","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

All positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with intracellular membrane rearrangements such as single- or double-membrane vesicles. However, the exact sites of RNA synthesis and crucial topological relationships between relevant membranes, vesicle interiors, surrounding lumens, and cytoplasm generally are poorly defined. We applied electron microscope tomography and complementary approaches to flock house virus (FHV)\u2013infected Drosophila cells to provide the first 3-D analysis of such replication complexes. The sole FHV RNA replication factor, protein A, and FHV-specific 5-bromouridine 5\u0027-triphosphate incorporation localized between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes inside \u223C50-nm vesicles (spherules), which thus are FHV-induced compartments for viral RNA synthesis. All such FHV spherules were outer mitochondrial membrane invaginations with interiors connected to the cytoplasm by a necked channel of \u223C10-nm diameter, which is sufficient for ribonucleotide import and product RNA export. Tomographic, biochemical, and other results imply that FHV spherules contain, on average, three RNA replication intermediates and an interior shell of \u223C100 membrane-spanning, self-interacting protein As. The results identify spherules as the site of protein A and nascent RNA accumulation and define spherule topology, dimensions, and stoichiometry to reveal the nature and many details of the organization and function of the FHV RNA replication complex. The resulting insights appear relevant to many other positive-strand RNA viruses and support recently proposed structural and likely evolutionary parallels with retrovirus and double-stranded RNA virus virions.","publish_time":"2007-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kopek, Benjamin G; Perkins, Guy; Miller, David J; Ellisman, Mark H; Ahlquist, Paul","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77a8c567572cf005f58dc577dc44f711aabe3fd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1945040.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1945040/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","FHV RNA","FHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FHV RNA replication complex","FHV spherules","RNA replication intermediates","Positive-strand RNA viruses","sole FHV RNA replication factor","viral RNA synthesis","nascent RNA accumulation","product RNA export","FHV-specific","exact sites of RNA synthesis","double-stranded RNA virus virions","FHV-induced compartments","double-membrane vesicles","membrane-spanning","replication complexes","outer mitochondrial membrane invaginations","relevant membranes","outer mitochondrial membranes","site of protein","intracellular membrane rearrangements","results","cytoplasm","nm vesicles","largest genetic class of viruses","self-interacting protein","vesicle interiors","nm diameter","flock house virus","retrovirus","crucial topological relationships","complementary approaches","support","genomes","likely evolutionary parallels","spherule topology","association","function","ribonucleotide import","surrounding lumens","interior shell","electron microscope tomography","organization","average","triphosphate incorporation","stoichiometry","dimensions","bromouridine","infected Drosophila cells","necked channel","serious human pathogens","nature","details","D analysis","resulting insights"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R(0) = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30\u201340 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results illustrate the importance of considering the population dynamics when making statements about the epidemiological parameters of Influenza.

Establishing the best fusion partner for difficult-to-express proteins remains empirical. To determine which fusion tags are best suited for difficult-to-express proteins, a comparative analysis of the newly described SUMO fusion system with a variety of commonly used fusion systems was completed. For this study, three model proteins, enhanced green florescent protein (eGFP), matrix metalloprotease-13 (MMP13), and myostatin (growth differentiating factor-8, GDF8), were fused to the C termini of maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin (TRX), NUS A, ubiquitin (Ub), and SUMO tags. These constructswere expressed in E. coli and evaluated for expression and solubility. As expected, the fusion tags varied in their ability to produce tractable quantities of soluble eGFP, MMP13, and GDF8. SUMO and NUS A fusions enhanced expression and solubility of recombinant proteins most dramatically. The ease at which SUMO and NUS A fusion tags were removed from their partner proteins was then determined. SUMO fusions are cleaved by the natural SUMO protease, while an AcTEV protease site had to be engineered between NUS A and its partner protein. A kinetic analysis showed that the SUMO and AcTEV proteases had similarK(M) values, but SUMOprotease had a 25-fold higher k(cat) than AcTEV protease, indicating a more catalytically efficient enzyme. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SUMO is superior to commonly used fusion tags in enhancing expression and solubility with the distinction of generating recombinant protein with native sequences.","publish_time":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marblestone, Jeffrey G.; Edavettal, Suzanne C.; Lim, Yiting; Lim, Peter; Zuo, Xun; Butt, Tauseef R.","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6ce1897300b3ec7ee6be552d0b1a8d3da743b54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2242369.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2242369?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUMO","NUS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion tags","SUMO tags","SUMO fusions","described SUMO fusion system","best fusion partner","recombinant protein expression","natural SUMO protease","NUS","partner proteins","solubility of recombinant proteins","express proteins","binding protein","model proteins","availability of numerous gene fusion systems","green florescent protein","AcTEV protease site","MMP13","AcTEV proteases","GDF8","comparative analysis","Escherichia coli","kinetic analysis","tractable quantities of soluble eGFP","MBP","variety","glutathione S-transferase","GST","distinction","matrix metalloprotease","C termini of maltose","growth","thioredoxin","TRX","similarK","ubiquitin","native sequences","values","factor","myostatin","cat","SUMOprotease","study","results","efficient enzyme","constructswere"],"language":"en"},

Location Northern Bohemia (Czech Republic, central Europe) in the Je\u0161t\u011Bdsk\u00FD h\u0159bet mountain range and its neighbourhood. Methods Three data sets were sampled: a floristic data set at the broad scale, another floristic data set at the intermediate scale, and a vegetation data set at the habitat scale. First, in each data set, species groups were produced by the COCKTAIL algorithm, which ensures maximized joint occurrence in the data set using a fidelity coefficient. Corresponding species groups were produced in the individual data sets by employing the same species for starting the algorithm. Second, the species groups formed in one data set, i.e. at a particular scale, were applied crosswise to the other data sets, i.e. to the other scales. Correspondence of a species group formed at a particular scale with a species group at another scale was determined. Third, to highlight the driving factors for the distribution of the plant species groups at each scale, canonical correspondence analysis was carried out. Results Twelve species groups were used to analyse the transferability of the groups across the three scales, but only six of them were found to be common to all scales. Correspondence of species groups derived from the finest scale with those derived at the broadest scale was, on average, higher than in the opposite direction. Forest (tree layer) cover, altitude and bedrock type explained most of the variability in canonical correspondence analysis across all scales. Main conclusions Transferability of species groups distinguished at a fine scale to broader scales is better than it is in the opposite direction. Therefore, a possible application of the results is to use species groups to predict the potential occurrence of missing species in broad\u2010scale floristic surveys from fine\u2010scale vegetation\u2010plot data.","publish_time":"2006-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pet\u0159\u00EDk, Petr; Bruelheide, Helge","journal":"J Biogeogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c450b6a5839eb31e8ea23ea7ffa759e72a7fd666.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159123/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Location Northern Bohemia"],"locations":["Czech Republic","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Correspondence of species groups","broad scale","fine scale","plant species groups","Corresponding species groups","scale vegetation","particular scale","intermediate scale","habitat scale","broadest scale","finest scale","assemblages of species","scale floristic surveys","floristic data set","vegetation data set","Main conclusions Transferability of species groups","plot data","potential occurrence of missing species","individual data sets","broader scales","various scales","canonical correspondence analysis","Results","opposite direction","COCKTAIL algorithm","driving factors","driving forces","maximized joint occurrence","central Europe","cover","Czech Republic","Je\u0161t\u011Bdsk\u00FD h\u0159bet mountain range","altitude","Location Northern Bohemia","variability","distribution","tree layer","bedrock type","neighbourhood","average","Forest","fidelity coefficient","possible application","nature","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Design: A retrospective cohort study. Setting: Three hundred eighty\u2010one Tennessee nursing homes. Participants: Nursing home residents. Measurements: Viral surveillance data were used to define three seasons: influenza (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cocirculating), RSV (RSV alone circulating), and non winter\u2010viral (neither virus circulating). Adjusted seasonal differences in rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, antibiotic prescriptions, and deaths during these three seasons were calculated to estimate annual hospitalizations, courses of antibiotics, and deaths attributable to influenza and RSV from 1995 to 1999. Results: Nursing home residents had 81,885 person\u2010years of follow\u2010up. In the 63% of residents with comorbid conditions that increase influenza morbidity, influenza infection contributed to an estimated average of 28 hospitalizations, 147 courses of antibiotics, and 15 deaths per 1,000 persons annually. Similarly, RSV accounted for an annual average of 15 hospitalizations, 76 courses of antibiotics, and 17 deaths per 1,000 persons. Influenza and RSV accounted for 7% of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations and 9% of total deaths in high\u2010risk residents during the 4 study years. Absolute morbidity and mortality were lower in residents without identified comorbid conditions but accounted for 15% of hospitalizations and 14% of deaths. These estimates depend on the assumption that morbidity and mortality from other respiratory viruses were distributed evenly between the three defined seasons. Conclusion: Influenza and RSV substantially increased hospitalization rates, antibiotic use, and deaths in elderly nursing home residents each winter. These data should encourage persistent efforts toward disease prevention, and thoughtful study of vaccine development and delivery, diagnostic tools, and methods of prophylaxis and therapy.","publish_time":"2003-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ellis, Shelley E.; Coffey, Christopher S.; Mitchel, Edward F.; Dittus, Robert S.; Griffin, Marie R.","journal":"J Am Geriatr Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/454ba0142969abbd74cecea25b338bfe8cdc700b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Tennessee"],"keyphrases":["RSV","influenza morbidity","Tennessee nursing home residents","elderly nursing home residents","high\u2010risk residents","influenza infection","total deaths","deaths attributable","annual hospitalizations","rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations","mortality","courses of antibiotics","study years","winter viral","Tennessee nursing homes","related morbidity","Absolute morbidity","consecutive years","annual average","comorbid conditions","Viral surveillance data","years of follow\u2010up","defined seasons","persons","respiratory syncytial virus","retrospective cohort study","antibiotic use","hospitalization rates","thoughtful study of vaccine development","antibiotic prescriptions","respiratory viruses","estimated average","delivery","diagnostic tools","disease prevention","cocirculating","methods of prophylaxis","persistent efforts","seasonal differences","Design","Measurements","assumption","Participants","Results","therapy","estimates","Objectives","Setting","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The major product of these immunocytes is polymeric (p)IgA (mainly dimers) with associated J chain. Both pIgA and pentameric IgM contain a binding site for the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), or secretory component (SC), which is a requirement for their active external transport through secretory epithelia. The pIgR/SC binding site depends on covalent incorporation of the J chain into the quaternary structure of the polymers when they are produced by the local immunocytes. This important differentiation characteristic appears to be sufficient functional justification for the J chain to be expressed also by most B cells terminating at secretory effector sites with IgD or IgG production; they probably represent a \u2018spin\u2010off\u2019 from sequential downstream C(H) switching on its way to pIgA expression, thus apparently reflecting a maturational stage of effector B\u2010cell clones compatible with homing to these sites. Observations in IgA\u2010deficient individuals suggest that the magnitude of this homing is fairly well maintained even when the differentiation pathway to IgA is blocked. Certain microenvironmental elements such as specific cytokines and dendritic cells appear to be required for induction of IgA synthesis, but it remains virtually unknown why this isotype normally is such a dominating product of local immunocytes and why they have such a high level of J chain expression. Also, despite the recent identification of some important requirements in terms of adhesion molecules (e.g. integrin \u03B14\u03B27 and MAdCAM\u20101) that explain the \u201Cgut\u2010seeking\u201D properties of enterically induced B cells, the origin of regionalized homing of B cells to secretory effector sites outside the gut remains elusive. Moreover, little is known about immune regulation underlying the striking disparity of both the class (IgD, IgM) and subclass (IgA1, IgA2, IgGI, IgG2) production patterns shown by local iinmttnocytes in various regions of the body, although the topical microbiota and other environmental stimuli might be important. Rational design of local vaccines will depend on better knowledge of both inductive and migratory properties of human mucosal B cells.","publish_time":"2006-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brandtzaeg, Per; Farstad, Inger Nina; Johansen, Finn\u2010Eirik; Morton, H.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor that also induces potent increases in vascular permeability; it is a candidate mediator of rhinorrhea in response to rhinovirus infection as well as contributing to enhanced vascular leakage in rhinovirus\u2010linked asthma exacerbations. It has been shown that rhinovirus induces significant increases in both VEGF protein and mRNA in primary airway fibroblasts [Ghildyal et al. (2005): J Med Virol 75:608\u2013615]. The current studies assessed VEGF responses to rhinovirus in primary culture airway epithelium, in epithelial and fibroblast cell lines and in rhinovirus\u2010infected nasal secretions. Epithelial and fibroblast cells were infected with rhinovirus serotype 16 and VEGF protein and isoforms assessed by ELISA and RT\u2010PCR, respectively. VEGF protein was released by both epithelial and fibroblast cell lines and primary airway epithelial cells in culture but was not increased following rhinovirus infection. PCR products coding for four or five of the six known VEGF isoforms were produced (121, 145, 165 and 183, and/or 189 amino acids) in cell lines and primary culture cells, but no specific isoform was linked to rhinovirus infection. Nasal VEGF was also measured in a cohort of asthmatics with verified rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. VEGF was not raised following rhinovirus infection alone, but was increased significantly if concomitant RSV infection was present. The data suggest that fibroblasts rather than the epithelium may play a key role in VEGF mediated vascular responses after rhinovirus infection. This may aid recruitment of inflammatory cells and contribute to airway inflammation and bronchial obstruction. J. Med.

Double immunoperoxidase staining for herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens and glial fibrillary acidic protein showed that most of the infected cells were astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was completely lost in the inferior medial portion of the trigeminal root entry zone at 6 days after herpes simplex virus type 1 inoculation, a time when central nervous system myelin was preserved as indicated by immunostaining for myelin basic protein. The pattern of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining did not change and herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens were no longer detected after day 8. There was a progressive loss of myelin basic protein staining within the area unstained by glial fibrillary acidic protein antisera on days 8 to 14. This pattern of astrocyte loss before central nervous system demyelination is strikingly different from the reactive astrocytosis seen in other demyelinating lesions, such as acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or acute multiple sclerosis.

Sustaining control of VL in terms of proper and prevailing immunity development is a global necessity amid unavailability of a prophylactic vaccine. Screening of experimental proteome of the human disease propagating form of Leishmania donovani (amastigote) can be more pragmatic for in silico mining of novel vaccine candidates. METHODS: By using an immunoinformatic approach, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell-specific epitopes from experimentally reported L. donovani proteins having secretory potential and increased abundance in amastigotes were screened. A chimera linked with a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) peptide adjuvant was constructed and evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, binding interaction with TLR4 in simulated physiological condition and the trend of immune response following hypothetical immunization. RESULTS: Selected epitopes from physiologically important L. donovani proteins were found mostly conserved in L. infantum, covering theoretically more than 98% of the global population. The multi-epitope chimeric vaccine was predicted as stable, antigenic and non-allergenic. Structural analysis of vaccine-TLR4 receptor docked complex and its molecular dynamics simulation suggest sufficiently stable binding interface along with prospect of non-canonical receptor activation.

The hallmark of its pathology is the demyelinated plaque with reactive glial scar formation. However, a detailed analysis of the patterns of demyelination, oligodendroglia cell pathology and the reaction of other tissue components suggests that the pathogenesis of myelin destruction in this disease may be heterogeneous. In this review we present a new classification scheme of lesional activity on the basis of the molecular composition of myelin degradation products in macrophages. When these criteria are used, different patterns of demyelination can be distinguished, including demyelination with relative preservation of oligodendrocytes, myelin destruction with concomitant and complete destruction of oligodendrocytes or primary destruction or disturbance of myelinating cells with secondary demyelination. Furthermore, in some cases a primary selective demyelination may be followed by secondary oligodendrocyte loss in the established lesions. Finally, some extraordinarily severe conditions may result in destructive lesions with loss of myelin, oligodendrocytes, axons and astro\u2010cytes. This heterogeneity of plaque pathology is discussed in the context of recent experimental models of inflammatory demyelination, which show that different immunological pathways may lead to the formation of demyelinated plaques that reveal the diverse structural aspects described above. Our data indicate, that the demyelinated plaques of multiple sclerosis may reflect a common pathological end point of a variety of different immunological mechanisms of myelin destruction in this disease.","publish_time":"2008-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucchinetti, Claudia F.; Br\u00FCck, Wolfgang; Rodriguez, Moses; Lassmann, Hans","journal":"Brain Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91f04cbb97f04d84ac0c82015619a5dbdf3c0407.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["secondary demyelination","pathogenesis of myelin destruction","different patterns of demyelination","primary destruction","loss of myelin","complete destruction of oligodendrocytes","primary selective demyelination","variety of different immunological mechanisms of myelin destruction","formation of demyelinated plaques","demyelinated plaques of multiple sclerosis","context of recent experimental models of inflammatory demyelination","nating disease","different immunological pathways","heterogeneity of plaque pathology","molecular composition of myelin degradation products","relative preservation of oligodendrocytes","secondary oligodendrocyte loss","oligodendroglia cell pathology","destructive lesions","established lesions","reactive glial scar formation","disturbance of myelinating cells","basis","common pathological end point","new classification scheme of lesional activity","reaction","axons","central nervous system","tissue components","macrophages","astro","diverse structural aspects","review","severe conditions","detailed analysis","cases","data","criteria","hallmark"],"language":"en"},

The concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (e.g. superoxide, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite) can increase dramatically under conditions such as inflammation, and this can overwhelm the inherent antioxidant defences within lesions. Such oxidative and/or nitrative stress can damage the lipids, proteins and nucleic acids of cells and mitochondria, potentially causing cell death. Oligodendrocytes are more sensitive to oxidative and nitrative stress in vitro than are astrocytes and microglia, seemingly due to a diminished capacity for antioxidant defence, and the presence of raised risk factors, including a high iron content. Oxidative and nitrative stress might therefore result in vivo in selective oligodendrocyte death, and thereby demyelination. The reactive species may also damage the myelin sheath, promoting its attack by macrophages. Damage can occur directly by lipid peroxidation, and indirectly by the activation of proteases and phospholipase A(2). Evidence for the existence of oxidative and nitrative stress within inflammatory demyelinating lesions includes the presence of both lipid and protein peroxides, and nitrotyrosine (a marker for peroxynitrite formation).

RNA interference, a conserved mechanism in which a sequence\u2010specific gene\u2010silencing process is mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), is a promising method of gene therapy in treating a variety of viral diseases. Aim. To investigate the antiviral effects of siRNA on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV\u20101) replication in Vero cells. Methods. The antiviral effects of siRNA duplexes targeting the VP16 and DNA polymerase genes of HSV\u20101 were evaluated by yield\u2010reduction and plaque\u2010reduction assays. The effect of siRNA on the expression of target genes was measured by real\u2010time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results. Two siRNA duplexes (siRNA\u20101, targeting VP16, and siRNA\u20104, targeting DNA polymerase), were found to be highly effective in inhibiting HSV\u20101 replication. siRNA\u20101 and siRNA\u20104 reduced HSV\u20101 replication by around 2 log(10) and 1 log(10) in the yield\u2010\u2010reduction assay and by \u223C85% and \u223C70% in the plaque\u2010reduction assay, respectively.

Data were analyzed according to the known breeding sites and the level of ethanol tolerance of these species. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was assayed with both ethanol (E) and isopropanol (I). Our results show a very broad range of activities among the 71 species investigated, the ratio of the highest value observed (D. melanogaster) to the lowest (D. pruinosa) being 65:1. A general positive correlation was found between the level of ADH activity and the capacity to detoxify ethanol. Nevertheless, many species show exceptions to this rule. Contrary to a logical expectation, adaptation to high alcoholic resources, which has been a recurrent evolutionary event, was not mediated by a more efficient use of ethanol, that is, an increase of the E/I ratio. This ratio seems to be quite variable according to the phylogeny and is especially low in the subgenus Sophophora as well as in Zaprionus. Alcohol tolerance clearly is related to the larval habitat of the species and shows that adaptation to alcoholic resources has been a major evolutionary challenge in drosophilids. This adaptation is not related to phylogeny, having occurred independently several times during the evolution of the group. Finally, it should be borne in mind that, besides metabolization and detoxification, other physiological processes such as nervous\u2010system tolerance or ethanol excretion may be involved in ethanol tolerance, and such functions also should be investigated. Environmental ethanol, which is certainly a major ecological parameter for many drosophilids, has selected a diversity of physiological adaptations, all related to the Adh locus, but presumably much more complicated than was previously believed.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mer\u00E7ot, Herve; Defaye, Danielle; Capy, Pierre; Pla, Eliane; David, Jean R.","journal":"Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d65aa0c8c6ce636741749d51bf38602d88b4c059.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["level of ethanol tolerance","ethanol excretion","Environmental ethanol","Alcohol tolerance","efficient use of ethanol","adults of species","ratio","level of ADH activity","Alcohol dehydrogenase activity","system tolerance","related genus Zaprionus","drosophilids","Adh locus","phylogeny","high alcoholic resources","major evolutionary challenge","physiological processes","diversity of physiological adaptations","major ecological parameter","recurrent evolutionary event","logical expectation","Drosophila","known breeding sites","metabolization","detoxification","capacity","broad range of activities","melanogaster","times","subgenus Sophophora","highest value","increase","general positive correlation","larval habitat","group","results","mind","exceptions","rule","isopropanol","functions","pruinosa","Data"],"language":"en"},

Here, we focus on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and a protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) to investigate how host migration affects infectious disease processes. Previous work showed that parasite prevalence was lower among migratory than nonmigratory monarch populations; two explanations for this pattern are that (1) migration allows animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats (i.e., migratory escape), and (2) long\u2010distance migration weeds out infected animals (i.e., migratory culling). We combined field\u2010sampling and analysis of citizen science data to examine spatiotemporal trends of parasite prevalence and evaluate evidence for these two mechanisms. Analysis of within\u2010breeding\u2010season variation in eastern North America showed that parasite prevalence increased from early to late in the breeding season, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory escape. Prevalence was also positively related to monarch breeding activity, as indexed by larval density. Among adult monarchs captured at different points along the east coast fall migratory flyway, parasite prevalence declined as monarchs progressed southward, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory culling. Parasite prevalence was also lower among monarchs sampled at two overwintering sites in Mexico than among monarchs sampled during the summer breeding period. Collectively, these results indicate that seasonal migration can affect parasite transmission in wild animal populations, with implications for predicting disease risks for species with threatened migrations.","publish_time":"2011-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartel, Rebecca A.; Oberhauser, Karen S.; de Roode, Jacobus C.; Altizer, Sonia M.","journal":"Ecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a5edefb3d675bdd4c83ea3b32d0143726f628fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["eastern North America","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["parasite transmission","protozoan parasite","spatiotemporal trends of parasite prevalence","hypothesis of migratory escape","migratory flyway","Seasonal migration","hypothesis of migratory culling","host migration","breeding season","long\u2010distance migration","monarch breeding activity","adult monarchs","nonmigratory monarch populations","infected animals","monarch butterflies","summer breeding period","wild animal populations","disease risks","season variation","animal systems","infectious disease processes","analysis of citizen science data","eastern North America","east coast","implications","different points","species","sampling","Danaus plexippus","Ophryocystis elektroscirrha","contaminated habitats","threatened migrations","interactions","explanations","overwintering sites","evidence","Previous work","field","Mexico","pattern","larval density","parasites","results","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

In this study the role of ACE2 active\u2010site residues was explored by site\u2010directed mutagenesis. Arg273 was found to be critical for substrate binding such that its replacement causes enzyme activity to be abolished.

The difference in chloride sensitivity between ACE2 and ACE was investigated, and the absence of a second chloride\u2010binding site (CL2) in ACE2 confirmed.

Polylactic acid (PLA) for 3D printing is widely available and biocompatible, but there is a gap in knowledge concerning its compatibility with chemical disinfectants. In this study, 3D-printed PLA tensile samples were created with six different printer settings. Each of these six batches consisted of five sets with five or six samples. The first set remained untreated, the others were soaked in Cidex OPA or in a chlorine solution. These were applied for seven consecutive days or in 25 short cycles. All samples were weighed before and after treatment and subjected to a tensile test. Results showed that a third of the treatments led to an increase of the median weight with a maximum of 8.3%, however, the samples with the best surface quality did not change. The median strength increase was 12.5% and the largest decrease was 8.8%. The median stiffness decreased 3.6% in one set and increased in three others up to 13.6%. When 3D printing PLA medical tools, surface porosity must be minimized to prevent transfer of disinfectants to people. The wide variability of mechanical properties due to 3D printing itself and as a consequence of disinfection must be considered when designing medical tools by selecting appropriate printer settings.

Although \u03B22 adrenergic receptor agonists are commonly used to relax airway smooth muscle for treating AHR, there are side effects such as desensitization of long-term use. Therefore, it is desirable to develop alternative relaxant for airway smooth muscle, preferably based on natural products. One potential candidate is the inexpensive and widely available natural herb saponins of Dioscorea nipponicae (SDN), which has recently been reported to suppress the level of inflammatory factor IL-17A in ovalbumin-induced mice, thereby alleviating the inflammation symptoms of asthma. Here, we evaluated the biomechanical effect of SDN on IL-17A-mediated changes of cultured human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in vitro. The stiffness and traction force of the cells were measured by optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC), and Fourier transform traction microscopy (FTTM), respectively. The cell proliferation was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetry, the cell migration was measured by cell scratch test, and the changes of cell cytoskeleton were assessed by laser confocal microscopy. We found that the stiffness and traction force of HASMCs were enhanced along with the increases of IL-17A concentration and exposure time, and SDN treatment dose-dependently reduced these IL-17A-induced changes in cell mechanical properties. Furthermore, SDN alleviated IL-17A-mediated effects on HASMCs proliferation, migration, and cytoskeleton remodeling. These results demonstrate that SDN could potentially be a novel drug candidate as bronchodilator for treating asthma-associated AHR.","publish_time":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yue; Zhang, Yifan; Zhang, Ming; Li, Jingjing; Pan, Yan; Liu, Lei; Deng, Linhong","journal":"J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/707b64571871de1d0da10ec41d152639d7b93361.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164499.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SDN alleviated IL","cell migration","cell proliferation","changes of cell cytoskeleton","Airway hyperresponsiveness","increases of IL","mediated changes of cultured human airway smooth muscle cells","contractile response of asthmatic airway smooth muscle","traction force of HASMCs","induced changes","HASMCs proliferation","traction microscopy","cell scratch test","cell mechanical properties","SDN treatment dose","asthma-associated AHR","biomechanical effect of SDN","mediated effects","level of inflammatory factor IL","stiffness","inflammation symptoms of asthma","cytoskeleton remodeling","natural products","potential candidate","main pathologic features of bronchial asthma","novel drug candidate","ovalbumin-induced mice","laser confocal microscopy","available natural herb saponins of Dioscorea nipponicae","OMTC","bronchodilator","exposure time","optical magnetic twisting cytometry","Fourier","MTT","colorimetry","concentration","alternative relaxant","diphenyltetrazolium bromide","\u03B22 adrenergic receptor agonists","desensitization of long-term use","FTTM","dimethylthiazol","results"],"language":"en"},

Objective Twenty\u2010seven non\u2010smoking atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects participated in a placebo\u2010controlled, parallel study. A dose of 0.5\u20132.9 \u00B1 10(4) TCID50 RV16 or placebo was nasally administered. Cold symptoms were recorded by questionnaire throughout the study. Histamine challenges were performed at entry, and on days 4 and 11 after inoculation. Nasal lavages were obtained at entry, and on days 2 and 9. The response to histamine was measured by PC(20) (changes expressed as doubling doses: DD). IL\u20108 levels were obtained by ELISA, and were expressed in ng/ml. Results RV infection was confirmed by culture of nasal lavage and/or by antibody titre rise in each of the RV16\u2010treated subjects. Among the 19 RV16\u2010treated subjects, eight developed severe cold symptoms. Baseline FEV(1) did not change significantly during the study in either treatment group (P= 0.99).

To elucidate the possible role of NEC in antigen presentation, we examined the expression of HLA\u2010DR, CD80 and CD86 in NEC, their regulation by cytokines and the capacity of NEC to induce antigen\u2010specific proliferation of T cells. Methods We examined the expression of HLA\u2010DR, CD80 and CD86 in nasal epithelial scrapings of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to Japanese cedar pollen pre\u2010season and in\u2010season, by immunohistochemistry.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of these infections in acute and chronic diarrhoea. Methods Stool specimens from 377 HIV\u2010infected patients presenting with diarrhoea were studied prospectively for evidence of non\u2010CMV enteric viral infection. Patients with diarrhoea underwent investigation for gastrointestinal pathogens, including electron microscopic examination of stool for enteric viruses. We collected data on patients in whom enteric virus was identified and examined the association of enteric virus infection with diarrhoeal symptomatology. Results Eighty\u2010nine (10.3%) stool specimens from 60 (15.9%) HIV(\u002B) individuals were positive for coronavirus (n = 13, 22%), rotavirus (n = 11, 18%), adenovirus (n = 30, 50%) and small round structured viruses (n = 5, 8%) or dual infection (n = 2, 3%). Thirty\u2010four of 52 (65%) patients available for analysis had acute diarrhoea, and 18/52 (35%) had chronic diarrhoea. Twenty\u2010three of 52 (44%) patients had a concurrent gut pathogen. After exclusion of concurrent pathogens enteric viral infections were found to be significantly associated with acute as opposed to chronic diarrhoea (P = 0.004). The presence of adenovirus colitis was significantly more likely to be associated with chronic diarrhoea (15/21 cases) than adenovirus isolated from stool alone (9/23 cases) (P = 0.03). There was a trend towards an association between adenovirus colitis and colonic cytomegalovirus infection (P = 0.06). Conclusion Enteric viral infection is strongly associated with acute diarrhoea in patients with HIV. Light microscopic examination of large bowel biopsies can identify adenovirus colitis which is significantly associated with chronic diarrhoea, and in addition may facilitate gastrointestinal co\u2010infection with CMV.","publish_time":"2001-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, PD.; Pollok, RcG.; Gazzard, BG.","journal":"HIV Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cd2b04d64fd88fa96a05d3d0fe20f6cb5d13cd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165535.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic diarrhoea","acute diarrhoea","association of enteric virus infection","Conclusion Enteric viral infection","enteric viruses","evidence of non\u2010CMV enteric viral infection","dual infection","infected patients","patients available","HIV","colonic cytomegalovirus infection","gastrointestinal co\u2010infection","exclusion of concurrent pathogens enteric viral infections","presence of adenovirus colitis","Methods Stool specimens","electron microscopic examination of stool","gastrointestinal pathogens","cases","role of non\u2010cytomegalovirus","human immunodeficiency virus","Light microscopic examination of large bowel biopsies","concurrent gut pathogen","small round structured viruses","investigation","addition","diarrhoeal symptomatology","individuals","analysis","coronavirus","trend","data","Background","prevalence","rotavirus","Results"],"language":"en"},

Anticipated advantages of this approach include a heightened barrier against the development of viral resistance and a broadened pathogen target spectrum. Myxoviruses are predominantly associated with acute disease and thus are particularly attractive for this approach since treatment time can be kept limited. To identify inhibitor candidates, we have analyzed hit compounds that emerged from a large-scale high-throughput screen for their ability to block replication of members of both the orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus families. This has returned a compound class with broad anti-viral activity including potent inhibition of different influenza virus and paramyxovirus strains. After hit-to-lead chemistry, inhibitory concentrations are in the nanomolar range in the context of immortalized cell lines and human PBMCs. The compound shows high metabolic stability when exposed to human S-9 hepatocyte subcellular fractions. Antiviral activity is host-cell species specific and most pronounced in cells of higher mammalian origin, supporting a host-cell target. While the compound induces a temporary cell cycle arrest, host mRNA and protein biosynthesis are largely unaffected and treated cells maintain full metabolic activity. Viral replication is blocked at a post-entry step and resembles the inhibition profile of a known inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) activity. Direct assessment of RdRp activity in the presence of the reagent reveals strong inhibition both in the context of viral infection and in reporter-based minireplicon assays. In toto, we have identified a compound class with broad viral target range that blocks host factors required for viral RdRp activity. Viral adaptation attempts did not induce resistance after prolonged exposure, in contrast to rapid adaptation to a pathogen-directed inhibitor of RdRp activity.","publish_time":"2011-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krumm, Stefanie A.; Ndungu, J.

Here, we investigated the functional mechanisms of PD-1 as related to FH pathogenesis induced by the murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3). High levels of PD-1-positive CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B) T cells, NK cells and macrophages were observed in liver, spleen, lymph node and thymus tissues following MHV-3 infection. PD-1-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher expression of the effector molecule which initiates fibrinogen deposition, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), than did their wild-type (WT) littermates. As a result, more severe tissue damage was produced and mortality rates were higher. Fluorescence double-staining revealed that FGL2 and PD-1 were not co-expressed on the same cells, while quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that higher levels of IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 mRNA transcription occurred in PD-1-deficient mice in response to MHV-3 infection. Conversely, in vivo blockade of IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 led to efficient inhibition of FGL2 expression, greatly attenuated the development of tissue lesions, and ultimately reduced mortality. Thus, the up-regulation of FGL2 in PD-1-deficient mice was determined to be mediated by IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1. Taken together, our results suggest that PD-1 signaling plays an essential role in decreasing the immunopathological damage induced by MHV-3 and that manipulation of this signal might be a useful strategy for FH immunotherapy.","publish_time":"2011-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yongwen; Wu, Shengxi; Guo, Guoning; Fei, Lei; Guo, Sheng; Yang, Chengying; Fu, Xiaolan; Wu, Yuzhang","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06c0371d82953f5c35ee8bff3e5165d5aa1516de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3131267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3131267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzMw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","FH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV","High levels of PD","functional mechanisms of PD","IFN-\u03B3","deficient mice","higher levels of IFN","higher expression","regulation of FGL2","TNF-\u03B1 mRNA transcription","limit immunopathological damage","T cells","severe tissue damage","NK cells","efficient inhibition of FGL2 expression","blockade of IFN","FH pathogenesis","FH immunotherapy","infection","fibrinogen deposition","precise role","essential role","mortality rates","reduced mortality","fulminant viral hepatitis","development of tissue lesions","murine hepatitis virus strain","spleen","lymph node","thymus tissues","macrophages","effector molecule","liver","peripheral tolerance","quantitative RT-PCR","useful strategy","CD8","capacity","protein","response","wild-type","positive CD4","Fluorescence double-staining","WT","littermates","signal","death","inhibitory receptor","manipulation","results"],"language":"en"},

This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein, yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated, in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX. Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) SOX homolog, we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity. Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover. Unexpectedly, the MHV68 mutant showed little defect during the acute replication phase in the mouse lung. Instead, the virus exhibited attenuation at later stages of in vivo infections suggestive of defects in both trafficking and latency establishment. Specifically, mice intranasally infected with the host shutoff mutant accumulated to lower levels at 10 days post infection in the lymph nodes, failed to develop splenomegaly, and exhibited reduced viral DNA levels and a lower frequency of latently infected splenocytes. Decreased latency establishment was also observed upon infection via the intraperitoneal route. These results highlight for the first time the importance of global mRNA degradation during a gammaherpesvirus infection and link an exclusively lytic phenomenon with downstream latency establishment.","publish_time":"2011-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richner, Justin M.; Clyde, Karen; Pezda, Andrea C.; Cheng, Benson Yee Hin; Wang, Tina; Kumar, G.

With time, this problem will only become more severe as population density in urban centers grows. Social interactions play a very important role in determining how infectious diseases spread, and organization of people along social lines gives rise to non-spatial networks in which the infections spread. Infection networks are different for diseases with different transmission modes, but are likely to be identical or highly similar for diseases that spread the same way. Hence, infection networks estimated from common infections can be useful to contain epidemics of a more severe disease with the same transmission mode. Here we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the effectiveness of epidemic mitigation based on such estimated infection networks. We first generate artificial social networks of different sizes and average degrees, but with roughly the same clustering characteristic. We then start SIR epidemics on these networks, censor the simulated incidences, and use them to reconstruct the infection network. We then efficiently fragment the estimated network by removing the smallest number of nodes identified by a graph partitioning algorithm.

Two measles outbreaks, occurred in Lazio region during 2006-2007, were investigated to identify sources of infection, transmission routes, and assess operational implications for elimination of the disease. METHODS: Data were obtained from several sources, the routine infectious diseases surveillance system, field epidemiological investigations, and molecular genotyping of virus by the national reference laboratory. RESULTS: Overall 449 cases were reported, sustained by two different stereotypes overlapping for few months. Serotype D4 was likely imported from Romania by a Roma/Sinti family and subsequently spread to the rest of the population. Serotype B3 was responsible for the second outbreak which started in a secondary school. Pockets of low vaccine coverage individuals (Roma/Sinti communities, high school students) facilitated the reintroduction of serotypes not endemic in Italy and facilitated the measles infection to spread. CONCLUSIONS: Communities with low vaccine coverage represent a more serious public health threat than do sporadic susceptible individuals. The successful elimination of measles will require additional efforts to immunize low vaccine coverage population groups, including hard-to-reach individuals, adolescents, and young adults.

GTases are members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which also includes DNA and RNA ligases. GTases catalyze a two-step reaction in which they initially utilize GTP as a substrate to form a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The GMP moiety is then transferred to the diphosphate end of the RNA transcript in the second step of the reaction to form the Gppp-RNA structure. In the current study, we used a combination of virtual database screening, homology modeling, and biochemical assays to search for novel GTase inhibitors. Using this approach, we demonstrate that mycophenolic acid (MPA) can inhibit the GTase reaction by preventing the catalytic transfer of the GMP moiety onto an acceptor RNA. As such, MPA represents a novel type of inhibitor against RNA guanylyltransferases that inhibits the second step of the catalytic reaction. Moreover, we show that the addition of MPA to S. cerevisiae cells leads to a reduction of capped mRNAs. Finally, biochemical assays also demonstrate that MPA can inhibit DNA ligases through inhibition of the second step of the reaction. The biological implications of these findings for the MPA-mediated inhibition of members of the covalent nucleotidyl superfamily are discussed.","publish_time":"2011-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tremblay-L\u00E9tourneau, Maude; Despins, Simon; Bougie, Isabelle; Bisaillon, Martin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54b6c7145a0f7743409d5590780ef253152873dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3174198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA ligases","RNA guanylyltransferases","RNA transcript","acceptor RNA","GTase reaction","Gppp-RNA structure","catalytic reaction","addition of MPA","Gppp-RNA cap structure","two-step reaction","MPA-mediated inhibition of members","GMP moiety","covalent nucleotidyl superfamily","covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily","biochemical assays","novel GTase inhibitors","covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate","DNA ligases","GTases","end of eukaryotic mRNAs","catalytic transfer","diphosphate end","novel type of inhibitor","reduction of capped mRNAs","homology modeling","combination of virtual database screening","findings","m7","cerevisiae cells","substrate","mycophenolic acid","synthesis","biological implications","approach","current study","GTP"],"language":"en"},

We initiated a nation-wide three-year surveillance of children who were admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with severe seasonal influenza. METHODS: From October 2005 to July 2008, active surveillance was performed using an established reporting system for rare diseases (ESPED) including all paediatric hospitals in Germany. Cases to be reported were hospitalized children \u003C 17 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza treated in a PICU or dying in hospital. RESULTS: Twenty severe influenza-associated cases were reported from 14 PICUs during three pre-pandemic influenza seasons (2005-2008). The median age of the patients (12 males/8 females) was 7.5 years (range 0.1-15 years). None had received vaccination against influenza. In 14 (70%) patients, the infection had been caused by influenza A and in five (25%) by influenza B; in one child (5%) the influenza type was not reported. Patients spent a median of 19 (IQR 12-38) days in the hospital and a median of 11 days (IQR 6-18 days) in the PICU; 10 (50%) needed mechanical ventilation. Most frequent diagnoses were influenza-associated pneumonia (60%), bronchitis/bronchiolitis (30%), encephalitis/encephalopathy (25%), secondary bacterial pneumonia (25%), and ARDS (25%). Eleven (55%) children had chronic underlying medical conditions, including 8 (40%) with chronic pulmonary diseases. Two influenza A- associated deaths were reported: i) an 8-year old boy with pneumococcal encephalopathy following influenza infection died from cerebral edema, ii) a 14-year-old boy with asthma bronchiale, cardiac malformation and Addison\u0027s disease died from cardiac and respiratory failure. For nine (45%) patients, possibly permanent sequelae were reported (3 neurological, 3 pulmonary, 3 other sequelae). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza-associated pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections are relevant complications of seasonal influenza in Germany. The incidence of severe influenza cases in PICUs was relatively low. This may be either due to the weak to moderate seasonal influenza activity during the years 2005 to 2008 or due to under-diagnosis of influenza by physicians. Fifty% of the observed severe cases might have been prevented by following the recommendations for vaccination of risk groups in Germany.","publish_time":"2011-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Streng, Andrea; Grote, Veit; Liese, Johannes G","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1918fa9f909caf84106181d8db5e48055934107e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3175218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Addison"],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["influenza infection","influenza B","influenza type","severe seasonal influenza","influenza-associated pneumonia","severe influenza-associated cases","incidence of severe influenza cases","under-diagnosis of influenza","seasonal influenza virus infection","relevant complications of seasonal influenza","moderate seasonal influenza activity","pre-pandemic influenza seasons","patients","days","observed severe cases","years of age","Germany","associated deaths","median age","secondary bacterial pneumonia","PICUs","nation-wide three-year surveillance of children","chronic pulmonary diseases","IQR","secondary bacterial infections","cardiac malformation","year-old boy","pneumococcal encephalopathy","rare diseases","paediatric hospitals","active surveillance","permanent sequelae","year old boy","vaccination of risk groups","paediatric intensive care unit","chronic underlying medical conditions","Addison\u0027s disease","asthma bronchiale","ESPED","established reporting system","females","Data","frequent diagnoses","respiratory failure","cerebral edema","recommendations","BACKGROUND","physicians","range","laboratory","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","bronchiolitis","encephalitis","bronchitis","mechanical ventilation","METHODS","ARDS"],"language":"en"},

Three mAbs, HJ16, HGN194 and HK20, were obtained from patients within the HIV-1 cohort of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM). Our aim was to generate immunization antibodies equivalent to those seen in plasma. Here, we describe the selection and characterization of patient plasma and their mAbs, using a range of neutralization assays, including several peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) based assays and replicating primary viruses as well as cell line based assays and pseudoviruses (PV). The principal criterion for selection of patient plasma was the activity in an \u2018extended incubation phase\u2019 PBMC assay. Neutralizing Abs, derived from their memory B cells, were then selected by ELISA with envelope proteins as solid phase. MAbs were subsequently tested in a high-throughput HOS-PV assay to assess functional neutralization. The present study indicates that the strong profiles in the patients\u0027 plasma were not solely due to antibodies represented by the newly isolated mAbs. Although results from the various assays were divergent, they by and large indicate that neutralizing Abs to other epitopes of the HIV-1 envelope are present in the plasma and synergy between Abs may be important. Thus, the spectrum of the obtained mAbs does not cover the range of cross-reactivity seen in plasma in these carefully selected patients irrespective of which neutralization assay is used. Nevertheless, these mAbs are relevant for immunogen discovery because they bind to the recombinant glycoproteins to which the immune response needs to be targeted in vivo.

To obtain an overview of humoral immune responses to these viruses, we generated a protein array that displayed 174 EBV and KSHV polypeptides purified from yeast. Antibody responses to EBV and KSHV were examined in plasma from healthy volunteers and patients with B cell lymphoma or with AIDS-related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma or lymphoma. Results. In addition to the commonly studied antigens, IgG responses were frequently detected to the tegument proteins KSHV ORF38 and EBV BBRF and BGLF2 and BNRF1 and to the EBV early lytic proteins BRRF1 and BORF2.

The electrical signals allow synchronization of ventilation to spontaneous breathing efforts of a child, as well as permitting pressure assistance proportional to the electrical signal. NAVA provides equally fine synchronization of respiratory support and pressure assistance varying with the needs of the child. NAVA has mainly been studied in children who underwent cardiac surgery during the period of weaning from a respirator. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a series of 3 children (1 month, 3 years, and 28 days old) with severe respiratory distress due to RSV-related bronchiolitis requiring invasive mechanical ventilation with a high level of oxygen (FiO(2 )\u226550%) for whom NAVA facilitated respiratory support. One of these children had diagnosis criteria for acute lung injury, another for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Establishment of NAVA provided synchronization of mechanical ventilatory support with the breathing efforts of the children. Respiratory rate and inspiratory pressure became extremely variable, varying at each cycle, while children were breathing easily and smoothly. All three children demonstrated less oxygen requirements after introducing NAVA (57 \u00B1 6% to 42 \u00B1 18%). This improvement was observed while peak airway pressure decreased (28 \u00B1 3 to 15 \u00B1 5 cm H(2)O). In one child, NAVA facilitated the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome with extensive subcutaneous emphysema. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the feasibility and benefit of NAVA in children with severe RSV-related bronchiolitis. NAVA provides a less aggressive ventilation requiring lower inspiratory pressures with good results for oxygenation and more comfort for the children.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liet, Jean-Michel; Dejode, Jean-Marc; Joram, Nicolas; Roux, B\u00E9n\u00E9dicte Gaillard-Le; B\u00E9tr\u00E9mieux, Pierre; Roz\u00E9, Jean-Christophe","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4313564fec59facf82281a6de7eb1b690603daa9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3207882.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3207882/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzExMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAVA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","benefit of NAVA","Establishment of NAVA","severe respiratory distress","synchronization of ventilation","Respiratory rate","fine synchronization of respiratory support","management of acute respiratory distress syndrome","synchronization of mechanical ventilatory support","invasive mechanical ventilation","aggressive ventilation","new mode of mechanical ventilation","severe RSV-related bronchiolitis","permitting pressure assistance proportional","peak airway pressure","spontaneous breathing efforts","diaphragmatic electrical signals","acute lung injury","ventilatory assist","oxygen requirements","lower inspiratory pressures","high level of oxygen","good results","oxygenation","extensive subcutaneous emphysema","diagnosis criteria","days old","feasibility","period of weaning","cardiac surgery","years","comfort","Neurally","findings","BACKGROUND","FiO","improvement","series","month","needs","CONCLUSIONS","cycle","CASE PRESENTATION"],"language":"en"},

However the importance of transmission via fomites is unclear since few data exist on the survival of virus on commonly touched surfaces. We therefore measured the viability over time of two H1N1 influenza strains applied to a variety of materials commonly found in households and workplaces. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 (PR8) or A/Cambridge/AHO4/2009 (pandemic H1N1) viruses were inoculated onto a wide range of surfaces used in home and work environments, then sampled at set times following incubation at stabilised temperature and humidity. Virus genome was measured by RT-PCR; plaque assay (for PR8) or fluorescent focus formation (for pandemic H1N1) was used to assess the survival of viable virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome of either virus could be detected on most surfaces 24 h after application with relatively little drop in copy number, with the exception of unsealed wood surfaces. In contrast, virus viability dropped much more rapidly. Live virus was recovered from most surfaces tested four hours after application and from some non-porous materials after nine hours, but had fallen below the level of detection from all surfaces at 24 h. We conclude that influenza A transmission via fomites is possible but unlikely to occur for long periods after surface contamination (unless re-inoculation occurs). In situations involving a high probability of influenza transmission, our data suggest a hierarchy of priorities for surface decontamination in the multi-surface environments of home and hospitals.","publish_time":"2011-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greatorex, Jane S.; Digard, Paul; Curran, Martin D.; Moynihan, Robert; Wensley, Harrison; Wreghitt, Tim; Varsani, Harsha; Garcia, Fayna; Enstone, Joanne; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c56d753d8b3c0fb68cb1bd22f0b7d10eb3c08e93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3222642.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["touched surfaces","Virus genome","survival of virus","virus viability","Live virus","majority of influenza transmission","H1N1 influenza strains","survival of viable virus","high probability of influenza transmission","wide range of surfaces","pandemic H1N1","importance of transmission","exception of unsealed wood surfaces","surface decontamination","surface contamination","multi-surface environments of home","application","PR8","data","fomites","hours","workplaces","work environments","variety of materials","non-porous materials","set times","fluorescent focus formation","incubation","stabilised temperature","copy number","little drop","long periods","RT-PCR","hierarchy of priorities","homes","plaque assay","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","viruses","PuertoRico","hospitals","schools","re-inoculation","humidity","Cambridge","households","METHODOLOGY","situations","AHO4","SIGNIFICANCE","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","level of detection","contrast","communal items"],"language":"en"},

We track the evolution of 16 disease outbreaks using 5 temporal aberration detection algorithms on text-mined events classified according to disease and outbreak country. Using ProMED reports as a silver standard, comparative analysis of news data for 13 languages over a 129 day trial period showed improved sensitivity, F1 and timeliness across most models using cross-lingual events. We report a detailed case study analysis for Cholera in Angola 2010 which highlights the challenges faced in correlating news events with the silver standard.

Success requires better understanding of parents\u0027 perceptions of diseases and consequent decisions about vaccinations, however few studies have considered this from the theoretical perspectives of risk perception and decision-making under uncertainty. The aim of this study was to examine the utility of subjective risk perception and decision-making theories to provide a better understanding of the differences between immunisers\u0027 and non-immunisers\u0027 health beliefs and behaviours. METHODS: In a qualitative study we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 45 Australian parents exploring their experiences and perceptions of disease severity and susceptibility. Using scenarios about \u0027a new strain of flu\u0027 we explored how risk information was interpreted. RESULTS: We found that concepts of dread, unfamiliarity, and uncontrollability from the subjective perception of risk and ambiguity, optimistic control and omission bias from explanatory theories of decision-making under uncertainty were useful in understanding why immunisers, incomplete immunisers and non-immunisers interpreted severity and susceptibility to diseases and vaccine risk differently. Immunisers dreaded unfamiliar diseases whilst non-immunisers dreaded unknown, long term side effects of vaccines. Participants believed that the risks of diseases and complications from diseases are not equally spread throughout the community, therefore, when listening to reports of epidemics, it is not the number of people who are affected but the familiarity or unfamiliarity of the disease and the characteristics of those who have had the disease that prompts them to take preventive action. Almost all believed they themselves would not be at serious risk of the \u0027new strain of flu\u0027 but were less willing to take risks with their children\u0027s health. CONCLUSION: This study has found that health messages about the risks of disease which are communicated as though there is equality of risk in the population may be unproductive as these messages are perceived as unbelievable or irrelevant. The findings from this study have implications beyond the issue of childhood vaccinations as we grapple with communicating risks of new epidemics, and indeed may usefully contribute to the current debate especially in the UK of how these theories of risk and decision-making can be used to \u0027nudge\u0027 other health behaviours.","publish_time":"2011-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bond, Lyndal; Nolan, Terry","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37095beb85663a5f3c4e7a1175e5bff2c6c97855.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3260331.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["theories of risk","risks of diseases","vaccine risk","serious risk","equality of risk","risk information","subjective perception of risk","decision-making theories","utility of subjective risk perception","health messages","health behaviours","theoretical perspectives of risk perception","incomplete immunisers","unfamiliar diseases","public health","children\u0027s health","non-immunisers\u0027 health beliefs","explanatory theories of decision-making","perceptions of disease severity","better understanding of parents\u0027 perceptions of diseases","qualitative study","communicating risks of new epidemics","new strain of flu","issue of childhood vaccinations","susceptibility","uncertainty","unfamiliarity","high levels of childhood vaccinations","omission bias","optimistic control","ambiguity","Australian parents","semi-structured in-depth interviews","long term","differences","consequent decisions","experiences","implications","uncontrollability","population","Success","UK","effects of vaccines","concepts of dread","BACKGROUND","studies","nudge","complications","current debate","number of people","METHODS","findings","scenarios","characteristics","Participants","preventive action","RESULTS","aim","CONCLUSION","community"],"language":"en"},

Habitat \u201Chotspots\u201D - places attracting a large numbers of individuals or social groups - can significantly alter contact patterns and, hence, disease propagation. Research on the importance of habitat hotspots in wildlife epidemiology has primarily focused on how inter-individual contacts occurring at the hotspot itself increase disease transmission. However, in territorial animals, epidemiologically important contacts may primarily occur as animals cross through territories of conspecifics en route to habitat hotspots. So far, the phenomenon has received little attention. Here, we investigate the importance of these contacts in the case where infectious individuals keep visiting the hotspots and in the case where these individuals are not able to travel to the hotspot any more. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a simulation epidemiological model to investigate both cases in a scenario when transmission at the hotspot does not occur. We find that (i) hotspots still exacerbate epidemics, (ii) when infectious individuals do not travel to the hotspot, the most vulnerable individuals are those residing at intermediate distances from the hotspot rather than nearby, and (iii) the epidemiological vulnerability of a population is the highest when the number of hotspots is intermediate. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: By altering animal movements in their vicinity, habitat hotspots can thus strongly increase the spread of infectious diseases, even when disease transmission does not occur at the hotspot itself. Interestingly, when animals only visit the nearest hotspot, creating additional artificial hotspots, rather than reducing their number, may be an efficient disease control measure.","publish_time":"2012-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benavides, Julio; Walsh, Peter D.; Meyers, Lauren Ancel; Raymond, Michel; Caillaud, Damien","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b87c5054e29782b51940d6ab29ce3ca2b27d54b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3282722.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3282722/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of hotspots","importance of habitat hotspots","infectious individuals","nearest hotspot","disease transmission","additional artificial hotspots","vulnerable individuals","spread of infectious diseases","important contacts","host contacts","disease propagation","large numbers of individuals","animals cross","inter-individual contacts","territorial animals","efficient disease control measure","wildlife populations","wildlife epidemiology","contact patterns","epidemiological vulnerability","intermediate distances","simulation epidemiological model","social groups","cases","animal movements","territories of conspecifics","places","vicinity","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","SIGNIFICANCE","BACKGROUND","scenario","Research","phenomenon","little attention","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

Here, we link host susceptibility to viral infection to a network encompassing sulfur metabolism, tRNA modification, competitive binding, and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). We first demonstrate that the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli exerts a protective effect during lambda phage infection, while a tRNA thiolation pathway enhances viral infection. We show that tRNA(Lys) uridine 34 modification inhibits PRF to influence the ratio of lambda phage proteins gpG and gpGT. Computational modeling and experiments suggest that the role of the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway in infection is indirect, via competitive binding of the shared sulfur donor IscS. Based on the universality of many key components of this network, in both the host and the virus, we anticipate that these findings may have broad relevance to understanding other infections, including viral infection of humans.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maynard, Nathaniel D; Macklin, Derek N; Kirkegaard, Karla; Covert, Markus W","journal":"Mol Syst Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/917a712ae9de91c110d7ff33eb71913c67309527.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3296357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3296357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection of humans","lambda phage infection","viral factors","iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway","tRNA modification","tRNA thiolation pathway","competitive binding","network encompassing sulfur metabolism","PRF","host susceptibility","shared sulfur donor IscS","ratio of lambda phage proteins gpG","Escherichia coli","protective effect","complex interplay","role","infections","gpGT","ribosomal frameshifting","Lys","uridine","findings","experiments","broad relevance","key components","Computational modeling","universality","virus"],"language":"en"},

Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.","publish_time":"2012-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, Ben S.; Kypraios, Theodore; Batra, Rahul; Wyncoll, Duncan; Tosas, Olga; Edgeworth, Jonathan D.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de15170cb79d459586be28d687e7d68117990644.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a50f2af4833bd314b5664e5f30a6d39792a73f5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3325179.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3325179/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRSA screening data","dominant endemic MRSA clones","patients free of MRSA","ST239-TW MRSA clone","concurrent MRSA outbreak","pandemic MRSA lineage","Asian ST239 MRSA strain","transmission of endemic clones","higher risks of transmitting MRSA","common subtypes","endemic settings","hospital settings","transmission events","time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens","specific pathogen subtypes","routine surveillance data","parametric transmission model","different sources","quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility","ICUs patients","potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures","United Kingdom","ST36","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","ST22","estimating reproduction numbers","serial intervals","probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees","relative hazards","linked adult intensive care units","probabilities","retrospective observational study","anecdotal reports","pathogen\u0027s success","use of topical antiseptics","approaches","important determinant","support","hypothesis","methods","question","variation","results","rate","susceptible hosts","findings"],"language":"en"},

Based on clinical observation in humans and successful genetic strategies in experimental models, we reasoned that an improved interferon (IFN) signaling system might better protect against viral infection. Here we aimed to identify small molecular weight compounds that might mimic this beneficial effect and improve antiviral defense. Accordingly, we developed a cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify small molecules that enhance the IFN signaling pathway components. The assay is based on a phenotypic screen for increased IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity in a fully automated and robust format (Z\u2032\u003E0.7). Application of this assay system to a library of 2240 compounds (including 2160 already approved or approvable drugs) led to the identification of 64 compounds with significant ISRE activity. From these, we chose the anthracycline antibiotic, idarubicin, for further validation and mechanism based on activity in the sub-\u00B5M range. We found that idarubicin action to increase ISRE activity was manifest by other members of this drug class and was independent of cytotoxic or topoisomerase inhibitory effects as well as endogenous IFN signaling or production. We also observed that this compound conferred a consequent increase in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and a significant antiviral effect using a similar dose-range in a cell-culture system inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The antiviral effect was also found at compound concentrations below the ones observed for cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results provide proof of concept for using activators of components of the IFN signaling pathway to improve IFN efficacy and antiviral immune defense as well as a validated HTS approach to identify small molecules that might achieve this therapeutic benefit.","publish_time":"2012-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Dhara A.; Patel, Anand C.; Nolan, William C.; Zhang, Yong; Holtzman, Michael J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0867cf1922a634eefb3a3ad07f4dc6c9c94828ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3344904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3344904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN efficacy","endogenous IFN","antiviral defense","IFN-stimulated gene","significant antiviral effect","significant ISRE activity","assay system","antiviral immune defense","antiviral therapeutics","increased IFN-stimulated response element","small molecules","immune response","cell-culture system","beneficial effect","small molecular weight compounds","pathway components","similar dose-range","validated HTS approach","broad range of viruses","sub-\u00B5M range","current strategies","encephalomyocarditis virus","drug class","drug discovery","compound concentrations","alternative approach","idarubicin action","consequent increase","activators of components","successful genetic strategies","independent of cytotoxic","humans","expression","ISG","topoisomerase inhibitory effects","phenotypic screen","experimental models","identification","high-throughput screening","clinical observation","validation","mechanism","members","proof of concept","robust format","improved interferon","ones","EMCV","library","anthracycline antibiotic","therapeutic benefit","results","cytotoxicity","approvable drugs","viral infection","production","Application"],"language":"en"},

The key actors mediating the biogenesis of these carriers are the autophagy-related genes (ATGs). For a long time, it was assumed that autophagy is a bulk process. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the capacity of this pathway to exclusively eliminate specific structures and thus better fulfil the catabolic necessities of the cell. We are just starting to unveil the regulation and mechanism of these selective types of autophagy, but what it is already clearly emerging is that structures targeted to destruction are accurately enwrapped by autophagosomes through the action of specific receptors and adaptors.

In an attempt to increase the frequency of stem cell fusion and, in so doing, increase the potential for cardiac tissue repair, we expressed the fusogen of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) in human MSCs. We found VSV-G expressing MSCs (vMSCs) fused with cardiomyocytes (CMs) and these fusion products adopted a CM-like phenotype and morphology in vitro. In vivo, vMSCs delivered to damaged mouse myocardium via a collagen patch were able to home to the myocardium and fuse to cells within the infarct and peri-infarct region of the myocardium.

This suggests that recombinant proteins containing RBD and vectors encoding the RBD sequence can be used to develop safe and effective SARS vaccines.","publish_time":"2005-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Shibo; He, Yuxian; Liu, Shuwen","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8fd65777b69f5f9b7177a709e22607eb96abfa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3371787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3371787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of SARS","effective SARS vaccines","inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine","RBD sequence","safe vaccines","S1 subunit of S protein","multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes","major inducer of neutralizing antibodies","severe acute respiratory syndrome","associated coronavirus","infection","vectors","receptor-binding domain","safety","clinical use","recombinant proteins","spike","main concern"],"language":"en"},

Epitope mimicry may indeed be involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as post\u2010viral myocarditis or Chagas disease, but for many other diseases in which it has been implicated, such as insulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitis or rheumatoid arthritis, convincing evidence is still lacking. Even if an epitope mimic can support a cross\u2010reactive T or B cell response in vitro, its ability to induce an autoimmune disease in vivo will depend upon the appropriate presentation of the mimicked host antigen in the target tissue and, in the case of T cell mimics, the ability of the mimicking epitope to induce a proliferative rather than anergizing response upon engagement of the MHC\u2010peptide complex with the T cell receptor. B cell presentation of mimicking foreign antigen to T cells is a possible mechanism for instigating an autoimmune response to self antigens that in turn can lead to autoimmune disease under particular conditions of antigen presentation, secondary signalling and effector cell repertoire.

This process begins with the development of an autoimmune cellular repertoire, followed by activation of these autoreactive cells in response to a localized target and, finally, the immune system\u0027s failure to regulate these self reactive constituents. Viruses have long been associated with inciting autoimmune disorders. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how a viral infection can overcome immunological tolerance to self components and initiate an organ specific autoreactive process, these mechanisms arc molecular mimicry and bystander activation. Both pathways, as discussed here, could play pivotal roles in the development of autoimmunity without necessarily excluding each other. Transgene technology has allowed us and others to examine more closely the roles of these mechanisms in mice and to dissect the requirements for initiating disease. These results demonstrate that bystander activation is the must likely explanation fur disease development. Additional evidence suggests a further role for viruses in the reactivation and chronicity of autoimmune diseases. In this scenario, a second invasion by a previously infecting virus may restimulate already existing autoreactive lymphocytes and thereby contribute to the diversity of the immune response.","publish_time":"2006-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horwitz, Marc S.; Sarvetnick, Nora","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1e257d220cff66c3430c759ba5322b57df13a57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms","initiation of autoimmune disease","bystander activation","autoreactive cells","organ specific autoreactive process","stage process","development of autoimmunity","immune response","autoimmune cellular repertoire","chronicity of autoimmune diseases","inciting autoimmune disorders","Viruses","initiating disease","likely explanation fur disease development","existing autoreactive lymphocytes","self components","pivotal roles","self reactive constituents","immune system\u0027s failure","molecular mimicry","immunological tolerance","reactivation","infecting virus","localized target","viral infection","environmental influences","invasion","requirements","diversity","mice","Additional evidence","results","Transgene technology","scenario","Summary","pathways"],"language":"en"},

Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates have revolutionized the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.

Bio Products Laboratory has developed a high\u2010purity FVIII product with von Willebrand factor, Optivate(\u00AE). Its safety, tolerability and efficacy as prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds have been established in long\u2010term studies. Seventy previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A, with \u226520 exposure days, were recruited into two long\u2010term, multicentre, open\u2010label studies. The protocols were virtually identical. Patients received Optivate(\u00AE) either prophylactically or on\u2010demand. A mean of 159.0 EDs were experienced over 11 320 infusions. Under both conditions, Optivate(\u00AE) was well tolerated. Only 10% of patients experienced a treatment\u2010related adverse event; the most commonly reported were headache (4% of patients) and dizziness (3% of patients). The mean number of bleeds/patient over the 2 year treatment period was 23.5 during prophylactic use and 70.4 during on\u2010demand use. In patients treated prophylactically, clinical responses to breakthrough bleeds were rated by physicians as excellent or good and as very helpful or helpful by patients in 95% of bleeds. Clinical responses for on\u2010demand patients were rated as excellent or good by physicians and helpful or very helpful by the patients for 91% of bleeds.

Study Design Descriptive. Methods Records of general and subspecialty outpatient attendance, ward admissions, ward bed occupancy, and elective and emergency surgery were obtained for the period since the SARS outbreak and for an equivalent period before the outbreak. The changes in these parameters were determined against the background of new SARS cases. Results Since the outbreak of SARS in March 2003, the weekly outpatient clinic attendance has declined by 59%, the number of operations performed by 79%, the average ward bed occupancy rate by 79% and the daily admission rate by 84%. A dramatic increase of 300% in the number of patients defaulting on their outpatient appointments was recorded. Conclusion The substantial decrease in otorhinolaryngological services at an academic tertiary referral hospital in Hong Kong has been multifaceted. The decrease in attendance at the outpatient clinics reflects the increased number of patients defaulting on their appointments. Nonessential elective surgery was suspended soon after the outbreak, accounting for the decrease in the number of surgical procedures performed and partially for the decrease in ward bed occupancy and ward admissions. The temporary closure of the accident and emergency department contributed to the decrease in ward admissions and emergency surgical procedures. The reduced service offered by the hospital is having an impact on the quality of care available to patients with non\u2013life\u2010threatening otorhinolaryngological conditions.","publish_time":"2009-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vlantis, Alexander C.; Tsang, Raymond K.

The results on 150 sera from SARS patients and 450 sera from non\u2010SARS controls showed that this assay had a high level of sensitivity (96.2% for late serum samples) and specificity (97.8%). The performance and setup of this assay fulfills the requirement as a screening test for large\u2010scale studies. A vast majority of SARS patients developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein.

In the discipline of medical microbiology, there is no definitive theoretical answer to this question: there, the conditions of aetiological possibility exist in a curious tension. Ever since the late 19(th) century, the \u201Cgerm theory of disease\u201D\u2013\u201Cone disease, one cause\u201D\u2013 has co\u2010existed with a much less well known theory of \u201Cmultifactorality\u201D\u2013\u201Cone disease, many interacting causes\u201D. And yet, in practice, it is always a singular and never a multifactorial aetiology that emerges once the pathogenic world is brought into the field of medical perception.

Based on the physical and chemical properties of amino acids, a new strategy for peptide reagent design, the so\u2010called AABPD (amino acid based\u2010peptide design), is proposed. The peptide samples in a training dataset are described by a series of HMLP (heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential) parameters and other physicochemical properties of amino acid residues that form a three\u2010dimensional data matrix where each component is defined by three indexes: the first index refers to the peptide samples, the second to the amino acid positions, and the third to the amino acid parameters. The binding free energy between a peptide ligand and its protein receptor is calculated by a linear free energy equation through the physicochemical parameters, resulting in a set of simultaneous linear equations between the bioactivity of the peptides and the physicochemical properties of amino acids. An iterative double least square technique is developed for the solution of the three\u2010dimensional simultaneous linear equation set to determine the amino acid position coefficients of peptide sequence and the physicochemical parameter coefficients of amino acid residues alternately. The two sets of coefficients thus obtained are used for predicting the bioactivity of other query peptide reagents. Two calculation examples, the peptide substrate specificity of the SARS coronavirus 3C\u2010like proteinase and the affinity prediction for epitope\u2010peptides with Class I MHC molecules are studied by using the peptide reagent design strategy. \u00A9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

MHV\u20102 was injected intraperitoneally into 4\u2010week\u2010old ICR mice, IFN or the vehicle was administered intramuscularly for 5 days, and the antiviral effect was evaluated based on survival periods, liver histology, serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, and MHV\u20102 virus titers in the liver tissues.

Co\u2010circulating respiratory viruses may obscure the determination of influenza activity. DESIGN: Prospective clinical surveillance for the new onset of respiratory illness followed by viral cultures during seven separate influenza seasons. SETTING: The Wisconsin Veterans Home, a skilled nursing facility for veterans and their spouses. RESULTS: Influenza A isolates were encountered in greater numbers than non\u2010influenza A isolates during three seasons. Seasonal variability is striking. In December 1992, we identified a large outbreak of respiratory illness. Influenza type B was cultured from 102 residents. In December 1995, influenza A was cultured from 285 people in Wisconsin. At that time, we identified outbreaks of respiratory illness in two of our four buildings. Based on statewide data, we suspected an influenza outbreak; however, 26 isolates of parainfluenza virus type 1 were cultured with no influenza. The potential importance of culturing at the end of the season was demonstrated in 1991\u20131992 when an outbreak of respiratory syn\u2010cytial virus (RSV) overlapped and extended beyond influenza A activity. CONCLUSIONS: When interpreting new clinical respiratory illnesses as a basis for declaring an outbreak of influenza A, clinicians should realize that co\u2010circulating respiratory viruses can account for clinical illnesses. Clinicians might utilize healthcare dollars efficiently by performing cultures to focus the timing of influenza A chemoprophylaxis. Cultures could be performed when clinical outbreak criteria are approached to confirm an outbreak. Culturing of new respiratory illness could begin again before the anticipated discontinuation of prophylaxis (approximately 2 weeks).

Scale organs in these families are concentrated on the face, and scale organs occur singly or in pairs below the keel on the dorsals of cordylids but not gerrhosaurids. Most species examined possess primitive, lenticular scale organs. Unique and previously unknown, projecting scale organs occur in two species of Cordylus. Scale organs appear to be absent in species of Chamaesaura. The scale surfaces of cordylids are covered in macrohoneycomb. Individual compartments of cordylid macrohoneycomb are not intracellular structures but may be overlain by apparent oberhautchen cells. In some cordylid species, part of each cell is free and projects away from the scale surface as a pointed flap. Gerrhosaurids lack macrohoneycomb. Instead, their scale surfaces are covered in lamellae without dentate borders, 50\u2013100 times as long as wide. The epidermis of Platysaurus is unique among cordylids in possessing lamellae 1\u20138 times as wide as long that overlap macrohoneycomb in some regions of the body. The scale surfaces of Cordylus cordylus undergo an ontogenetic change similar to that recently described for the xenosaurid genus Shinisaurus. Phylogenetic analysis of scale surface features allows the partitioning of Cordylus into three species groups and Chamaesaura into two species groups. Synapomorphies of the species of Chamaesaura, the species of Platysaurus, and the genera of the gerrhosaurids are also described. \u00A9 1995 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harvey, Michael B.; Gutberlet, Ronald L.","journal":"J Morphol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7483edc67d185d1364042d1090343179a4397cc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of Cordylus","cordylid species","species of Chamaesaura","species groups","species of Platysaurus","projecting scale organs","scale surfaces of cordylids","lenticular scale organs","scale surfaces of Cordylus cordylus","Phylogenetic analysis of scale surface features","Gerrhosaurids lack macrohoneycomb","partitioning of Cordylus","genus of cordylid","Individual compartments of cordylid macrohoneycomb","lamellae","dorsals of cordylids","times","distal oberhautchen","epidermis of Platysaurus","apparent oberhautchen cells","xenosaurid genus Shinisaurus","proximal beta layer","gerrhosaurid lizard","ontogenetic change similar","intracellular structures","projects","pairs","dentate borders","scanning electron microscope","keel","pointed flap","families","genera","regions","body","Synapomorphies","Wiley","Liss"],"language":"en"},

To estimate the amount of immune stimulation, nasal immune responses were examined during rhinovirus and RSV\u2010induced URTI in infants. Nasal brush samples were taken from infants (2\u201326 months; 57% atopic family) with rhinovirus\u2010induced URTI (N = 20), with RSV\u2010induced URTI (N = 7), and with rhinovirus\u2010induced rhinitis (N = 11), from children with asymptomatic rhinovirus infection (N = 7) and from eight non\u2010infected children. Numbers of nasal brush cells positive for Th1\u2010, Th2\u2010, regulatory and proinflammatory cytokines were measured by immunohistochemistry or by measuring protein levels using a cytometric bead array analysis. During rhinovirus and RSV\u2010induced URTI, fewer regulatory cytokine IL\u201010 positive cells were found compared to non\u2010infected children. This fall was accompanied by an increase in levels of the Th1 cytokine TNF\u03B1. IL\u201010 responses were inversely related to TNF\u03B1 responses. No enhanced responses were observed for IFN\u03B3, IL\u201012 and IL\u201018. Cytokine responses were comparable in children with rhinovirus\u2010induced URTI and in children with rhinitis, while responses in asymptomatic rhinovirus\u2010infected children were located between those for symptomatic and asymptomatic rhinovirus\u2010infected children. Cytokine responses did not depend on the age of the child or atopy in the family. In conclusion, reduced nasal IL\u201010 responses during URTI in infants could facilitate the induction of a TNF\u03B1 response. TNF\u03B1 in turn could replace the immature production of IL\u201012, IL\u201018 and IFN\u03B3 during URTI to induce an effective clearance of the viral infection and which could stimulate the maturation of Th1 cytokine production in infancy.

Autoreactive T lymphocytes directed against myelin components seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been suggested that molecular mimicry between viral and self\u2010antigens might be one of the mechanisms that determine the onset of several autoimmune diseases. Following this hypothesis, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate if HHV\u20106 could play a role in activating T cells capable of cross\u2010reaction with an important myelin component, the myelin basic protein. T cell lines were established from 22 multiple sclerosis patients and from 16 healthy controls, and their capability to react to both virus and myelin basic protein antigens was compared. The analysis of T cell cross\u2010reactivity in patients and controls did not show significant differences in the HHV\u20106 ability to activate myelin basic protein\u2010reactive T cells. Similarly, the evaluation of the humoral immune response to HHV\u20106 in patients and controls did not mirror any abnormality in the HHV\u20106 status in multiple sclerosis patients. Therefore, although the findings of activity in vitro of T cell lines with dual specificity are consistent with the hypothesis of molecular mimicry, the lack of differences in cross\u2010reactivity between patients and controls do not support molecular mimicry as an important mechanism in the physiopathology of this disease.
